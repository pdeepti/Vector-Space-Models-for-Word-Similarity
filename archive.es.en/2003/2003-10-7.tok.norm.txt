nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .
two weeks ago , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet agreed to send up to 450 soldiers to kunduz in an effort to bring stability to the lawless regions outside of kabul and provide extra stability for the government of hamid karzai .
karzai and the united nations have been pleading with the united states and its allies to expand the scope of the peacekeeping mission beyond kabul .

diplomats said kunduz could prove a testing ground for future expansions to include additional regions .
the 19-member nato is reportedly considering seven other regions where soldiers could be stationed . germany needs both the nato and u.n. approval before the bundestag can discuss dispatching additional troops to afghanistan .
germany makes up the lion 's share of the 5,500 isaf force in kabul at the moment .
schröder and his defense minister , peter struck , have been eager to emphasize germany 's commitment to the war-torn country .
struck sent a reconnaissance team at the end of september to examine the possibility of sending soldiers to kunduz , and they returned with approval . struck wanted nato and u.n. approval as soon as possible so that german soldiers could start heading to kunduz before the fierce winter begins .
the contingent will be increased to 250 soldiers by may , with the possibility of expanding to 450 .

nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .
two weeks ago , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet agreed to send up to 450 soldiers to kunduz in an effort to bring stability to the lawless regions outside of kabul and provide extra stability for the government of hamid karzai .
karzai and the united nations have been pleading with the united states and its allies to expand the scope of the peacekeeping mission beyond kabul .
the regions outside the afghan capital are ruled by feuding warlords and provide plenty of cover for dangerous nests of taliban and al qaeda fighters .
future troop deployments also considered the united nations said it would look at expanding the u.n. mandate carried by the nato-led international security assistance force in the first week of november .
diplomats said kunduz could prove a testing ground for future expansions to include additional regions .
the 19-member nato is reportedly considering seven other regions where soldiers could be stationed . germany needs both the nato and u.n. approval before the bundestag can discuss dispatching additional troops to afghanistan .
germany makes up the lion 's share of the 5,500 isaf force in kabul at the moment .
schröder and his defense minister , peter struck , have been eager to emphasize germany 's commitment to the war-torn country .
struck sent a reconnaissance team at the end of september to examine the possibility of sending soldiers to kunduz , and they returned with approval . struck wanted nato and u.n. approval as soon as possible so that german soldiers could start heading to kunduz before the fierce winter begins .
the contingent will be increased to 250 soldiers by may , with the possibility of expanding to 450 .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .

even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .

leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .
the italians , who now hold the rotating eu presidency , want to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects like roads and highways .
germany and france put forward a plan in september that looks to create growth by investing in high-tech projects such as broadband networks , digital broadcasting and satellite navigation systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.10.2003 eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deficit is this big , says finance minister hans eichel .
finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .

though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .

" there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .
" the pensioners will not forgive those politically responsible , " he told the berliner zeitung . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder links " political fate " to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .
" the pensioners will not forgive those politically responsible , " he told the berliner zeitung . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder links " political fate " to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .

a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .

" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "

gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .

moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .

" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .

he praising their efforts towards mideast peace , but said they must do more to fight terrorism . on the final day of his visit to saudi arabia , german chancellor gerhard schröder challenged his hosts to increase their efforts in fighting terrorism and criticized the saudis for financially supporting groups which engaged in what he called the spread of “ religious propaganda ” in germany . at a press conference which was attended by saudi leaders , schröder accused charities from within the kingdom of working with muslim extremists in his own country .
“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .
schröder did not elaborate on his statement but added that german and saudi interior ministers would be meeting in the near future to “ find a way of cooperating in the fight against terrorism . ” german spies monitor saudis at home it was revealed in august that german secret services had been monitoring saudi embassies , diplomatic missions and other facilities in germany amid suspicions that saudi arabia was supporting extremist networks such as al qaeda . the german news magazine der spiegel revealed that security forces had been conducting the surveillance under orders from schröder ’ s government , which now ranks the rich arab kingdom and syria among the countries considered to present an threat from radical muslims .
the magazine cited a source within the german secret service as saying the saudi religious affairs minister in particular had offered “ advice and active support " to militants . praise for mediation the chancellor offset his confrontational words on extremism and terrorism with praise for saudi attempts to keep the middle east peace process on track .
schröder was complimentary of riyadh ’ s initiative , which is designed to engage israel with the arab world in exchange for a full withdrawal from territory occupied since 1967 . “ we share your concern about the situation in the middle east , ” the german chancellor told saudi leaders . “ however , the conflict can ’ t be settled militarily but only through political means , ” he added , saying that the u.s. road map offered an appropriate framework to work out the israel-palestinian conflict . “ we have great hope in the road map ... and both sides to the conflict must immediately respect its clauses in full , ” schröder said , pledging germany ’ s commitment to working with “ key countries ” of the middle east to find a political solution to the arab-israeli conflict . germany committed to rebuilding iraq one of the most important steps towards stabilization in the region , schröder said , was the resolution of the current situation in iraq .
the chancellor again said his country would participate in the reconstruction process , saying : “ germany will be involved in the training of iraqi security and police personnel , ” but the details were to be worked out .
when questioned on the draft resolution put forward by the united states to the u.n. security council this week , the chancellor reiterated his dissatisfaction with the proposal .
“ we believe the wording of this resolution needs to be improved , which is possible .
and we have told this to our partners and our friends in the united states and in france , ” schröder said .
schröder favors u.n. approach the u.s. wants to share the military and financial burden of the reconstruction of iraq with other countries but has set no date for the end of the american occupation .
germany remains committed to a swift return to iraqi sovereignty and a larger role for the united nations , which has put it at odds with the united states . “ we need a realistic calendar for a progressive transfer of political responsibilities to competent iraqi parties , ” schröder said .
“ we strongly back a strengthening of the role of the united nations in such an interim process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.10.2003 spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing rebels from his own party have been a constant headache for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .
" the pensioners will not forgive those politically responsible , " he told the berliner zeitung . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder links " political fate " to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.10.2003 belgian museum wants to set record straight on colonial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the offerings on show at the royal museum for central africa in belgium .
belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .

lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .

" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .

gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !

maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .

even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .
" the pensioners will not forgive those politically responsible , " he told the berliner zeitung . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder links " political fate " to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.10.2003 eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's deficit is this big , says finance minister hans eichel .
finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .
the italians , who now hold the rotating eu presidency , want to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects like roads and highways .
germany and france put forward a plan in september that looks to create growth by investing in high-tech projects such as broadband networks , digital broadcasting and satellite navigation systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .

if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.10.2003 belgian museum wants to set record straight on colonial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the offerings on show at the royal museum for central africa in belgium .
belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .

moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .

" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .
" the pensioners will not forgive those politically responsible , " he told the berliner zeitung . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder links " political fate " to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms .

he praising their efforts towards mideast peace , but said they must do more to fight terrorism . on the final day of his visit to saudi arabia , german chancellor gerhard schröder challenged his hosts to increase their efforts in fighting terrorism and criticized the saudis for financially supporting groups which engaged in what he called the spread of “ religious propaganda ” in germany . at a press conference which was attended by saudi leaders , schröder accused charities from within the kingdom of working with muslim extremists in his own country .
“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .
schröder did not elaborate on his statement but added that german and saudi interior ministers would be meeting in the near future to “ find a way of cooperating in the fight against terrorism . ” german spies monitor saudis at home it was revealed in august that german secret services had been monitoring saudi embassies , diplomatic missions and other facilities in germany amid suspicions that saudi arabia was supporting extremist networks such as al qaeda . the german news magazine der spiegel revealed that security forces had been conducting the surveillance under orders from schröder ’ s government , which now ranks the rich arab kingdom and syria among the countries considered to present an threat from radical muslims .
the magazine cited a source within the german secret service as saying the saudi religious affairs minister in particular had offered “ advice and active support " to militants . praise for mediation the chancellor offset his confrontational words on extremism and terrorism with praise for saudi attempts to keep the middle east peace process on track .
schröder was complimentary of riyadh ’ s initiative , which is designed to engage israel with the arab world in exchange for a full withdrawal from territory occupied since 1967 . “ we share your concern about the situation in the middle east , ” the german chancellor told saudi leaders . “ however , the conflict can ’ t be settled militarily but only through political means , ” he added , saying that the u.s. road map offered an appropriate framework to work out the israel-palestinian conflict . “ we have great hope in the road map ... and both sides to the conflict must immediately respect its clauses in full , ” schröder said , pledging germany ’ s commitment to working with “ key countries ” of the middle east to find a political solution to the arab-israeli conflict . germany committed to rebuilding iraq one of the most important steps towards stabilization in the region , schröder said , was the resolution of the current situation in iraq .
the chancellor again said his country would participate in the reconstruction process , saying : “ germany will be involved in the training of iraqi security and police personnel , ” but the details were to be worked out .
when questioned on the draft resolution put forward by the united states to the u.n. security council this week , the chancellor reiterated his dissatisfaction with the proposal .
“ we believe the wording of this resolution needs to be improved , which is possible .
and we have told this to our partners and our friends in the united states and in france , ” schröder said .
schröder favors u.n. approach the u.s. wants to share the military and financial burden of the reconstruction of iraq with other countries but has set no date for the end of the american occupation .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .

" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .

if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .

high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .
the italians , who now hold the rotating eu presidency , want to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects like roads and highways .
germany and france put forward a plan in september that looks to create growth by investing in high-tech projects such as broadband networks , digital broadcasting and satellite navigation systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .
two weeks ago , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet agreed to send up to 450 soldiers to kunduz in an effort to bring stability to the lawless regions outside of kabul and provide extra stability for the government of hamid karzai .
karzai and the united nations have been pleading with the united states and its allies to expand the scope of the peacekeeping mission beyond kabul .
the regions outside the afghan capital are ruled by feuding warlords and provide plenty of cover for dangerous nests of taliban and al qaeda fighters .
future troop deployments also considered the united nations said it would look at expanding the u.n. mandate carried by the nato-led international security assistance force in the first week of november .
diplomats said kunduz could prove a testing ground for future expansions to include additional regions .
the 19-member nato is reportedly considering seven other regions where soldiers could be stationed . germany needs both the nato and u.n. approval before the bundestag can discuss dispatching additional troops to afghanistan .
germany makes up the lion 's share of the 5,500 isaf force in kabul at the moment .
schröder and his defense minister , peter struck , have been eager to emphasize germany 's commitment to the war-torn country .
struck sent a reconnaissance team at the end of september to examine the possibility of sending soldiers to kunduz , and they returned with approval . struck wanted nato and u.n. approval as soon as possible so that german soldiers could start heading to kunduz before the fierce winter begins .
the contingent will be increased to 250 soldiers by may , with the possibility of expanding to 450 .

“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .
schröder did not elaborate on his statement but added that german and saudi interior ministers would be meeting in the near future to “ find a way of cooperating in the fight against terrorism . ” german spies monitor saudis at home it was revealed in august that german secret services had been monitoring saudi embassies , diplomatic missions and other facilities in germany amid suspicions that saudi arabia was supporting extremist networks such as al qaeda . the german news magazine der spiegel revealed that security forces had been conducting the surveillance under orders from schröder ’ s government , which now ranks the rich arab kingdom and syria among the countries considered to present an threat from radical muslims .
the magazine cited a source within the german secret service as saying the saudi religious affairs minister in particular had offered “ advice and active support " to militants . praise for mediation the chancellor offset his confrontational words on extremism and terrorism with praise for saudi attempts to keep the middle east peace process on track .
schröder was complimentary of riyadh ’ s initiative , which is designed to engage israel with the arab world in exchange for a full withdrawal from territory occupied since 1967 . “ we share your concern about the situation in the middle east , ” the german chancellor told saudi leaders . “ however , the conflict can ’ t be settled militarily but only through political means , ” he added , saying that the u.s. road map offered an appropriate framework to work out the israel-palestinian conflict . “ we have great hope in the road map ... and both sides to the conflict must immediately respect its clauses in full , ” schröder said , pledging germany ’ s commitment to working with “ key countries ” of the middle east to find a political solution to the arab-israeli conflict . germany committed to rebuilding iraq one of the most important steps towards stabilization in the region , schröder said , was the resolution of the current situation in iraq .
the chancellor again said his country would participate in the reconstruction process , saying : “ germany will be involved in the training of iraqi security and police personnel , ” but the details were to be worked out .
when questioned on the draft resolution put forward by the united states to the u.n. security council this week , the chancellor reiterated his dissatisfaction with the proposal .

schröder favors u.n. approach the u.s. wants to share the military and financial burden of the reconstruction of iraq with other countries but has set no date for the end of the american occupation .
germany remains committed to a swift return to iraqi sovereignty and a larger role for the united nations , which has put it at odds with the united states . “ we need a realistic calendar for a progressive transfer of political responsibilities to competent iraqi parties , ” schröder said .

“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .

" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it .

nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .
two weeks ago , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet agreed to send up to 450 soldiers to kunduz in an effort to bring stability to the lawless regions outside of kabul and provide extra stability for the government of hamid karzai .
karzai and the united nations have been pleading with the united states and its allies to expand the scope of the peacekeeping mission beyond kabul .

future troop deployments also considered the united nations said it would look at expanding the u.n. mandate carried by the nato-led international security assistance force in the first week of november .
diplomats said kunduz could prove a testing ground for future expansions to include additional regions .
the 19-member nato is reportedly considering seven other regions where soldiers could be stationed . germany needs both the nato and u.n. approval before the bundestag can discuss dispatching additional troops to afghanistan .
germany makes up the lion 's share of the 5,500 isaf force in kabul at the moment .
schröder and his defense minister , peter struck , have been eager to emphasize germany 's commitment to the war-torn country .

he praising their efforts towards mideast peace , but said they must do more to fight terrorism . on the final day of his visit to saudi arabia , german chancellor gerhard schröder challenged his hosts to increase their efforts in fighting terrorism and criticized the saudis for financially supporting groups which engaged in what he called the spread of “ religious propaganda ” in germany . at a press conference which was attended by saudi leaders , schröder accused charities from within the kingdom of working with muslim extremists in his own country .
“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .

he praising their efforts towards mideast peace , but said they must do more to fight terrorism . on the final day of his visit to saudi arabia , german chancellor gerhard schröder challenged his hosts to increase their efforts in fighting terrorism and criticized the saudis for financially supporting groups which engaged in what he called the spread of “ religious propaganda ” in germany . at a press conference which was attended by saudi leaders , schröder accused charities from within the kingdom of working with muslim extremists in his own country .
“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .
schröder did not elaborate on his statement but added that german and saudi interior ministers would be meeting in the near future to “ find a way of cooperating in the fight against terrorism . ” german spies monitor saudis at home it was revealed in august that german secret services had been monitoring saudi embassies , diplomatic missions and other facilities in germany amid suspicions that saudi arabia was supporting extremist networks such as al qaeda . the german news magazine der spiegel revealed that security forces had been conducting the surveillance under orders from schröder ’ s government , which now ranks the rich arab kingdom and syria among the countries considered to present an threat from radical muslims .
the magazine cited a source within the german secret service as saying the saudi religious affairs minister in particular had offered “ advice and active support " to militants . praise for mediation the chancellor offset his confrontational words on extremism and terrorism with praise for saudi attempts to keep the middle east peace process on track .
schröder was complimentary of riyadh ’ s initiative , which is designed to engage israel with the arab world in exchange for a full withdrawal from territory occupied since 1967 . “ we share your concern about the situation in the middle east , ” the german chancellor told saudi leaders . “ however , the conflict can ’ t be settled militarily but only through political means , ” he added , saying that the u.s. road map offered an appropriate framework to work out the israel-palestinian conflict . “ we have great hope in the road map ... and both sides to the conflict must immediately respect its clauses in full , ” schröder said , pledging germany ’ s commitment to working with “ key countries ” of the middle east to find a political solution to the arab-israeli conflict . germany committed to rebuilding iraq one of the most important steps towards stabilization in the region , schröder said , was the resolution of the current situation in iraq .
the chancellor again said his country would participate in the reconstruction process , saying : “ germany will be involved in the training of iraqi security and police personnel , ” but the details were to be worked out .
when questioned on the draft resolution put forward by the united states to the u.n. security council this week , the chancellor reiterated his dissatisfaction with the proposal .
“ we believe the wording of this resolution needs to be improved , which is possible .
and we have told this to our partners and our friends in the united states and in france , ” schröder said .
schröder favors u.n. approach the u.s. wants to share the military and financial burden of the reconstruction of iraq with other countries but has set no date for the end of the american occupation .
germany remains committed to a swift return to iraqi sovereignty and a larger role for the united nations , which has put it at odds with the united states . “ we need a realistic calendar for a progressive transfer of political responsibilities to competent iraqi parties , ” schröder said .
“ we strongly back a strengthening of the role of the united nations in such an interim process .
only the un can guarantee the necessary legitimacy for rapid reconstruction in iraq under an independent government that represents all iraqis . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bombings rekindle terrorism fears in europe interior ministers of the eu ’ s “ big five ” countries are meeting to review security amid a backdrop of devastating bombings and fears in europe that al qaeda activity is on the rise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.10.2003 belgian museum wants to set record straight on colonial past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the offerings on show at the royal museum for central africa in belgium .
belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .

the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .
the italians , who now hold the rotating eu presidency , want to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects like roads and highways .
germany and france put forward a plan in september that looks to create growth by investing in high-tech projects such as broadband networks , digital broadcasting and satellite navigation systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .
the italians , who now hold the rotating eu presidency , want to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects like roads and highways .
germany and france put forward a plan in september that looks to create growth by investing in high-tech projects such as broadband networks , digital broadcasting and satellite navigation systems . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .
" the pensioners will not forgive those politically responsible , " he told the berliner zeitung . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder links " political fate " to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms .

“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .

“ there are saudi parties that provide financial support to groups that engage in religious propaganda in berlin , ” the chancellor said .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .
the eu 's stability and growth pact says a country must keep its deficits under three percent of gross domestic product or face penalties , including stiff fines .
since paris has not met a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , brussels is considering drawing up detailed budget recommendations .
if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .
they will be discussing a program plan unveiled by romano prodi last week to spend € 220 billion on 29 selected eu programs by 2020 .
consultations will also take place on the plans individual states have devised to inject life into europe 's moribund economy .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it .

nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .
two weeks ago , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet agreed to send up to 450 soldiers to kunduz in an effort to bring stability to the lawless regions outside of kabul and provide extra stability for the government of hamid karzai .
karzai and the united nations have been pleading with the united states and its allies to expand the scope of the peacekeeping mission beyond kabul .
the regions outside the afghan capital are ruled by feuding warlords and provide plenty of cover for dangerous nests of taliban and al qaeda fighters .
future troop deployments also considered the united nations said it would look at expanding the u.n. mandate carried by the nato-led international security assistance force in the first week of november .
diplomats said kunduz could prove a testing ground for future expansions to include additional regions .
the 19-member nato is reportedly considering seven other regions where soldiers could be stationed . germany needs both the nato and u.n. approval before the bundestag can discuss dispatching additional troops to afghanistan .
germany makes up the lion 's share of the 5,500 isaf force in kabul at the moment .
schröder and his defense minister , peter struck , have been eager to emphasize germany 's commitment to the war-torn country .
struck sent a reconnaissance team at the end of september to examine the possibility of sending soldiers to kunduz , and they returned with approval . struck wanted nato and u.n. approval as soon as possible so that german soldiers could start heading to kunduz before the fierce winter begins .
the contingent will be increased to 250 soldiers by may , with the possibility of expanding to 450 .

nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .
two weeks ago , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet agreed to send up to 450 soldiers to kunduz in an effort to bring stability to the lawless regions outside of kabul and provide extra stability for the government of hamid karzai .
karzai and the united nations have been pleading with the united states and its allies to expand the scope of the peacekeeping mission beyond kabul .
the regions outside the afghan capital are ruled by feuding warlords and provide plenty of cover for dangerous nests of taliban and al qaeda fighters .
future troop deployments also considered the united nations said it would look at expanding the u.n. mandate carried by the nato-led international security assistance force in the first week of november .

the 19-member nato is reportedly considering seven other regions where soldiers could be stationed . germany needs both the nato and u.n. approval before the bundestag can discuss dispatching additional troops to afghanistan .
germany makes up the lion 's share of the 5,500 isaf force in kabul at the moment .
schröder and his defense minister , peter struck , have been eager to emphasize germany 's commitment to the war-torn country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.10.2003 germany stuns u.s. , heads to women 's world cup final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's celebration time following the final whistle in their semifinal match with the u.s. germany faces sweden in the women 's world cup final after beating the favored u.s. squad 3-0 on sunday .
with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .

nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .
germany , waiting on u.n. approval , is ready to send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz as soon as this winter . with a few words of caution from france and the united states , nato on monday agreed to expand its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the decision means germany , the current head of the peacekeeping mission , will most likely send soldiers to the northern city of kunduz .
two weeks ago , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet agreed to send up to 450 soldiers to kunduz in an effort to bring stability to the lawless regions outside of kabul and provide extra stability for the government of hamid karzai .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.10.2003 germany stuns u.s. , heads to women 's world cup final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's celebration time following the final whistle in their semifinal match with the u.s. germany faces sweden in the women 's world cup final after beating the favored u.s. squad 3-0 on sunday .
with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it .

with at least a second place spot guaranteed , the german women have established themselves on the global stage . with a stunning 3-0 victory over world cup champs the united states , germany swept into the women 's world cup soccer final and ensured at least the same title that their male counterparts achieved last year . the german team 's victory before a sell-out crowd in portland , oregon marked their first foray into the world cup final since 1995 , when they lost to norway 2-0 .
the men 's national team finished second in the last world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 after losing to brazil 2-0 in the final . the win against the favored united states , defending world cup champions from 1999 , means germany will face sweden - who beat canada 2-1 - in the other semi-final " i 'm happy that we 're considered the favorites after this success , " said german coach tina theune-meyer , looking ahead to a game that will be a rematch of the european championship two years ago .
" we have a lot of self-confidence and we 'll have a good chance against sweden . " german keeper dominates germany 's fluid passing game combined with hard-knuckled goalkeeping by player of the game silke rottenberg proved too much for the americans . after an unconvincing start from both teams , the germans struck in the 15th minute when 6-foot kerstin garefrekes rose up above u.s. captain julie foudy and headed a corner kick past goalkeeper briana scurry . though the americans seemed to wake up after the goal , charging again and again for the rest of the half , they were frustrated by rottenberg 's stops and timing in coming out of the goalie box .
when u.s. star mia hamm broke ahead of two defenders following a perfect pass in the 34th minute , rottenberg charged out to meet her , disrupting hamm and sending her to the turf . " she was overwhelming and kept us from equalizing , " u.s. coach april heinrichs said of the german goalkeeper . the second half saw more aggressiveness from the u.s. team , but without results .
the germans added two goals by maren meinert and birgit prinz in extra time following the 90th minute .
prinz 's goal was her seventh of the cup and ensured her the scorer 's title .
" i think our whole team was very disciplined , " theune-meyer , the german coach , said .
" we played without fault . "
a powerhouse is born that discipline collapsed only after the final whistle blew and the german team ran into each other 's arms on the field .
" i ca n't believe it , i 'm floating on cloud nine , " said meinert .
following five european championships , germany established itself as a global powerhouse in this world cup , which was moved from china to the united states this summer after the sars virus scare . theune-meyer 's team stormed through the top of their group with the maximum points and then dispatched russia in the quarterfinal 7-1 .
though still second-tier to men 's soccer in germany , the number of women picking up the sport has increased and now numbers more than 841,000 , according to germany 's soccer body , the dfb .
the national team 's success can be attributed to an active women 's league as well as the blooming of german players in the highly-competitive wusa .
but the wusa disbanded shortly before the world cup started last week , and organizers hoping a u.s. victory would encourage sponsors to bring the league back together were left disappointed . the disappointment wo n't match that of hamm , julie foudy and kristine lilly , household names in american soccer who left the field in tears after playing their last world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany advances in the other world cup the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .

finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels . the series of high-level eu finance powwows taking place this week starts off with a meeting on monday between the french and german finance ministers in the german town of trier .
high on the agenda of francis mer and hans eichel is how to face their other eu colleagues , many of whom will be chastising the two heavyweights in the upcoming days for their countries ' ballooning deficits and flouting of eu budget rules .
eichel and mer travel to luxembourg monday evening for a meeting of 12 members of the euro zone .
france especially looks set to take some heat for its multi-year deficit busting and refusal to tell brussels how it plans to solve the problem .
france is forecasting a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , after running an expected 4.0 percent this year and breaking eu deficit rules in 2002 .

if it does , it would be the furthest brussels has gone in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to three billion euros under terms of the stability pact germany may be next on brussels ' list of deficit violaters , since it is also set to breach the budget rules this year .
the german government had forecast a deficit of 3.8 percent , but on sunday , finance minister eichel said that number could go higher .
germany has thus far managed to stay in the eu 's good graces only because it has assured brussels that its 2004 budget will keep deficit levels under the three percent mark .
many analysts have called that predication overly optimistic .
mixed opinion on the rules despite the hot seat france finds itself in , it can count on the support of those who say the stability pact has become a straightjacket for countries and denies them the spending flexibility they need to spur economic growth .
" there is the pact .
there is the absolute necessity to reduce the deficit , but there is also the necessity , no less absolute , of growth , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who has said he is " rather against " imposing sanctions on france .
but there are plenty of voices who do not like the idea of two of the euro zone 's biggest economies breaking the rules repeatedly .
karl-heinz grasser , austria 's finance minister , told reporters that the stability pact could lose credibility if it were repeatedly flouted without consequences .
" what france is doing is simply a provocation towards all other euro zone countries , " he told reporters on friday .
" we must stand ready to initiate serious sanctions if france does n't give in , " the netherlands is also expected to come out in favor of sticking to the letter of the law , especially since the dutch government slashed government spending in the midst of a recession to keep its deficit under the three percent mark .
planning for growth when the foreign ministers come together on tuesday for the ecofin conference , which includes all 15 eu countries , strategies to spur badly needed growth will likely top the agenda .

germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition . top members of german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- announced a special summit next week to work towards agreement over controversial reform proposals causing deep rifts within the party . " there are a few points that we can smooth over that we need to talk over and that can be formulated more sensibly , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said in berlin on monday . the conciliatory tone from the spd leadership is in sharp contrast to the hot war of words that broke out last month after six rebel left-wing backbenchers voted against the chancellor ’ s crucial health reforms , nearly robbing the government of its so-called " chancellor " majority .
schröder then decided to link his political fate explicitly to his planned package of welfare and economic reforms , saying that the future and success of the government would be measured by whether it managed to revamp the country ’ s bloated welfare system and ailing economy . that threat seems to be working with some of the spd rebels – who accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots with reforms that will trim the generous welfare state and scale back pensions .
a few appear to be now grudgingly falling into line to save the chancellor ’ s package of reforms he has named " agenda 2010 " . one of the rebels , spd parliamentary member , rüdiger veit indicated in a television interview on tuesday that the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens might yet be able to pass the painful reforms .
" i believe we ’ re on the way to a good compromise on the issue , " he said . important october vote with the clock ticking on towards a key october 17 vote on labor market reforms , the spd appears to have decided to use both sticks and carrots to get the rebel mps to toe the government ’ s line . spd parliamentarian klaus brander told german daily berliner zeitung that the party was considering the idea of changing the proposed legislation to creating better conditions for the elderly unemployed , so that people over 55 didn ’ t have to dig into their pensions savings .
left-wingers are particularly incensed over labor reform proposals that include loosening strict laws on employee protection and collapsing unemployment money and welfare benefits . however , spd secretary general olaf scholz was upbeat after a harmonious board meeting on monday , which saw several spd rebels signalling cooperation with the government over the planned reforms .
" i have a feeling that we ’ ll manage a majority in parliament , " he said . but even as the spd might be on the verge of re-establishing some semblance of party discipline , the conservative opposition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian allies christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- are seeing growing concerns over their own reform agenda .
the conservatives control the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , will need to approve most of schröder ’ s reforms . a neo-liberal cdu ? on monday , angela merkel , leader of the cdu approved controversial reform proposals made by the opposition-appointed herzog committee , headed by former cdu president roman herzog , which recommend decoupling health and nursing premiums from people ’ s earnings and levying a lump sum across the board instead among other things .
merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " and said it presented a " most important switch for christian democratic politics . " the move however has come under fire from left-wing in the cdu .
deputy leader norbert blüm , a former labor minister under chancellor helmut kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook .
blüm warned on monday that the herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most german voters . cdu man hermann-josef arentz announced he ’ ll fight the suggestions tooth and nail .
" the bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , " arentz said .
" the herzog committee itself reckons that about 40 billion euros in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so-well-off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced and just ...
do you really believe that such a big sum will eventually be spent on making a social scheme look more balanced ? " even as the two main parties still wrangle over the final form of the much-needed reform plans , several social organizations in germany have begun threatened large-scale protests including lodging a legal complaint with the courts if the government continues to defer raising pension payments . walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk group , which represents senior citizens , said the ruling parties would be punished at the next polls if they failed to ensure pensioners got their rightful raise .
" the pensioners will not forgive those politically responsible , " he told the berliner zeitung . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder links " political fate " to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .

belgium ’ s royal museum for central africa has been criticized for glorifying its colonial past and portraying africa in a false light .
that may change if the director pushes through plans for a total revamp . belgium ’ s popular royal museum for central africa , located on the outskirts of brussels , boasts extensive displays of carved wooden masks , stuffed animals , musical instruments and souvenirs as well as a glimpse into africa ’ s diverse flora and fauna .
but for present day belgians looking for a critical view on their country ’ s 80-year rule of what novelist joseph conrad called the " heart of darkness , " this is obviously the wrong place .
a large gold statue adorning the royal museum ’ s domed marble foyer bears an engraved plaque with the words , " belgium brings civilization to the congo " .
the inscription encapsulates more than anything else the image that has come to symbolize congo for many belgians – a primitive , undeveloped african backwater pushed towards modernity with roads , hospitals and railway lines provided by a generous government in brussels who took over the free congo state from belgium 's king leopold ii in 1908 .
lopsided presentation of history it ’ s these outdated ideas that guido gryseels , the royal museum ’ s director , believes are the reasons time seems to have stood still in this museum since being built in 1898 by leopold ii .
the king inaugurated the museum following a exposition celebrating leopold ’ s rule over the vast african territory and his commercial exploitation of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda .
even today among the museum 's colorful exhibits , there is no mention of congo ’ s independence from belgium in 1960 , the painful birth of the present day democratic republic of congo , or the genocidal horror in rwanda -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the museum presented the story that the white men went to the congo to civilize the society there and that the congolese were a wild horde that rampaged through the region with spears and shields and needed to be civilized , " gryseels told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s how we imagined it and therefore we admired the missionaries and officials who went there to work .
of course that was a very one-sided perception . "
correcting a historical distortion gryseels first visited the royal museum for central africa as a seven year old , when congo was still a belgian colony .
but it was only during postgraduate studies in australia that he first came into direct contact with africans , learned about them first hand and befriended them .
the experience was to leave a lasting mark .
gryseels now wants to set the historical record on belgium ’ s colonial past straight in a major exhibition set to open in 2005 .
leopold ’ s ii africa temple , which presents the conquest of congo in the 19th century as a heroic battle of the belgians against arabic slave-traders , is slated to undergo a rehaul both in terms of content and design by 2010 , with an international commission overseeing the transformation .
gryseels ' project faces resistance but not everyone is comfortable with gryseels ’ planned project and his attempt at a revised interpretation of history .
" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

" every time i give an interview such as this one , i receive 20 letters a day from people who worked in the colonial era , " gryseels said .
" they tell me : ‘ for heaven ’ s sake – how dare you criticize the colonial period !
we toiled away for several years and often under difficult conditions .
and the congo was in a much better condition in 1960 than it is in today ’ . "
maurice lenain , who worked as chief administrator in congo ’ s northeast province from 1945 to 1960 , still defends the policies of leopold ii , whose spirit pervades the museum .
" belgium took over congo in 1908 .
at the time there were 300 kilometers of railway lines .
when we left the country in 1960 , there were 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers of them .
150,000 kilometers of road were built , there were 30,000 hospitals – in a country where there wasn ’ t a single one 80 years ago , " he told deutsche welle .
" the belgian colonial officials shouldn ’ t be ashamed of what they did in congo .
the millions who are supposed to have died – didn ’ t exist , " he added .
tangible signs of change in belgium there are signs that belgium may finally be prepared to come to grips with its past .
last year author adam hochschild released the book king leopold ’ s ghost , which portrayed leopold ii as a rapacious ruler who plundered congo ’ s natural resources and treated it as his private fiefdom .
he wrote that about ten million congolese perished under his rule .
belgian society was stunned .
in february last year , the belgian government also admitted its role in the 1961 assassination of patrick lumumba , independent congo ’ s first prime minister and offered a belated apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium drops war crimes cases belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .

the singing legend said he plans to pass on his experience to pupils for free , and give something back to the music world .
" i received a beautiful welcome to the world of music , " said the tenor who was speaking as he launched his first pop album after a 40-year career in classical opera .
" i want to give something back to the younger generation . "
pavarotti said he was looking forward to a new challenge .
" teaching i think is the most difficult thing ; teaching is more difficult than singing .

" i want to teach people who really are good , " he added .
difficult year pavarotti was a teacher before he found fame in the opera world in the 1960s .
he said he expected to teach mostly in his native country italy and in new york where he spends much of his time .

first proposed in may 2000 , plans for the £ 20m laboratory in cambridge are still awaiting approval from the office of the deputy prime minister , john prescott .
on tuesday academics will discuss a report which alleged university authorities did not give the complete picture when the plans were first put before the university 's own governing body , the regent house .
the report by the board of scrutiny , the university 's official watchdog , claims the extent of animal experiments at the site was kept hidden .
as a result it says , the regent house passed the plan without knowing the true nature of it .
chairman of the board of scrutiny , professor john spencer , said : " we certainly do n't think this was a proper thing to have done . "
' outrageous and immoral ' gillian evans , professor of medieval theology at the university and member of the regent house , described the move as " outrageous and immoral " .
she said : " to find that we are being expected to approve something without knowing the real details is very frightening . "
south cambridgeshire district council has twice refused permission for the facility and the university appealed against the decision .
while senior academics debate the plans on tuesday at the senate house , the animal activist organisation animal aid , has called for a demonstration .
the planned laboratory provoked uproar among anti-vivisectionists for its proposed use of marmosets and macaque monkeys .
scientists insist the experiments are crucial for researching incurable diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's .

the company said profits for the six months to late august came in at £ 41.2m -lrb- $ 66m -rrb- , down from £ 53.6m during the same period last year , and below most analysts ' forecasts .
revenues also suffered , with like-for-like retail sales - which strip out the impact of new store openings - falling by 6.7 % on the year .
the firm blamed its weaker half-year performance on stocking strategies which reduced the choice available to its customers .
it also cited gaps in its range of classic ladieswear .
matalan group chairman john hargreaves described the figures as " disappointing , " and said the company had taken steps to deliver better results in the autumn / winter season .
autumn recovery ?

china 's policy of keeping the yuan pegged at roughly 8.28 to the us dollar was " based on market demand and supply and is in line with china 's reality , " he said .
it showed " a high sense of responsibility towards the international community , " he added , speaking in bali ahead of a summit of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
china has come under increasing pressure from the united states and other developed countries to let the yuan appreciate , or take the more drastic step of allowing it to float freely .
wary of concessions us lawmakers , industrialists and labour unions argue that china 's fixed exchange rate undervalues the currency , unfairly cheapens its exports and destroys us jobs .
us treasury secretary john snow called on china to widen the yuan 's trading band , thus allowing it to strengthen against the dollar , during a recent visit to china .
the us national association of manufacturers is pushing for the us to file a complaint of unfair trade practices against china at the world trade organisation .
china 's central bank governor answered critics at the g7 summit of industrial nations last month by saying he was willing to consider gradually adjusting the yuan exchange rate , but gave no timescale .
mr wen chose a less conciliatory stance .
" to keep the renminbi -lrb- yuan -rrb- stable at an appropriate and balanced level is conducive to the economic stability not only of china but also of the region and the world at large , " he said .
mr wen said china would seek an " appropriate " exchange rate " in the course of further economic reform " .
chinese regulators are worried that the banking system is not strong enough to cope with sudden adjustments to the exchange rate .
mr wen pointed out that china 's exports amount to 5 % of the world 's total .

ruling out privatisation , the government has now set suggested dates when consumers might expect a bill for their water and sewerage services .
the charges are expected to begin in april 2006 .
the cost of running the water service , a government agency , is paid for out of the annual budget from westminster .
water rates are expected to be introduced in 2006 part of this cost used to come directly from the domestic rating system , but that link was broken a few years ago .
as a result , water and sewage services in northern ireland currently cost consumers a lot less than in the rest of the uk .
they pay on average £ 473 a year for their rates while scottish consumers pay £ 1300 for their water and property tax .
the treasury has now signalled that similar charges must be brought into northern ireland .
however , regional development minister john spellar has agreed that there will be no privatisation and no flat-rate charges .
instead , some form of government company or corporation will be formed to run the new , thinned-down service and the bills will be some form of hybrid with a standing charge plus a top-up charge to reflect to property value .
metering of supplies has also been ruled out in the short .
apart from the many years it would take to fit water meters in 700,000 homes , it is estimated the cost would be extremely high , running up to as much as £ 120m .
the introduction of domestic water charges was never going to be a popular policy john spellar regional development minister while the changes would bring northern ireland into line with the rest of the uk , the main reason is to raise some of the £ 3bn required over 20 years to bring the water and sewerage system up to date .
more than one third of all sewage treatment plants fall below european standards , with many of them simply pumping raw sewage into the sea .
the investment to replace them will have to be raised from the consumer .
mr spellar said he recognised water reform presented many difficult issues .
" the introduction of domestic water charges was never going to be a popular policy , " he said .
" however , arguing , that ' the treasury should pay ' would mean that we would be asking taxpayers in great britain to pay more when we are already paying much less than they do in council tax and water charges . "
the minister 's announcement confirms that it is only a question of how charges are introduced and what the initial level will be bumper graham water service trade unions secretary the imminent arrival of water charges has angered a lot of people , including some trade unions .
the water service is facing a cut in staff to make it more efficient , which has gone down badly with its unions .
their secretary , bumper graham , has described the latest report as a " cop-out " .
he said the public consultation process on the water service 's future had showed an " overwhelming " rejection of water charges .
" the minister 's announcement confirms that it is only a question of how charges are introduced and what the initial level will be , " said mr graham .
" furthermore , he has confirmed his intention to dismantle the water service and in doing so destroy hundreds of our members ' jobs . "
possible jail penalties over the last year or so , the european commission has been making warning noises over poor water treatment standards in northern ireland .
however , if the service is turned into a government company , it will lose it crown immunity from prosecution .
rather than have to just worry about the european commission , the directors could also find themselves in the high court for pollution in rivers as well as failure to meet to compulsory standards .
one of the penalties they could face is jail .
this is hardly an invitation to attract industry leaders .

ruling out privatisation , the government has now set suggested dates when consumers might expect a bill for their water and sewerage services .
the charges are expected to begin in april 2006 .
the cost of running the water service , a government agency , is paid for out of the annual budget from westminster .
water rates are expected to be introduced in 2006 part of this cost used to come directly from the domestic rating system , but that link was broken a few years ago .
as a result , water and sewage services in northern ireland currently cost consumers a lot less than in the rest of the uk .
they pay on average £ 473 a year for their rates while scottish consumers pay £ 1300 for their water and property tax .
the treasury has now signalled that similar charges must be brought into northern ireland .
however , regional development minister john spellar has agreed that there will be no privatisation and no flat-rate charges .
instead , some form of government company or corporation will be formed to run the new , thinned-down service and the bills will be some form of hybrid with a standing charge plus a top-up charge to reflect to property value .
metering of supplies has also been ruled out in the short .
apart from the many years it would take to fit water meters in 700,000 homes , it is estimated the cost would be extremely high , running up to as much as £ 120m .
the introduction of domestic water charges was never going to be a popular policy john spellar regional development minister while the changes would bring northern ireland into line with the rest of the uk , the main reason is to raise some of the £ 3bn required over 20 years to bring the water and sewerage system up to date .
more than one third of all sewage treatment plants fall below european standards , with many of them simply pumping raw sewage into the sea .
the investment to replace them will have to be raised from the consumer .
mr spellar said he recognised water reform presented many difficult issues .
" the introduction of domestic water charges was never going to be a popular policy , " he said .
" however , arguing , that ' the treasury should pay ' would mean that we would be asking taxpayers in great britain to pay more when we are already paying much less than they do in council tax and water charges . "
the minister 's announcement confirms that it is only a question of how charges are introduced and what the initial level will be bumper graham water service trade unions secretary the imminent arrival of water charges has angered a lot of people , including some trade unions .
the water service is facing a cut in staff to make it more efficient , which has gone down badly with its unions .
their secretary , bumper graham , has described the latest report as a " cop-out " .
he said the public consultation process on the water service 's future had showed an " overwhelming " rejection of water charges .
" the minister 's announcement confirms that it is only a question of how charges are introduced and what the initial level will be , " said mr graham .
" furthermore , he has confirmed his intention to dismantle the water service and in doing so destroy hundreds of our members ' jobs . "
possible jail penalties over the last year or so , the european commission has been making warning noises over poor water treatment standards in northern ireland .
however , if the service is turned into a government company , it will lose it crown immunity from prosecution .
rather than have to just worry about the european commission , the directors could also find themselves in the high court for pollution in rivers as well as failure to meet to compulsory standards .
one of the penalties they could face is jail .

ruling out privatisation , the government has now set suggested dates when consumers might expect a bill for their water and sewerage services .
the charges are expected to begin in april 2006 .
the cost of running the water service , a government agency , is paid for out of the annual budget from westminster .
water rates are expected to be introduced in 2006 part of this cost used to come directly from the domestic rating system , but that link was broken a few years ago .
as a result , water and sewage services in northern ireland currently cost consumers a lot less than in the rest of the uk .
they pay on average £ 473 a year for their rates while scottish consumers pay £ 1300 for their water and property tax .
the treasury has now signalled that similar charges must be brought into northern ireland .
however , regional development minister john spellar has agreed that there will be no privatisation and no flat-rate charges .
instead , some form of government company or corporation will be formed to run the new , thinned-down service and the bills will be some form of hybrid with a standing charge plus a top-up charge to reflect to property value .
metering of supplies has also been ruled out in the short .
apart from the many years it would take to fit water meters in 700,000 homes , it is estimated the cost would be extremely high , running up to as much as £ 120m .
the introduction of domestic water charges was never going to be a popular policy john spellar regional development minister while the changes would bring northern ireland into line with the rest of the uk , the main reason is to raise some of the £ 3bn required over 20 years to bring the water and sewerage system up to date .
more than one third of all sewage treatment plants fall below european standards , with many of them simply pumping raw sewage into the sea .
the investment to replace them will have to be raised from the consumer .
mr spellar said he recognised water reform presented many difficult issues .
" the introduction of domestic water charges was never going to be a popular policy , " he said .
" however , arguing , that ' the treasury should pay ' would mean that we would be asking taxpayers in great britain to pay more when we are already paying much less than they do in council tax and water charges . "
the minister 's announcement confirms that it is only a question of how charges are introduced and what the initial level will be bumper graham water service trade unions secretary the imminent arrival of water charges has angered a lot of people , including some trade unions .
the water service is facing a cut in staff to make it more efficient , which has gone down badly with its unions .
their secretary , bumper graham , has described the latest report as a " cop-out " .
he said the public consultation process on the water service 's future had showed an " overwhelming " rejection of water charges .
" the minister 's announcement confirms that it is only a question of how charges are introduced and what the initial level will be , " said mr graham .
" furthermore , he has confirmed his intention to dismantle the water service and in doing so destroy hundreds of our members ' jobs . "
possible jail penalties over the last year or so , the european commission has been making warning noises over poor water treatment standards in northern ireland .
however , if the service is turned into a government company , it will lose it crown immunity from prosecution .
rather than have to just worry about the european commission , the directors could also find themselves in the high court for pollution in rivers as well as failure to meet to compulsory standards .
one of the penalties they could face is jail .
this is hardly an invitation to attract industry leaders .

whether you are worried about growing your company without losing control , or agonising over funding for a new business , our panellists can help you .
following a strong response , bbc news online is publishing several sets of answers to your questions .
we have tried to include as many questions as possible .
anita roddick , founder of the body shop , gives the lowdown on using feminine traits in business .
simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer , on how to design an advertising campaign for a restaurant .
david wilkinson , partner at ernst & young , provides insight on alternative ways of sourcing finance .
judith rutherford , head of business link for london , looks at grants for safari parks and leaving a secure job to set up on your own .
peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking , provides help on raising finance in eastern europe and avoiding bad debts .
nigel nicholson , professor , london business school , comments on whether leadership qualities are intrinsic or can be acquired .
david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london , offers help on patenting ideas .
bbc news online will publish its final set of answers from our panel of small business experts on tuesday , 14 october .
question maya wagle , us dame anita - your success has been phenomenal .
my questions are : what was the feminine trait you had to suppress in order to conform to a world driven by men ?
what feminine trait did you find most useful in your journey ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop conformity to me is like a sliver of death , sneaking into your brain and stagnating what keeps you feeling alive .
i conformed not one iota .
i turned the annual report and accounts into a document to delight , i brought a child development centre right smack into the headquarters .
there were love programmes where employees were given a certain sum of money to develop any interest they had -lrb- nothing related to the business -rrb- - the only stipulation was that no one could use the cash for learning golf !
there is a mythology going around that says the way for a woman to succeed is to act like a man , where you have to undergo a metaphorical sex change , be tough talking and express no feelings .
women build alliances , bring people together and most importantly they build intimate , informal networks and their biggest strength is communication .
what feminine traits did i find most useful ?
humour .
it cuts through everything .
return to the top question mark wilkes , uk i and two partners are opening a restaurant in the north-east of england .
our anticipated gross annual turnover is £ 190,000 .
we had initially budgeted for only £ 1,500 in advertising costs in the first year split as follows : leaflet drop / in local papers - £ 250 , university freshers ' packs - £ 400 , radio broadcast - £ 800 .
i have since found out that the radio advertising costs for one week on a well-listened-to station will be around £ 2,000 , including design for six adverts daily .
this would push us above the budget , however the cost is not too prohibitive .
would you recommend only advertising on radio , distributing the finance amongst other advertising mediums , or some other formulation ?
our aim is to attract people from across the spectrum , from professionals to students , and to allocate offers to different days of the week for the different client sectors .
is there a general formula which can be applied to advertising costs based upon expected turnover or profit ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer reading your question , i 'm a little concerned that you are trying to be all things to all people .
by targeting the student market and professionals , you are in danger of alienating both markets , as they require very different things from a restaurant .
it 's likely that you will have a quiet night and you can use a price incentive or value promotion to attract customers - but as soon as you target a group of people in a serious way -lrb- through advertising -rrb- , you are likely to be thought of as a restaurant catering just for that market .
the amount you spend on marketing is dictated by many things - including the amount of competing restaurants in your area , the amount that they advertise , the uniqueness of your restaurant , the profile of your restaurant etc .
there is no fixed formula but in our experience , restaurants spend on average 3-5 % of their turnover on marketing .
this would mean you might need to consider increasing your budget to ensure that consumers are constantly reminded of your restaurant .
do n't forget pr in your marketing mix .
make sure that the local papers and magazines are invited to the opening and keep an element of your menu fluid , so that there is always something to talk to the press about .
i think that advertising for just one week on the radio wo n't be enough to maintain the sort of awareness you need .
it would make a good launch promotion but i am sure that you will need to find a means to advertise the restaurant on a regular basis e.g. in a local newspaper or magazine , to be really effective .
it 's slightly away from your question but i showed your turnover projection to our sales director , samson sohail , who has worked with restaurants of all sizes for 10 years .
he thinks that any restaurant these days needs to be aiming for a minimum turnover of £ 5,000 per month to remain comfortably in business .
return to the top question sucheen patel , uk i have a business idea , which has a large fixed cost to set up , but the potential profits would cover the cost after three or four years .
are there any sources of funding available other than the traditional route of bank lending ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young your ability to raise funding for a new business will depend on a number of factors .
in this situation , banks , which do not have a particularly large margin on lendings and can not therefore afford to accept significant risk , tend to be unwilling to lend without good asset backing as security .
if your business is a new , unproven concept they will be even more reluctant to lend , as they will not be able to get comfortable that you can service the debt .
the government 's loan guarantee scheme can help , but in circumstances where the risk to the funder is high and the return is also potentially high , equity finance may be more appropriate .
other forms of debt for asset purchases , such as hire purchase and leasing , tend to be difficult for start-up businesses .
you should also check out whether there are any grants , whether uk or european , available to you .
this will depend largely on the type and location of your business .
equity funding can come from a variety of sources , including venture capitalists , business angels and friends and family .
your ability to raise venture capital will depend on the quality of the business idea and the management team you have assembled to execute the plan .
you will also find that the scale of your proposed business will have an impact - venture capitalists will only want to invest if they see the opportunity to create a business with significant value .
they therefore tend not to invest below £ 1m and often not much below £ 5m .
further information on venture capitalists can be obtained through the british venture capital association -lrb- bvca -rrb- at : http : / / www.bvca.co.uk below this level , angel investors , who are generally people who have been successful in business and are prepared to invest their time and money in young companies , are a potential source of finance and they are best contacted through one of a variety of angel organisations .
you can find details by contacting the national business angel network on 020 7329 29 29 or at : http : / / www.nationalbusangels.co.uk angel investors were very active during the dotcom boom , but there are fewer now and they tend to be more risk-averse .
many founders of businesses , particularly those starting out at a smaller scale and with little track record , have found that friends and family are one of the few sources available for equity finance .
return to the top question bob findlay , ireland i want to return to the uk and set up a " british " safari park - i.e. re-grow a small forest in the north east of england , where land is cheap and there are few people yet near good transport , and stock it with once british animals such as wolves , bears , wild boar , beaver wild cattle , deer etc .
what grants could i get towards this from the uk government , the eu , and wildlife and environmental organisations ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london what you are proposing is an interesting concept , but you need to go further than this and ensure that you believe there will be sufficient demand for the offer .
in particular , the size of the local catchment area will be key .
in addition , the start-up costs for such a venture would be substantial in order to ensure appropriate safety measures were in place and this should be taken into consideration .
in terms of grants , there are a vast number on offer in the uk , although i am not aware of any that specifically match up to your business idea .
objective two areas -lrb- an eu definition of regions going through the process of economic restructuring -rrb- are a frequent focus of grant funding .
however , they tend to be well-defined zones closer to city centres and conurbations rather than in the countryside and so they might not provide any opportunities .
however the wwf may have a specific initiative that matches well with your idea .
in addition , there are a number of designated rural regeneration zones in the uk and business assistance grants are available in some of these .
it is worth visiting : http : / / www.j4b.co.uk to further explore the grant options available to you .
contacting your local tourist board would also be beneficial .
it could perhaps assist with marketing details and also advise on the opportunities available for turning over land from agricultural to leisure purposes .
question lee head , uk i have toyed with the idea of opening up a cafe-bar for a couple of years now but have never taken it any further .
i am in a secure it job but would love a change .
i need to find information on start-up costs , potential grants available , financial support and projected income .
what 's stopping me is the thought of leaving a secure income of around £ 28k and diving into the great unknown .
if you can point me in the right direction to clarify some of those unknowns and reduce my risk , it could be the start of a new direction for me .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london i can understand that the thought of leaving a secure job unnerves you and quite rightly - starting a business is not a frivolous undertaking and there a number of key steps that must be taken to ensure you are making the right decision .
you need to be sure that you have a commercially viable proposition .
have you researched the market in your area ?
how stiff is the competition ?
is there a gap in the market for what you are thinking of offering ?
you need to be clear on these issues before proceeding any further .
given that you are considering changing your role from employee to owner-manager , you should also reflect on the commitment and work involved in setting up a business - particularly one in the hospitality sector , where 15-hour days are the norm -lrb- not including activities outside trading hours , such as sourcing food and day-to-day operational and management planning -rrb- .
unfortunately , there are no generic answers to the specific questions you ask , since the responses will differ on a case-by-case basis .
i suggest you take further advice in person , either via your local business link , chamber of commerce , an accountant or start-up lending team at your bank .
return to the top question christopher gore , hungary i started a business in hungary in 1991 and over the past 12 years have developed the largest owned network of insurance brokers in central eastern europe .
to date it has been almost impossible to raise small amounts of finance to develop our business in the region .
your advice would be useful .
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you have obviously already established a successful business , but you are right to continue to develop your business further .
in the uk , the two main sources of finance open to you are loan and equity .
i assume you have already investigated loan finance with your banker .
you do not disclose the size of the finance you are seeking , but if appropriate you could consider equity finance , venture capital firms or business angels , who can provide equity finance in return for a share in your company and may also offer personal managerial and entrepreneurial know-how to the business -lrb- as a non-exec director , for example -rrb- .
they may also be able to use their network of contacts to access extra and complimentary sources of finance .
additionally , you may be eligible for grant aid from the government - you should explore this option with your government offices .
question kenneth , uk i am about to start a small business importing plumbing accessories from china .
my products are items like metal casting , ball valve and other plumb fitting accessories widely used by all residential properties .
my target customers are plumbers merchants , wholesalers and plumbing accessories manufacturers .
i can see my biggest business risk is bad debts or non-payment by customers .
it is common practice in this trade to give credits .
since i am a start-up with very little cashflow at the beginning , can you please advise what i can use to help protect against a customer not paying ?
i understand that a purchase order issued by customers is not very useful in the event that i am not getting paid , is that right ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you are not alone in your concerns about late payment .
recent research by natwest shows that late payment of commercial debts is an increasing concern for small businesses .
measures have been introduced in a bid to alleviate the problem : the late payment of commercial debt -lrb- interest -rrb- act 1998 enables small businesses to claim statutory interest for late payment of commercial debts .
it includes the right to claim reasonable debt recovery costs , the right to challenge grossly unfair contractual terms that undermine the purpose of the legislation and the right for small- and medium-sized enterprises to ask a representative body to challenge unfair terms on their behalf .
there are measures that you can put in place yourself that may help you in minimising the risk of late payment , for example , ensuring that your payment terms are clearly stated on all documentation so that there can be no misunderstandings between you and your customer .
you could also consider offering a discount for early payment .
once your business is established , you could consider invoice financing which will offer you a way of off-setting some of the problems caused by late payment .
you will find useful information on the procedures for the importing of goods on the hm customs and excise website : http : / / www.hmce.gov.uk return to the top question ian black , uk in his latest book , john adair still maintains that one can " learn to lead " .
as a management lecturer , i think i can teach people to adopt a management approach , with hints of leadership , but if that leadership spark is not there then they will not be able to adjust what is really a basic personality trait .
any thoughts ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school i share your perspective , but let me qualify that a little .
the most important trait for a leader is wanting to lead - by which i mean a genuine desire to be accountable , to be responsible for people and their work , plus the qualities of character that enable the individual to weather storms with good humour and adaptability .
i also think that lots of people do n't realise what good leaders they might be if they were to step up to the plate .
confidence is important , but it does grow and should n't be a pre-requisite .
on the other side there are lots of people who do n't have any interest in being leaders because they know they would dislike it and find it stressful .
they should be left in peace , and i strongly resist any philosophy that makes them feel they ought to want to be leaders .
where i think " leadership " is universal , is that everyone in an organisation , at any position , should take responsibility for the people around them and take initiatives to help others , wherever they can see an opportunity to play a constructive role in the difficult issues to do with tasks and people that we all face .
keep teaching people and see what emerges !
return to the top question timo , england if i have an idea , but think the idea is already being used elsewhere in the world , how do i check the idea is patented , and can i still produce the idea over here if there is no patent in the uk ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you can check whether your idea has already been patented by visiting the patent office 's website : http : / / www.patent.gov.uk which holds details on more than 30 million worldwide patents .
if no one has already done so , then you may apply for a patent by filing a description and relevant drawings with the patent office .
to be patentable , your invention must be new , involve an innovative step , be capable of industrial application and not be on the patent office 's excluded list .
beware !
obtaining a full patent is a long and complex process .
although the initial application for a uk patent is free , obtaining a full grant will cost a few hundred pounds in fees - many times more if you require the expertise of a registered patent agent or are looking to market your invention abroad .
remember that patents are territorial rights so a uk patent will only give the holder rights within the uk and rights to stop others importing the product into the uk .
question mr n singh , england i am thinking of becoming a sole trader but all the information that i have been able to gather so far is very complicated to understand .
what do i need to do to start the business ?
who do i have to inform and when ?
what level of earnings can i earn before paying tax ?
do i have to pay national insurance contributions ?
do i need to employ an accountant ?
when will the vat be applicable - as in year one i will not know what my earnings will be and will not be charging vat to my customers ?
will i need to make my own arrangements for pension requirements ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you should consult my recent article on bbc news online : how to beat red tape which answers most of your questions .
you are not legally obliged to employ an accountant , although you may find it easier to do so when it comes to filling in your tax return .
you will need to make your own pension arrangements , which may take the form of additional voluntary national insurance contributions , a stakeholder pension or some other personal pension plan .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .

question maya wagle , us dame anita - your success has been phenomenal .
my questions are : what was the feminine trait you had to suppress in order to conform to a world driven by men ?
what feminine trait did you find most useful in your journey ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop conformity to me is like a sliver of death , sneaking into your brain and stagnating what keeps you feeling alive .
i conformed not one iota .
i turned the annual report and accounts into a document to delight , i brought a child development centre right smack into the headquarters .
there were love programmes where employees were given a certain sum of money to develop any interest they had -lrb- nothing related to the business -rrb- - the only stipulation was that no one could use the cash for learning golf !
there is a mythology going around that says the way for a woman to succeed is to act like a man , where you have to undergo a metaphorical sex change , be tough talking and express no feelings .
women build alliances , bring people together and most importantly they build intimate , informal networks and their biggest strength is communication .
what feminine traits did i find most useful ?
humour .
it cuts through everything .
return to the top question mark wilkes , uk i and two partners are opening a restaurant in the north-east of england .
our anticipated gross annual turnover is £ 190,000 .
we had initially budgeted for only £ 1,500 in advertising costs in the first year split as follows : leaflet drop / in local papers - £ 250 , university freshers ' packs - £ 400 , radio broadcast - £ 800 .
i have since found out that the radio advertising costs for one week on a well-listened-to station will be around £ 2,000 , including design for six adverts daily .
this would push us above the budget , however the cost is not too prohibitive .
would you recommend only advertising on radio , distributing the finance amongst other advertising mediums , or some other formulation ?
our aim is to attract people from across the spectrum , from professionals to students , and to allocate offers to different days of the week for the different client sectors .
is there a general formula which can be applied to advertising costs based upon expected turnover or profit ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer reading your question , i 'm a little concerned that you are trying to be all things to all people .
by targeting the student market and professionals , you are in danger of alienating both markets , as they require very different things from a restaurant .
it 's likely that you will have a quiet night and you can use a price incentive or value promotion to attract customers - but as soon as you target a group of people in a serious way -lrb- through advertising -rrb- , you are likely to be thought of as a restaurant catering just for that market .
the amount you spend on marketing is dictated by many things - including the amount of competing restaurants in your area , the amount that they advertise , the uniqueness of your restaurant , the profile of your restaurant etc .
there is no fixed formula but in our experience , restaurants spend on average 3-5 % of their turnover on marketing .
this would mean you might need to consider increasing your budget to ensure that consumers are constantly reminded of your restaurant .
do n't forget pr in your marketing mix .
make sure that the local papers and magazines are invited to the opening and keep an element of your menu fluid , so that there is always something to talk to the press about .
i think that advertising for just one week on the radio wo n't be enough to maintain the sort of awareness you need .
it would make a good launch promotion but i am sure that you will need to find a means to advertise the restaurant on a regular basis e.g. in a local newspaper or magazine , to be really effective .
it 's slightly away from your question but i showed your turnover projection to our sales director , samson sohail , who has worked with restaurants of all sizes for 10 years .
he thinks that any restaurant these days needs to be aiming for a minimum turnover of £ 5,000 per month to remain comfortably in business .
return to the top question sucheen patel , uk i have a business idea , which has a large fixed cost to set up , but the potential profits would cover the cost after three or four years .
are there any sources of funding available other than the traditional route of bank lending ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young your ability to raise funding for a new business will depend on a number of factors .
in this situation , banks , which do not have a particularly large margin on lendings and can not therefore afford to accept significant risk , tend to be unwilling to lend without good asset backing as security .
if your business is a new , unproven concept they will be even more reluctant to lend , as they will not be able to get comfortable that you can service the debt .
the government 's loan guarantee scheme can help , but in circumstances where the risk to the funder is high and the return is also potentially high , equity finance may be more appropriate .
other forms of debt for asset purchases , such as hire purchase and leasing , tend to be difficult for start-up businesses .
you should also check out whether there are any grants , whether uk or european , available to you .
this will depend largely on the type and location of your business .
equity funding can come from a variety of sources , including venture capitalists , business angels and friends and family .
your ability to raise venture capital will depend on the quality of the business idea and the management team you have assembled to execute the plan .
you will also find that the scale of your proposed business will have an impact - venture capitalists will only want to invest if they see the opportunity to create a business with significant value .
they therefore tend not to invest below £ 1m and often not much below £ 5m .
further information on venture capitalists can be obtained through the british venture capital association -lrb- bvca -rrb- at : http : / / www.bvca.co.uk below this level , angel investors , who are generally people who have been successful in business and are prepared to invest their time and money in young companies , are a potential source of finance and they are best contacted through one of a variety of angel organisations .
you can find details by contacting the national business angel network on 020 7329 29 29 or at : http : / / www.nationalbusangels.co.uk angel investors were very active during the dotcom boom , but there are fewer now and they tend to be more risk-averse .
many founders of businesses , particularly those starting out at a smaller scale and with little track record , have found that friends and family are one of the few sources available for equity finance .
return to the top question bob findlay , ireland i want to return to the uk and set up a " british " safari park - i.e. re-grow a small forest in the north east of england , where land is cheap and there are few people yet near good transport , and stock it with once british animals such as wolves , bears , wild boar , beaver wild cattle , deer etc .
what grants could i get towards this from the uk government , the eu , and wildlife and environmental organisations ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london what you are proposing is an interesting concept , but you need to go further than this and ensure that you believe there will be sufficient demand for the offer .
in particular , the size of the local catchment area will be key .
in addition , the start-up costs for such a venture would be substantial in order to ensure appropriate safety measures were in place and this should be taken into consideration .
in terms of grants , there are a vast number on offer in the uk , although i am not aware of any that specifically match up to your business idea .
objective two areas -lrb- an eu definition of regions going through the process of economic restructuring -rrb- are a frequent focus of grant funding .
however , they tend to be well-defined zones closer to city centres and conurbations rather than in the countryside and so they might not provide any opportunities .
however the wwf may have a specific initiative that matches well with your idea .
in addition , there are a number of designated rural regeneration zones in the uk and business assistance grants are available in some of these .
it is worth visiting : http : / / www.j4b.co.uk to further explore the grant options available to you .
contacting your local tourist board would also be beneficial .
it could perhaps assist with marketing details and also advise on the opportunities available for turning over land from agricultural to leisure purposes .
question lee head , uk i have toyed with the idea of opening up a cafe-bar for a couple of years now but have never taken it any further .
i am in a secure it job but would love a change .
i need to find information on start-up costs , potential grants available , financial support and projected income .
what 's stopping me is the thought of leaving a secure income of around £ 28k and diving into the great unknown .
if you can point me in the right direction to clarify some of those unknowns and reduce my risk , it could be the start of a new direction for me .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london i can understand that the thought of leaving a secure job unnerves you and quite rightly - starting a business is not a frivolous undertaking and there a number of key steps that must be taken to ensure you are making the right decision .
you need to be sure that you have a commercially viable proposition .
have you researched the market in your area ?
how stiff is the competition ?
is there a gap in the market for what you are thinking of offering ?
you need to be clear on these issues before proceeding any further .
given that you are considering changing your role from employee to owner-manager , you should also reflect on the commitment and work involved in setting up a business - particularly one in the hospitality sector , where 15-hour days are the norm -lrb- not including activities outside trading hours , such as sourcing food and day-to-day operational and management planning -rrb- .
unfortunately , there are no generic answers to the specific questions you ask , since the responses will differ on a case-by-case basis .
i suggest you take further advice in person , either via your local business link , chamber of commerce , an accountant or start-up lending team at your bank .
return to the top question christopher gore , hungary i started a business in hungary in 1991 and over the past 12 years have developed the largest owned network of insurance brokers in central eastern europe .
to date it has been almost impossible to raise small amounts of finance to develop our business in the region .
your advice would be useful .
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you have obviously already established a successful business , but you are right to continue to develop your business further .
in the uk , the two main sources of finance open to you are loan and equity .
i assume you have already investigated loan finance with your banker .
you do not disclose the size of the finance you are seeking , but if appropriate you could consider equity finance , venture capital firms or business angels , who can provide equity finance in return for a share in your company and may also offer personal managerial and entrepreneurial know-how to the business -lrb- as a non-exec director , for example -rrb- .
they may also be able to use their network of contacts to access extra and complimentary sources of finance .
additionally , you may be eligible for grant aid from the government - you should explore this option with your government offices .
question kenneth , uk i am about to start a small business importing plumbing accessories from china .
my products are items like metal casting , ball valve and other plumb fitting accessories widely used by all residential properties .
my target customers are plumbers merchants , wholesalers and plumbing accessories manufacturers .
i can see my biggest business risk is bad debts or non-payment by customers .
it is common practice in this trade to give credits .
since i am a start-up with very little cashflow at the beginning , can you please advise what i can use to help protect against a customer not paying ?
i understand that a purchase order issued by customers is not very useful in the event that i am not getting paid , is that right ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you are not alone in your concerns about late payment .
recent research by natwest shows that late payment of commercial debts is an increasing concern for small businesses .
measures have been introduced in a bid to alleviate the problem : the late payment of commercial debt -lrb- interest -rrb- act 1998 enables small businesses to claim statutory interest for late payment of commercial debts .
it includes the right to claim reasonable debt recovery costs , the right to challenge grossly unfair contractual terms that undermine the purpose of the legislation and the right for small- and medium-sized enterprises to ask a representative body to challenge unfair terms on their behalf .
there are measures that you can put in place yourself that may help you in minimising the risk of late payment , for example , ensuring that your payment terms are clearly stated on all documentation so that there can be no misunderstandings between you and your customer .
you could also consider offering a discount for early payment .
once your business is established , you could consider invoice financing which will offer you a way of off-setting some of the problems caused by late payment .
you will find useful information on the procedures for the importing of goods on the hm customs and excise website : http : / / www.hmce.gov.uk return to the top question ian black , uk in his latest book , john adair still maintains that one can " learn to lead " .
as a management lecturer , i think i can teach people to adopt a management approach , with hints of leadership , but if that leadership spark is not there then they will not be able to adjust what is really a basic personality trait .
any thoughts ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school i share your perspective , but let me qualify that a little .
the most important trait for a leader is wanting to lead - by which i mean a genuine desire to be accountable , to be responsible for people and their work , plus the qualities of character that enable the individual to weather storms with good humour and adaptability .
i also think that lots of people do n't realise what good leaders they might be if they were to step up to the plate .
confidence is important , but it does grow and should n't be a pre-requisite .
on the other side there are lots of people who do n't have any interest in being leaders because they know they would dislike it and find it stressful .
they should be left in peace , and i strongly resist any philosophy that makes them feel they ought to want to be leaders .
where i think " leadership " is universal , is that everyone in an organisation , at any position , should take responsibility for the people around them and take initiatives to help others , wherever they can see an opportunity to play a constructive role in the difficult issues to do with tasks and people that we all face .
keep teaching people and see what emerges !
return to the top question timo , england if i have an idea , but think the idea is already being used elsewhere in the world , how do i check the idea is patented , and can i still produce the idea over here if there is no patent in the uk ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you can check whether your idea has already been patented by visiting the patent office 's website : http : / / www.patent.gov.uk which holds details on more than 30 million worldwide patents .
if no one has already done so , then you may apply for a patent by filing a description and relevant drawings with the patent office .
to be patentable , your invention must be new , involve an innovative step , be capable of industrial application and not be on the patent office 's excluded list .
beware !
obtaining a full patent is a long and complex process .
although the initial application for a uk patent is free , obtaining a full grant will cost a few hundred pounds in fees - many times more if you require the expertise of a registered patent agent or are looking to market your invention abroad .
remember that patents are territorial rights so a uk patent will only give the holder rights within the uk and rights to stop others importing the product into the uk .
question mr n singh , england i am thinking of becoming a sole trader but all the information that i have been able to gather so far is very complicated to understand .
what do i need to do to start the business ?
who do i have to inform and when ?
what level of earnings can i earn before paying tax ?
do i have to pay national insurance contributions ?
do i need to employ an accountant ?
when will the vat be applicable - as in year one i will not know what my earnings will be and will not be charging vat to my customers ?
will i need to make my own arrangements for pension requirements ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you should consult my recent article on bbc news online : how to beat red tape which answers most of your questions .
you are not legally obliged to employ an accountant , although you may find it easier to do so when it comes to filling in your tax return .
you will need to make your own pension arrangements , which may take the form of additional voluntary national insurance contributions , a stakeholder pension or some other personal pension plan .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

since i am a start-up with very little cashflow at the beginning , can you please advise what i can use to help protect against a customer not paying ?
i understand that a purchase order issued by customers is not very useful in the event that i am not getting paid , is that right ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you are not alone in your concerns about late payment .
recent research by natwest shows that late payment of commercial debts is an increasing concern for small businesses .
measures have been introduced in a bid to alleviate the problem : the late payment of commercial debt -lrb- interest -rrb- act 1998 enables small businesses to claim statutory interest for late payment of commercial debts .
it includes the right to claim reasonable debt recovery costs , the right to challenge grossly unfair contractual terms that undermine the purpose of the legislation and the right for small- and medium-sized enterprises to ask a representative body to challenge unfair terms on their behalf .
there are measures that you can put in place yourself that may help you in minimising the risk of late payment , for example , ensuring that your payment terms are clearly stated on all documentation so that there can be no misunderstandings between you and your customer .
you could also consider offering a discount for early payment .
once your business is established , you could consider invoice financing which will offer you a way of off-setting some of the problems caused by late payment .
you will find useful information on the procedures for the importing of goods on the hm customs and excise website : http : / / www.hmce.gov.uk return to the top question ian black , uk in his latest book , john adair still maintains that one can " learn to lead " .
as a management lecturer , i think i can teach people to adopt a management approach , with hints of leadership , but if that leadership spark is not there then they will not be able to adjust what is really a basic personality trait .
any thoughts ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school i share your perspective , but let me qualify that a little .
the most important trait for a leader is wanting to lead - by which i mean a genuine desire to be accountable , to be responsible for people and their work , plus the qualities of character that enable the individual to weather storms with good humour and adaptability .
i also think that lots of people do n't realise what good leaders they might be if they were to step up to the plate .
confidence is important , but it does grow and should n't be a pre-requisite .
on the other side there are lots of people who do n't have any interest in being leaders because they know they would dislike it and find it stressful .
they should be left in peace , and i strongly resist any philosophy that makes them feel they ought to want to be leaders .
where i think " leadership " is universal , is that everyone in an organisation , at any position , should take responsibility for the people around them and take initiatives to help others , wherever they can see an opportunity to play a constructive role in the difficult issues to do with tasks and people that we all face .
keep teaching people and see what emerges !
return to the top question timo , england if i have an idea , but think the idea is already being used elsewhere in the world , how do i check the idea is patented , and can i still produce the idea over here if there is no patent in the uk ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you can check whether your idea has already been patented by visiting the patent office 's website : http : / / www.patent.gov.uk which holds details on more than 30 million worldwide patents .
if no one has already done so , then you may apply for a patent by filing a description and relevant drawings with the patent office .
to be patentable , your invention must be new , involve an innovative step , be capable of industrial application and not be on the patent office 's excluded list .
beware !
obtaining a full patent is a long and complex process .
although the initial application for a uk patent is free , obtaining a full grant will cost a few hundred pounds in fees - many times more if you require the expertise of a registered patent agent or are looking to market your invention abroad .
remember that patents are territorial rights so a uk patent will only give the holder rights within the uk and rights to stop others importing the product into the uk .
question mr n singh , england i am thinking of becoming a sole trader but all the information that i have been able to gather so far is very complicated to understand .
what do i need to do to start the business ?
who do i have to inform and when ?
what level of earnings can i earn before paying tax ?
do i have to pay national insurance contributions ?
do i need to employ an accountant ?
when will the vat be applicable - as in year one i will not know what my earnings will be and will not be charging vat to my customers ?
will i need to make my own arrangements for pension requirements ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you should consult my recent article on bbc news online : how to beat red tape which answers most of your questions .
you are not legally obliged to employ an accountant , although you may find it easier to do so when it comes to filling in your tax return .
you will need to make your own pension arrangements , which may take the form of additional voluntary national insurance contributions , a stakeholder pension or some other personal pension plan .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

bbc news online will publish its final set of answers from our panel of small business experts on tuesday , 14 october .
question maya wagle , us dame anita - your success has been phenomenal .
my questions are : what was the feminine trait you had to suppress in order to conform to a world driven by men ?
what feminine trait did you find most useful in your journey ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop conformity to me is like a sliver of death , sneaking into your brain and stagnating what keeps you feeling alive .
i conformed not one iota .
i turned the annual report and accounts into a document to delight , i brought a child development centre right smack into the headquarters .
there were love programmes where employees were given a certain sum of money to develop any interest they had -lrb- nothing related to the business -rrb- - the only stipulation was that no one could use the cash for learning golf !
there is a mythology going around that says the way for a woman to succeed is to act like a man , where you have to undergo a metaphorical sex change , be tough talking and express no feelings .
women build alliances , bring people together and most importantly they build intimate , informal networks and their biggest strength is communication .
what feminine traits did i find most useful ?
humour .
it cuts through everything .
return to the top question mark wilkes , uk i and two partners are opening a restaurant in the north-east of england .
our anticipated gross annual turnover is £ 190,000 .
we had initially budgeted for only £ 1,500 in advertising costs in the first year split as follows : leaflet drop / in local papers - £ 250 , university freshers ' packs - £ 400 , radio broadcast - £ 800 .
i have since found out that the radio advertising costs for one week on a well-listened-to station will be around £ 2,000 , including design for six adverts daily .
this would push us above the budget , however the cost is not too prohibitive .
would you recommend only advertising on radio , distributing the finance amongst other advertising mediums , or some other formulation ?
our aim is to attract people from across the spectrum , from professionals to students , and to allocate offers to different days of the week for the different client sectors .
is there a general formula which can be applied to advertising costs based upon expected turnover or profit ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer reading your question , i 'm a little concerned that you are trying to be all things to all people .
by targeting the student market and professionals , you are in danger of alienating both markets , as they require very different things from a restaurant .
it 's likely that you will have a quiet night and you can use a price incentive or value promotion to attract customers - but as soon as you target a group of people in a serious way -lrb- through advertising -rrb- , you are likely to be thought of as a restaurant catering just for that market .
the amount you spend on marketing is dictated by many things - including the amount of competing restaurants in your area , the amount that they advertise , the uniqueness of your restaurant , the profile of your restaurant etc .
there is no fixed formula but in our experience , restaurants spend on average 3-5 % of their turnover on marketing .
this would mean you might need to consider increasing your budget to ensure that consumers are constantly reminded of your restaurant .
do n't forget pr in your marketing mix .
make sure that the local papers and magazines are invited to the opening and keep an element of your menu fluid , so that there is always something to talk to the press about .
i think that advertising for just one week on the radio wo n't be enough to maintain the sort of awareness you need .
it would make a good launch promotion but i am sure that you will need to find a means to advertise the restaurant on a regular basis e.g. in a local newspaper or magazine , to be really effective .
it 's slightly away from your question but i showed your turnover projection to our sales director , samson sohail , who has worked with restaurants of all sizes for 10 years .
he thinks that any restaurant these days needs to be aiming for a minimum turnover of £ 5,000 per month to remain comfortably in business .
return to the top question sucheen patel , uk i have a business idea , which has a large fixed cost to set up , but the potential profits would cover the cost after three or four years .
are there any sources of funding available other than the traditional route of bank lending ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young your ability to raise funding for a new business will depend on a number of factors .
in this situation , banks , which do not have a particularly large margin on lendings and can not therefore afford to accept significant risk , tend to be unwilling to lend without good asset backing as security .
if your business is a new , unproven concept they will be even more reluctant to lend , as they will not be able to get comfortable that you can service the debt .
the government 's loan guarantee scheme can help , but in circumstances where the risk to the funder is high and the return is also potentially high , equity finance may be more appropriate .
other forms of debt for asset purchases , such as hire purchase and leasing , tend to be difficult for start-up businesses .
you should also check out whether there are any grants , whether uk or european , available to you .
this will depend largely on the type and location of your business .
equity funding can come from a variety of sources , including venture capitalists , business angels and friends and family .
your ability to raise venture capital will depend on the quality of the business idea and the management team you have assembled to execute the plan .
you will also find that the scale of your proposed business will have an impact - venture capitalists will only want to invest if they see the opportunity to create a business with significant value .
they therefore tend not to invest below £ 1m and often not much below £ 5m .
further information on venture capitalists can be obtained through the british venture capital association -lrb- bvca -rrb- at : http : / / www.bvca.co.uk below this level , angel investors , who are generally people who have been successful in business and are prepared to invest their time and money in young companies , are a potential source of finance and they are best contacted through one of a variety of angel organisations .
you can find details by contacting the national business angel network on 020 7329 29 29 or at : http : / / www.nationalbusangels.co.uk angel investors were very active during the dotcom boom , but there are fewer now and they tend to be more risk-averse .
many founders of businesses , particularly those starting out at a smaller scale and with little track record , have found that friends and family are one of the few sources available for equity finance .
return to the top question bob findlay , ireland i want to return to the uk and set up a " british " safari park - i.e. re-grow a small forest in the north east of england , where land is cheap and there are few people yet near good transport , and stock it with once british animals such as wolves , bears , wild boar , beaver wild cattle , deer etc .
what grants could i get towards this from the uk government , the eu , and wildlife and environmental organisations ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london what you are proposing is an interesting concept , but you need to go further than this and ensure that you believe there will be sufficient demand for the offer .
in particular , the size of the local catchment area will be key .
in addition , the start-up costs for such a venture would be substantial in order to ensure appropriate safety measures were in place and this should be taken into consideration .
in terms of grants , there are a vast number on offer in the uk , although i am not aware of any that specifically match up to your business idea .
objective two areas -lrb- an eu definition of regions going through the process of economic restructuring -rrb- are a frequent focus of grant funding .
however , they tend to be well-defined zones closer to city centres and conurbations rather than in the countryside and so they might not provide any opportunities .
however the wwf may have a specific initiative that matches well with your idea .
in addition , there are a number of designated rural regeneration zones in the uk and business assistance grants are available in some of these .
it is worth visiting : http : / / www.j4b.co.uk to further explore the grant options available to you .
contacting your local tourist board would also be beneficial .
it could perhaps assist with marketing details and also advise on the opportunities available for turning over land from agricultural to leisure purposes .
question lee head , uk i have toyed with the idea of opening up a cafe-bar for a couple of years now but have never taken it any further .
i am in a secure it job but would love a change .
i need to find information on start-up costs , potential grants available , financial support and projected income .
what 's stopping me is the thought of leaving a secure income of around £ 28k and diving into the great unknown .
if you can point me in the right direction to clarify some of those unknowns and reduce my risk , it could be the start of a new direction for me .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london i can understand that the thought of leaving a secure job unnerves you and quite rightly - starting a business is not a frivolous undertaking and there a number of key steps that must be taken to ensure you are making the right decision .
you need to be sure that you have a commercially viable proposition .
have you researched the market in your area ?
how stiff is the competition ?
is there a gap in the market for what you are thinking of offering ?
you need to be clear on these issues before proceeding any further .
given that you are considering changing your role from employee to owner-manager , you should also reflect on the commitment and work involved in setting up a business - particularly one in the hospitality sector , where 15-hour days are the norm -lrb- not including activities outside trading hours , such as sourcing food and day-to-day operational and management planning -rrb- .
unfortunately , there are no generic answers to the specific questions you ask , since the responses will differ on a case-by-case basis .
i suggest you take further advice in person , either via your local business link , chamber of commerce , an accountant or start-up lending team at your bank .
return to the top question christopher gore , hungary i started a business in hungary in 1991 and over the past 12 years have developed the largest owned network of insurance brokers in central eastern europe .
to date it has been almost impossible to raise small amounts of finance to develop our business in the region .
your advice would be useful .
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you have obviously already established a successful business , but you are right to continue to develop your business further .
in the uk , the two main sources of finance open to you are loan and equity .
i assume you have already investigated loan finance with your banker .
you do not disclose the size of the finance you are seeking , but if appropriate you could consider equity finance , venture capital firms or business angels , who can provide equity finance in return for a share in your company and may also offer personal managerial and entrepreneurial know-how to the business -lrb- as a non-exec director , for example -rrb- .
they may also be able to use their network of contacts to access extra and complimentary sources of finance .
additionally , you may be eligible for grant aid from the government - you should explore this option with your government offices .
question kenneth , uk i am about to start a small business importing plumbing accessories from china .
my products are items like metal casting , ball valve and other plumb fitting accessories widely used by all residential properties .
my target customers are plumbers merchants , wholesalers and plumbing accessories manufacturers .
i can see my biggest business risk is bad debts or non-payment by customers .
