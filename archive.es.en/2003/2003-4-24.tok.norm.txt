companies in germany must shell out as much as an additional 81 cents in benefits and insurance costs against each euro they pay in wages to employees .
critics say this is hurting an already depressed labor market . with a stagnant economy and more than 4.6 million unemployed workers , the country 's labor market has shrunk dramatically . many employers complain that the social insurance contributions companies are required to make as well as payment of generous benefits most german workers are accustomed to , make it difficult for companies to grow .
the proof is in the pudding : for every euro an employee earns in the industrial sector in western germany , the employer pays an average of 81 cents toward that worker 's social insurance and other benefits .

the biggest chunk of an employer 's contribution goes to an employee 's social insurance - which includes a state pension plan , health care and both unemployment and nursing care insurance .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .

companies in germany must shell out as much as an additional 81 cents in benefits and insurance costs against each euro they pay in wages to employees .
critics say this is hurting an already depressed labor market . with a stagnant economy and more than 4.6 million unemployed workers , the country 's labor market has shrunk dramatically . many employers complain that the social insurance contributions companies are required to make as well as payment of generous benefits most german workers are accustomed to , make it difficult for companies to grow .
the proof is in the pudding : for every euro an employee earns in the industrial sector in western germany , the employer pays an average of 81 cents toward that worker 's social insurance and other benefits .
whether referred to as ancillary wage costs , supplementary personnel costs or a " second wage , " non-wage labor costs represent the benefits and costs covered by both private- and government employers that are in addition to the normal salary paid to an employee .
the biggest chunk of an employer 's contribution goes to an employee 's social insurance - which includes a state pension plan , health care and both unemployment and nursing care insurance .
in most cases , the amount an employer pays on behalf of an employee to the social insurance system is equivalent to 42 percent of the person 's direct salary .
taken together , these costs total an average of € 22,000 per year for each worker .
politicians want cuts leaders of two of germany 's major political parties acknowledge there is a problem .
the opposition christian democratic union , led by national chairwoman angela merkel , has called for a reduction of non-wage labor costs . and wolfgang clement , germany 's social democratic " superminister " for labor and economics , is on the record saying that reductions in non-wage labor costs are necessary to " rekindle " investment in the country .
the costs can be staggering .
at banks and insurance companies , where salaries tend to be more generous , the " second wage " can sometimes be even higher than the worker 's traditional salary .
non-wage costs at german banks are the highest in the country , averaging 101.7 percent of an employee 's salary .
the percentage is slightly less for the insurance sector , but it still towers far above other industries .
non-wage costs are lowest in the wholesaling sector , where they average about 68.9 percent of salaries .
a disconnect in addition to social insurance , companies are also made to foot the bill for statutory industrial injury insurance .
employers are also expected to cover the first six weeks of an employee 's wages and social insurance premiums during a period of extended illness before the state takes over the responsibility - even if those days fall during a person 's vacation or on national holidays .
a number of one-time annual payments must also be considered in calculating any non-wage costs . german law also requires that employers also pay social insurance premium 's for 13th and 14th-month bonuses , further driving up non-wage costs .
other line items often include subsidies for employee cafeterias , workplace daycare centers , work-related field trips , vocational training and part-time work during an employee 's final years and other forms of early retirement .
east-west divide considerable regional differences exist in non-wage labor costs across germany .
as with salaries , costs tend to be lower in the formerly communist eastern german states than in industrial western half of the country .
in eastern germany , non-wage labor costs average approximately € 12,855 per person , or 68 percent of direct wages and earnings .
the primary reason for the divide is that there are fewer large companies in eastern germany .
massive western german corporations , like daimlerbenz or bayer are especially generous when it comes to social benefits , and supplementary personnel costs generally run higher .
that trend has n't gone unnoticed by investors .

companies in germany must shell out as much as an additional 81 cents in benefits and insurance costs against each euro they pay in wages to employees .
critics say this is hurting an already depressed labor market . with a stagnant economy and more than 4.6 million unemployed workers , the country 's labor market has shrunk dramatically . many employers complain that the social insurance contributions companies are required to make as well as payment of generous benefits most german workers are accustomed to , make it difficult for companies to grow .
the proof is in the pudding : for every euro an employee earns in the industrial sector in western germany , the employer pays an average of 81 cents toward that worker 's social insurance and other benefits .
whether referred to as ancillary wage costs , supplementary personnel costs or a " second wage , " non-wage labor costs represent the benefits and costs covered by both private- and government employers that are in addition to the normal salary paid to an employee .
the biggest chunk of an employer 's contribution goes to an employee 's social insurance - which includes a state pension plan , health care and both unemployment and nursing care insurance .
in most cases , the amount an employer pays on behalf of an employee to the social insurance system is equivalent to 42 percent of the person 's direct salary .
taken together , these costs total an average of € 22,000 per year for each worker .
politicians want cuts leaders of two of germany 's major political parties acknowledge there is a problem .
the opposition christian democratic union , led by national chairwoman angela merkel , has called for a reduction of non-wage labor costs . and wolfgang clement , germany 's social democratic " superminister " for labor and economics , is on the record saying that reductions in non-wage labor costs are necessary to " rekindle " investment in the country .
the costs can be staggering .
at banks and insurance companies , where salaries tend to be more generous , the " second wage " can sometimes be even higher than the worker 's traditional salary .
non-wage costs at german banks are the highest in the country , averaging 101.7 percent of an employee 's salary .
the percentage is slightly less for the insurance sector , but it still towers far above other industries .
non-wage costs are lowest in the wholesaling sector , where they average about 68.9 percent of salaries .
a disconnect in addition to social insurance , companies are also made to foot the bill for statutory industrial injury insurance .
employers are also expected to cover the first six weeks of an employee 's wages and social insurance premiums during a period of extended illness before the state takes over the responsibility - even if those days fall during a person 's vacation or on national holidays .
a number of one-time annual payments must also be considered in calculating any non-wage costs . german law also requires that employers also pay social insurance premium 's for 13th and 14th-month bonuses , further driving up non-wage costs .
other line items often include subsidies for employee cafeterias , workplace daycare centers , work-related field trips , vocational training and part-time work during an employee 's final years and other forms of early retirement .
east-west divide considerable regional differences exist in non-wage labor costs across germany .
as with salaries , costs tend to be lower in the formerly communist eastern german states than in industrial western half of the country .
in eastern germany , non-wage labor costs average approximately € 12,855 per person , or 68 percent of direct wages and earnings .
the primary reason for the divide is that there are fewer large companies in eastern germany .
massive western german corporations , like daimlerbenz or bayer are especially generous when it comes to social benefits , and supplementary personnel costs generally run higher .
that trend has n't gone unnoticed by investors .
many companies that invested in the reconstruction of eastern germany did so insisting that they not be tied to the kinds of generous benefit packages that have long burdened many companies in western germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .

the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .

companies in germany must shell out as much as an additional 81 cents in benefits and insurance costs against each euro they pay in wages to employees .
critics say this is hurting an already depressed labor market . with a stagnant economy and more than 4.6 million unemployed workers , the country 's labor market has shrunk dramatically . many employers complain that the social insurance contributions companies are required to make as well as payment of generous benefits most german workers are accustomed to , make it difficult for companies to grow .
the proof is in the pudding : for every euro an employee earns in the industrial sector in western germany , the employer pays an average of 81 cents toward that worker 's social insurance and other benefits .
whether referred to as ancillary wage costs , supplementary personnel costs or a " second wage , " non-wage labor costs represent the benefits and costs covered by both private- and government employers that are in addition to the normal salary paid to an employee .
the biggest chunk of an employer 's contribution goes to an employee 's social insurance - which includes a state pension plan , health care and both unemployment and nursing care insurance .
in most cases , the amount an employer pays on behalf of an employee to the social insurance system is equivalent to 42 percent of the person 's direct salary .
taken together , these costs total an average of € 22,000 per year for each worker .
politicians want cuts leaders of two of germany 's major political parties acknowledge there is a problem .
the opposition christian democratic union , led by national chairwoman angela merkel , has called for a reduction of non-wage labor costs . and wolfgang clement , germany 's social democratic " superminister " for labor and economics , is on the record saying that reductions in non-wage labor costs are necessary to " rekindle " investment in the country .
the costs can be staggering .
at banks and insurance companies , where salaries tend to be more generous , the " second wage " can sometimes be even higher than the worker 's traditional salary .
non-wage costs at german banks are the highest in the country , averaging 101.7 percent of an employee 's salary .
the percentage is slightly less for the insurance sector , but it still towers far above other industries .
non-wage costs are lowest in the wholesaling sector , where they average about 68.9 percent of salaries .
a disconnect in addition to social insurance , companies are also made to foot the bill for statutory industrial injury insurance .
employers are also expected to cover the first six weeks of an employee 's wages and social insurance premiums during a period of extended illness before the state takes over the responsibility - even if those days fall during a person 's vacation or on national holidays .
a number of one-time annual payments must also be considered in calculating any non-wage costs . german law also requires that employers also pay social insurance premium 's for 13th and 14th-month bonuses , further driving up non-wage costs .
other line items often include subsidies for employee cafeterias , workplace daycare centers , work-related field trips , vocational training and part-time work during an employee 's final years and other forms of early retirement .
east-west divide considerable regional differences exist in non-wage labor costs across germany .
as with salaries , costs tend to be lower in the formerly communist eastern german states than in industrial western half of the country .
in eastern germany , non-wage labor costs average approximately € 12,855 per person , or 68 percent of direct wages and earnings .
the primary reason for the divide is that there are fewer large companies in eastern germany .
massive western german corporations , like daimlerbenz or bayer are especially generous when it comes to social benefits , and supplementary personnel costs generally run higher .
that trend has n't gone unnoticed by investors .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .

companies in germany must shell out as much as an additional 81 cents in benefits and insurance costs against each euro they pay in wages to employees .

the biggest chunk of an employer 's contribution goes to an employee 's social insurance - which includes a state pension plan , health care and both unemployment and nursing care insurance .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2003 german banks to pool loans to free up capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's humbled banks still dominate the frankfurt skyline .
germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .
-lrb- february 2 , 2003 -rrb- dark days for german banks with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .

companies in germany must shell out as much as an additional 81 cents in benefits and insurance costs against each euro they pay in wages to employees .
critics say this is hurting an already depressed labor market . with a stagnant economy and more than 4.6 million unemployed workers , the country 's labor market has shrunk dramatically . many employers complain that the social insurance contributions companies are required to make as well as payment of generous benefits most german workers are accustomed to , make it difficult for companies to grow .
the proof is in the pudding : for every euro an employee earns in the industrial sector in western germany , the employer pays an average of 81 cents toward that worker 's social insurance and other benefits .
whether referred to as ancillary wage costs , supplementary personnel costs or a " second wage , " non-wage labor costs represent the benefits and costs covered by both private- and government employers that are in addition to the normal salary paid to an employee .
the biggest chunk of an employer 's contribution goes to an employee 's social insurance - which includes a state pension plan , health care and both unemployment and nursing care insurance .
in most cases , the amount an employer pays on behalf of an employee to the social insurance system is equivalent to 42 percent of the person 's direct salary .
taken together , these costs total an average of € 22,000 per year for each worker .
politicians want cuts leaders of two of germany 's major political parties acknowledge there is a problem .
the opposition christian democratic union , led by national chairwoman angela merkel , has called for a reduction of non-wage labor costs . and wolfgang clement , germany 's social democratic " superminister " for labor and economics , is on the record saying that reductions in non-wage labor costs are necessary to " rekindle " investment in the country .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .

the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .

companies in germany must shell out as much as an additional 81 cents in benefits and insurance costs against each euro they pay in wages to employees .
critics say this is hurting an already depressed labor market . with a stagnant economy and more than 4.6 million unemployed workers , the country 's labor market has shrunk dramatically . many employers complain that the social insurance contributions companies are required to make as well as payment of generous benefits most german workers are accustomed to , make it difficult for companies to grow .
the proof is in the pudding : for every euro an employee earns in the industrial sector in western germany , the employer pays an average of 81 cents toward that worker 's social insurance and other benefits .
whether referred to as ancillary wage costs , supplementary personnel costs or a " second wage , " non-wage labor costs represent the benefits and costs covered by both private- and government employers that are in addition to the normal salary paid to an employee .
the biggest chunk of an employer 's contribution goes to an employee 's social insurance - which includes a state pension plan , health care and both unemployment and nursing care insurance .
in most cases , the amount an employer pays on behalf of an employee to the social insurance system is equivalent to 42 percent of the person 's direct salary .
taken together , these costs total an average of € 22,000 per year for each worker .
politicians want cuts leaders of two of germany 's major political parties acknowledge there is a problem .
the opposition christian democratic union , led by national chairwoman angela merkel , has called for a reduction of non-wage labor costs . and wolfgang clement , germany 's social democratic " superminister " for labor and economics , is on the record saying that reductions in non-wage labor costs are necessary to " rekindle " investment in the country .
the costs can be staggering .
at banks and insurance companies , where salaries tend to be more generous , the " second wage " can sometimes be even higher than the worker 's traditional salary .
non-wage costs at german banks are the highest in the country , averaging 101.7 percent of an employee 's salary .
the percentage is slightly less for the insurance sector , but it still towers far above other industries .
non-wage costs are lowest in the wholesaling sector , where they average about 68.9 percent of salaries .
a disconnect in addition to social insurance , companies are also made to foot the bill for statutory industrial injury insurance .
employers are also expected to cover the first six weeks of an employee 's wages and social insurance premiums during a period of extended illness before the state takes over the responsibility - even if those days fall during a person 's vacation or on national holidays .
a number of one-time annual payments must also be considered in calculating any non-wage costs . german law also requires that employers also pay social insurance premium 's for 13th and 14th-month bonuses , further driving up non-wage costs .
other line items often include subsidies for employee cafeterias , workplace daycare centers , work-related field trips , vocational training and part-time work during an employee 's final years and other forms of early retirement .
east-west divide considerable regional differences exist in non-wage labor costs across germany .
as with salaries , costs tend to be lower in the formerly communist eastern german states than in industrial western half of the country .
in eastern germany , non-wage labor costs average approximately € 12,855 per person , or 68 percent of direct wages and earnings .
the primary reason for the divide is that there are fewer large companies in eastern germany .
massive western german corporations , like daimlerbenz or bayer are especially generous when it comes to social benefits , and supplementary personnel costs generally run higher .
that trend has n't gone unnoticed by investors .
many companies that invested in the reconstruction of eastern germany did so insisting that they not be tied to the kinds of generous benefit packages that have long burdened many companies in western germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .
-lrb- february 2 , 2003 -rrb- dark days for german banks with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks .

the percentage is slightly less for the insurance sector , but it still towers far above other industries .
non-wage costs are lowest in the wholesaling sector , where they average about 68.9 percent of salaries .
a disconnect in addition to social insurance , companies are also made to foot the bill for statutory industrial injury insurance .
employers are also expected to cover the first six weeks of an employee 's wages and social insurance premiums during a period of extended illness before the state takes over the responsibility - even if those days fall during a person 's vacation or on national holidays .
a number of one-time annual payments must also be considered in calculating any non-wage costs . german law also requires that employers also pay social insurance premium 's for 13th and 14th-month bonuses , further driving up non-wage costs .
other line items often include subsidies for employee cafeterias , workplace daycare centers , work-related field trips , vocational training and part-time work during an employee 's final years and other forms of early retirement .
east-west divide considerable regional differences exist in non-wage labor costs across germany .
as with salaries , costs tend to be lower in the formerly communist eastern german states than in industrial western half of the country .
in eastern germany , non-wage labor costs average approximately € 12,855 per person , or 68 percent of direct wages and earnings .
the primary reason for the divide is that there are fewer large companies in eastern germany .
massive western german corporations , like daimlerbenz or bayer are especially generous when it comes to social benefits , and supplementary personnel costs generally run higher .
that trend has n't gone unnoticed by investors .
many companies that invested in the reconstruction of eastern germany did so insisting that they not be tied to the kinds of generous benefit packages that have long burdened many companies in western germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s top banks , struggling in a tough market , have come up with a novel way to move loans off their books in order to free up capital for lending .
the government hopes it will help the cash-strapped economy . the country ’ s five top commercial banks , deutsche bank ag , hvb group , commerzbank ag , dresdner bank ag and dz bank announced on wednesday they would pool up to € 50 billion -lrb- $ 54 billion -rrb- in loans and would transfer them to a joint venture run by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , germany ’ s development bank . the kfw will then sell bonds backed by the investment-grade loans .
the process , know as securitization , is widespread in the united states and other european countries , but the market in germany has been hampered by taxation of the vehicles used for such asset-backed securities . the banks expect the initiative will help them recover from the worst financial sector downturn since world war ii .
for its part , the government hopes the banks will become more inclined to lend to the country ’ s companies that have suffered amid a credit crunch . “ we have to ensure that banks remain capable of granting new loans to small and mid-sized businesses .
a major condition of that is to reduce their outstanding loans to improve their balance sheets , ” said kfw chairman hans reich . reliance on bank lending german companies have traditionally relied more on bank lending than equity markets for raising cash .
much of europe ’ s largest economy is made up of small to mid-sized firms , know as the mittelstand .
as germany ’ s banks have suffered from mounting loan defaults and slumping share prices , they have become more hesitant to lend to mittelstand companies , which in turn has hampered economic growth overall . “ what we want to ensure is that we can continue to fulfill the credit wishes of our customers , ” said commerzbank board member nicholas teller . by securitizing the loans , banks would free up funds because they would no longer be required to back the credit risk of the loans with equity .
but some fear the endeavor could also end up being a state-backed “ bad bank ” that would deal with the sector ’ s growing bad loans . questions on kfw support steffen kampeter , parliamentary spokesman for budgetary affairs for the opposition christian democrats , said on thursday the banks didn ’ t need the kfw ’ s support for securitizing credit-worthy loans .
because it is backed by the german government , the kfw has the best possible aaa credit rating . “ it is completely naive to assume that such a venture will only deal with good loans , ” kampeter told the reuters news agency .
“ maybe at the beginning that will be the case , but down the road naturally bad risks will also be securitized . ” earlier this year , germany ’ s top commercial banks proposed the idea of spinning off billions of euros in bad loans to a government supported bank , which would free deutsche , dresdner and the others from being dragged down by the non-performing loans . the german finance ministry , reich from the kfw and the commercial banks have all denied that the joint venture would deal with anything less than investment-grade loans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german banks want to pass loan liability to government germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings .
-lrb- february 2 , 2003 -rrb- dark days for german banks with forced reductions in workforce numbers , worrying drops in share prices and terminally ill financial results , the light at the end of the tunnel still seems a long way off for german banks .

they say they have learned that casualty units at hospitals in england and wales have an average of 2.8 consultants among their staff .
that is less than the bare minimum of three recommended by the british association of accident and emergency medicine -lrb- baem -rrb- and far short of the eight it says should be available .
liberal democrat health spokesman dr evan harris called on the government to act , adding : " in some areas , the level of cover endangers patients ' lives . "
' safe care ' the fewest senior staff were employed in the devon and somerset area and in the shropshire and staffordshire hospitals .
each had an average 1.4 consultants per department , the liberal democrats said .
west yorkshire , with an average 5.3 consultants , was the best staffed area .
dr harris told the express newspaper : " the government is obsessed with political targets and fiddling the figures .
" but what really matters to patients is getting access to quality and safe care . "
' political targets ' dr harris , who was given the figures by health minister john hutton in a written parliamentary answer , said casualty departments must have access to enough senior doctors .
he said those that were employed often found themselves under intolerable pressure .
" the senior doctors who are available are often forced to distort their priorities to meet political targets , " he said .
" junior doctors are forced to work without supervision , and consultants are over-stretched . "
a spokesman for the department of health said : " if a & e departments do have fewer than three consultants , consideration must be given to other ways of providing senior leadership during leave , such as the employment of a locum consultant or the substantive appointment of an associate specialist .
" ' workforce planning in a & e medicine , 2001 - 2010 ' , was a discussion document published in 2001 which suggested a radical option of increased shop floor presence for a & e consultants and said that if that option was implemented it would require eight consultants per department .

the most recent attacks took place in the lisburn road and holywood road areas of the city .
in one incident , an employee was attacked by a gang of more than 30 youths while a cable worker suffered a broken arm after being attacked with missiles .
last year , a two-man repair team was threatened at gunpoint .
the firm does not believe any of the incidents are paramilitary related .
nie said that if its staff have to leave repair sites , it will not only delay the restoration of power , but could result in a wider loss of supplies if a substation has to be shut off because of exposed cables .
spokesman robin greer said : " these deplorable attacks on workers trying to do their job means we are left with a choice between the safety of our staff , the safety of local residents and having to disconnect areas from the grid to ensure damaged cables are not left live .
" we can not ask staff to stay at the scene of a fault if they are under threat . "
nie warned the threat had been heightened with the longer evenings , leading to an increase in vandalism that causes power cuts .
mr greer added : " we are therefore issuing this appeal to community representatives and parents to use their influence to allow our workers to do their job for the benefit of the community . "

carmarthenshire council currently has seven prosecutions ongoing against parents of truants and has warned that it will begin more in the coming weeks .
last week , a 35-year-old woman was imprisoned for 28 days after failing to ensure that her 14-year-old son went to school .
the teenager had not attended his comprehensive in llanelli for three months .
parents have a clear responsibility to ensure their children are in school and we will not hesitate to take them to court if they neglect that responsibility philip jones , carmarthenshire council the woman , who can not be named , lost an appeal at swansea crown court against the original sentence , despite an apology from her truant son .
councillor mary thomas , the executive board member for education at carmarthenshire council , said jail was " a last resort " to tackle the problem .
" every opportunity is given both to the parents and children before cases are brought to court , " she said .
she also added that the council had proved it was serious about enforcing its policy .
damaged education there have been around 20 prosecutions across carmarthenshire for truancy so far this year .
carmarthenshire education welfare officer , philip jones , said : " a huge amount of support is available to parents and we will always explore all avenues before court proceedings .
" -lrb- pupils ' -rrb- education is being damaged if they miss lessons .
" parents have a clear responsibility to ensure their children are in school and we will not hesitate to take them to court if they neglect that responsibility . "
the carmarthenshire truant has apologised under laws introduced in 2000 , penalties for persistent truancy were increased to a maximum fine of £ 2,500 or a jail term of three months .
several parents had been jailed in england , before the carmarthenshire woman became the first parent to be imprisoned under the new legislation in wales .
but a group which has been set up to campaign against the new truancy laws has condemned carmarthenshire 's policy .
louise harvey , who is spokeswoman for the group parents against truancy court orders -lrb- patco -rrb- , said : " we would urge families to get in contact with us when they are taken to court .
" we would advise parents to plead not guilty to any offence and seek to resolve the situation another way .
" most cases of truancy have a medical basis .
children may be bullied , have a special need like attention deficit disorder , or have a phobia .
" magistrates are lay people and not experts and may not know the underlying reasons for truancy .
" jailing parents is a quick solution to a complicated problem .
