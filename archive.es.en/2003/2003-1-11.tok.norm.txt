bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- time to tackle witness intimidation news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk saturday , 11 january , 2003 , 08:30 gmt time to tackle witness intimidation the government says it wants to find better ways to prevent the problem of witness intimidation , as part of measures to crackdown on gun crime in england and wales .
harassment is not only a terrifying ordeal for witnesses of crime , but also stops many serious incidents from reaching the courts and justice being served because people are afraid to testify .
the majority of people who either fall victim to or witness a crime respond by contacting the police , and so begins the process of tracking down the culprits and bringing them to justice .
however , in a minority of cases , the perpetrators turn on victims or witnesses and bully them into backing down from reporting the crime .
their tactics range from verbal and physical threats to full-blown assaults and attacks on property .
it is a terrifying situation and one which can dissuade even the most determined individuals from reporting an incident .
criminal offence victim intimidation is more likely to follow offences of violence and vandalism , according to the british crime survey -lrb- bcs -rrb- 1998 .
women are particularly likely to experience intimidation following a violent offence -lrb- 26 % -rrb- - many of these incidents involve domestic violence .
in most cases -lrb- 85 % -rrb- the person carrying out witness harassment is the original offender - however it is sometimes the offender 's family or friends .
simon hughes : better protection needed witness intimidation happens usually in cases where people have witnessed either an act of vandalism , car crime or a serious fight or assault , according to the bcs .
about 75 % had been intimidated by the original offender and about 20 % were threatened by the perpetrator 's family or friends .
any such intimidation is a criminal offence and punishable under the 1994 criminal justice and public order act .
however some , including liberal democrat home affairs spokesman simon hughes , believe it is not enough of a deterrent .
death threat mr hughes , who is mp for north southwark and bermondsey , knows at first hand the seriousness of witness harassment and intimidation .
a contract was taken out on his life in october 1999 , after he successfully persuaded key witnesses to give evidence that helped convict a gang of thugs who had beaten a teenage boy to death in london .
he persuaded witnesses to come forward in the case of 17-year-old jamie robe , who was murdered on the osprey estate , rotherhithe in august 1997 .
the trial of jamie robe 's killers involved witness protection the ensuing police investigation and trial cost the taxpayer dearly to ensure justice was carried out .
about 20 people had to be moved away from their homes by the metropolitan police 's witness protection unit - one of eight nationwide , with powers to provide new homes , new identities , new jobs , and in some cases , new schools for witnesses ' children .
eventually , the witnesses were able to give evidence from behind a screen while wearing balaclavas and boiler suits .
mr hughes had a round-the-clock guard on his home and office after the threat was made .
' swift action ' of the current situation on witness protection , he told bbc news online : " it is better than it used to be .
" witnesses can appear behind a screen and do n't have to give their address in court .
" but the thing that has totally failed is giving people assurances they can move .
" i have set up a scheme in southwark where if there is domestic violence , there is a very speedy system of dealing with the case .
" if someone is a victim of this , they can get swift action with both social services and the police involved . "
mr hughes is also trying to influence the criminal justice bill .
he said : " i 'm proposing that we might get a more common system whereby evidence of prosecution or defence witnesses who feel vulnerable does n't automatically get passed on to the other side unless the court authorises it and decides it is safe .
" the evidence would n't be shown if it was n't going to be used and the court would decide how the person giving evidence would be protected . "
the criminal justice bill would allow some trials to be heard in front of a judge only , if there was a strong suspicion of jury-tampering .

this legal limbo is a continuing violation of human rights standards amnesty international the call comes on the first anniversary of the arrival of prisoners from afghanistan .
about 600 suspected taleban and al-qaeda fighters are being held at the american base , in what amnesty describes as a " legal black hole " .
the inmates - who come from 40 different countries - have been classified by the us as unlawful combatants , not prisoners of war , and have no right to legal representation or family visits .
suicide attempts since the prisoners were first taken to guantanamo bay , human rights activists have complained bitterly about their treatment .
camp delta about 600 alleged al-qaeda and taleban fighters being held inmates from 40 countries suspects classified as unlawful combatants " this legal limbo is a continuing violation of human rights standards which the international community must not ignore , " amnesty said .
" no access to the courts , lawyers or relatives ; the prospect of indefinite detention in small cells for up to 24 hours a day ; the possibility of trials by executive military commissions with the power to hand down death sentences and no right of appeal : is this how the us defends human rights and the rule of law ? "
only five men - described as " not dangerous " - have been released .
all the prisoners have now been moved from the initial wire-fenced confines of camp x ray to the more substantial camp delta .
there they live in single cells , but because they can see one another are frequently shifted around , apparently to prevent cliques forming .
there have been a few , unsuccessful suicide attempts .
appeal the us defence department says it is treating the prisoners humanely and that the main reason it continues to hold them is to glean information .
it says intelligence gained from repeated interrogation has helped prevent terrorist attacks around the world .
no hint is being given as to when the prisoners will either be charged or freed .
but the bbc 's stephen gibbs in havana says that the intention is to hold them until the war on terrorism is over according to one official .
lawyers for many of the prisoners - including two of the seven britons being held - have argued that the prisoners should be charged in court or released .
but the court of appeals in washington dc has yet to rule in the case . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's daniel boettcher " 600 people are still being held without charge " kate allen , amnesty international uk " this really is not acceptable " camp delta operation commander , colonel mcqueen " we have a joint team working to provide a safe environment for the detainees " full coverage key stories hunting an iraqi link guantanamo update european probe spanish swoop italy on alert hamburg connection europe 's al-qaeda hunt background al-qaeda battle update who 's who in al-qaeda roots of jihad al-qaeda 's origins in depth the investigation the money trail see also : 11 jan 03 -pipe- americas no fast track at guantanamo bay 29 oct 02 -pipe- south asia afghans tell of guantanamo ordeal 02 dec 02 -pipe- americas new plea for cuba camp inmates 24 aug 02 -pipe- from our own correspondent us bides its time in guantanamo 08 feb 02 -pipe- americas legal implications unclear 10 sep 02 -pipe- england terror suspects urge uk to intervene 21 jan 02 -pipe- politics from student to terror suspect 27 feb 02 -pipe- americas camp x-ray : the legal options internet links : amnesty international the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution chicago club owners face charges peru 's ex-spy chief on public trial venezuela signs non-violence pact us plays down n korean threat us struggles to clear snow hacker breaches credit card security bolivian cabinet resigns links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- scotland -pipe- blunder triggered water scare news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk : scotland news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk saturday , 11 january , 2003 , 09:37 gmt blunder triggered water scare the water was contaminated with cryptosporidium a report by a water regulator has exposed a series of blunders during the cryptosporidium scare in scotland last year .
the drinking water quality regulator -lrb- dwqr -rrb- said that thousands of people were exposed to potentially contaminated water because plant workers thought a valve was a water meter .
clydebank residents received water that might have been contaminated because of the mistake during a cryptosporidium bug scare last year .
around 150,000 people in the west of scotland were told to boil their water after cryptosporidium levels rose at the mugdock reservoir .
customers were advised to boil water but clydebank residents were warned several days later than the rest .
the dwqr report praised the actions of staff at the milngavie water treatment works , which is served by mugdock , in the run up to the incident .
but it added : " in the event an exemplary piece of planning and execution was spoiled because a valve had been mistaken as a water meter .
" this resulted in an area of clydebank continuing to receive water from mugdock reservoir when it was initially thought an alternative supply had been provided . "
the report also concluded that scottish water narrowly missed being punished over maintenance at a separate water treatment plant at fairmilehead , near edinburgh .
crucial faults the plant was at the centre of a similar alert around the same time as the glasgow scares , although a boil water warning was withdrawn after only a few hours because scottish water had issued it by mistake .
the dwqr report said there had been a " failure of due diligence " at the plant because crucial faults that were known about had not been solved .
and it said : " had scottish water not acted so promptly following the incident to resolve the outstanding maintenance issues then the dwqr would certainly have had to take enforcement action . "
the findings came as the scottish executive published new rules for handling public health incidents involving cryptosporidium in the water supply .
in the event an exemplary piece of planning and execution was spoiled because a valve had been mistaken as a water meter dwqr report health minister malcolm chisholm said the updated guidance for public agencies was based on advice from an expert group set up by the executive in the wake of the scares .
he added : " we will also be publishing updated guidance for management of all types of public health incidents for consultation later this month . "
a second report was also published today from the incident control team -lrb- ict -rrb- set up to look at the events surrounding the scare in edinburgh .
the report made 15 recommendations and although it confirmed the bug had been found in the water supply , it concluded the water had been safe .
cryptosporidium is a parasite usually spread by farm animals which is rarely fatal but can cause severe abdominal pains , vomiting and diarrhoea .

the call comes on the first anniversary of the arrival of inmates from afghanistan .
about 600 suspected taleban and al-qaeda fighters are being held at the base .
the eight uk detainees include three from tipton in the west midlands , shafiq rasul , asif iqbal and ruhal ahmed , whose mp has backed amnesty 's call .
if tony blair understood what it means to have a child , he would have done something about it by now shaleha begum , ruhal ahmed 's mother the three , all in their 20s , were captured a year ago by us forces while reportedly fighting alongside al-qaeda members in afghanistan .
they have been held without charge ever since .
mr ahmed 's father , riasoth ahmed , told bbc radio 4 's today programme he was concerned he had not heard from his son for some time .
" over the last two months i have received no letters .
before that , every month i would receive a letter from him saying ' i 'm fine , do n't worry for me ' . "
he issued a plea to prime minister tony blair : " please , help my boy .
say something to the american government to release him . "
' no justification ' mr ahmed 's mother , shaleha begum , said she had been going through " mental torture " worrying about her son 's imprisonment .
she had written many times to mr blair asking to meet to discuss her son 's case , but had received no reply , she said .
speaking through an interpreter , she told today : " if tony blair understood what it means to have a child , he would have done something about it by now .
" he does n't realise what it is like to be a mother and not have your child close to you and held somewhere else for no reason . "
seven of the men are from the uk a campaigner for the three men , mushtaq ahmed , told today : " so far , they have n't been charged , yet they continue to be humiliated , degraded , caged up and brutalised with no justification whatsoever .
" these violations of human rights are happening in front of us and yet people feel helpless . "
their mp adrian bailey said that while they had serious questions to answer , the us authorities should charge them and give them the chance to put their cases forward .
last month mr rasul and mr iqbal launched an appeal to have their cases heard , but no decision has been reached .
their lawyer , clive stafford smith , told the bbc : " these kids , who honestly i do n't think have committed any crime against the us , are not allowed lawyers , they 're not allowed to see their mum and dad , they 're not allowed to be told what they have done wrong , they 're not allowed to be put on trial .
" i think that is fundamentally wrong . "
activists ' complaints tony blair has said it would be irresponsible to release the detainees while they had information that could prevent further terrorist attacks .
since the inmates first arrived at guantanamo bay , human rights activists have complained about their treatment .
only five - described as " not dangerous " - have been released , with the rest in a legal limbo .

they are kept in single cells , but are moved regularly , apparently to prevent cliques forming .
there have been a few , unsuccessful suicide attempts .
