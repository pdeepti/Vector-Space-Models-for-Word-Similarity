that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .
this time even more people will decide late because the issue is more complicated , " he told the financial times . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to violate deficit rules for second year the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .

more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .
indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .
by handing the germans lucrative business opportunities which will in turn help the united states get a grip on areas of reconstruction , washington would have some serious bargaining power with berlin over a new united nations resolution on iraq as well as a base for pushing for support for a possible nato deployment in the gulf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies get serious about iraq as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond .

german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments . the stuttgarter zeitung noted that german chancellor gerhard schröder chose weighty words for his turkish visitor when he told prime minister tayyip erdogan it was in germany ’ s national interest for his country to have closer european union ties .
erdogan appeared to hear this with " great satisfaction , " the paper wrote , since none of schröder ’ s predecessors have ever spoken out in favor of allowing turkey to join the eu .
the düsseldorf-based rheinische post opined on the reality of any serious political discussion about turkey in germany : it raises people ’ s blood pressure .
a lot of the arguments are overblown , the paper wrote , while others are swept under the carpet .
the government is annoyed that the opposition conservatives want to prevent turkey from joining the eu .
but what 's new about that , wonders the paper ?
" christian social union leader edmund stoiber made that very clear last december - he simply wanted a public debate on the issue which never occurred , " the paper wrote .
hanover ’ s neue presse dismissed the opposition conservative ’ s position on turkey as short-sighted .
" if their european policy 50 years ago had been as short-sighted , the eu may never have been created , " the paper ’ s editors opined .
" and germany would have had a much more difficult time finding its path in western politics .
the post-war conservative chancellor adenauer cemented germany ’ s position in the west and thereby secured its liberalization just the just as the conservative muslim erdogan is trying to do now .
one wishes he could have as courageous and clever partners as adenauer would have been , " the paper concluded .
dresden 's sächsiche zeitung pointed out that the eu - whether it fits into the screeching german conservatives plan or not - gave turkey a european perspective back in the 1960s and strengthened this by giving it official candidate status in 1999 .
the paper noted that more than one german conservative government played a role .
still , turkey still has much left to do in order to bring the country in line with the most important eu criteria .
two weeks after the mass-circulation bild newspaper published an article about " florida rolf , " a german living on welfare in florida , german social and health minister renate schmidt is tightening regulations .
the badische zeitung in freiburg noted that , despite all the hype , a mere 959 germans receive social welfare overseas – making up 0.024 percent of all those on benefits .
the paper added that " the majority of people receiving benefits overseas are single mothers fighting for custody of their children , prisoners who may be sitting wrongly accused in prison as well as the aged and ill who are unable to travel .
that the government is using its position to appear tough is more worrying , " the paper concludes .
the leipziger volkszeitung wrote that the 2.8 million people receiving welfare in germany can only dream of sunny florida .
" of course there are some people happy not to have to slog away at work or those attached to the bottle from dawn to dusk , there are thousands of those who would be happy just to have a job , " the paper opined , before underlining the real problem : which is that there aren ’ t any jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.09.2003 swedish pm blames big economies for euro weakness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last-minute criticism : swedish prime minister göran persson prime minister persson of sweden says europe 's biggest economies are responsible for the weakness of the eurozone .
that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .

" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .

they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.09.2003 swedish pm blames big economies for euro weakness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last-minute criticism : swedish prime minister göran persson prime minister persson of sweden says europe 's biggest economies are responsible for the weakness of the eurozone .
that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .
this time even more people will decide late because the issue is more complicated , " he told the financial times . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to violate deficit rules for second year the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .

“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .
the chancellor was apparently upset that his junior coalition could not decide whether it wanted to toe the government line or be an opposition party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany deliberates military role in iraq the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help .

wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .

" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .

he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .

german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments . the stuttgarter zeitung noted that german chancellor gerhard schröder chose weighty words for his turkish visitor when he told prime minister tayyip erdogan it was in germany ’ s national interest for his country to have closer european union ties .
erdogan appeared to hear this with " great satisfaction , " the paper wrote , since none of schröder ’ s predecessors have ever spoken out in favor of allowing turkey to join the eu .
the düsseldorf-based rheinische post opined on the reality of any serious political discussion about turkey in germany : it raises people ’ s blood pressure .
a lot of the arguments are overblown , the paper wrote , while others are swept under the carpet .
the government is annoyed that the opposition conservatives want to prevent turkey from joining the eu .
but what 's new about that , wonders the paper ?
" christian social union leader edmund stoiber made that very clear last december - he simply wanted a public debate on the issue which never occurred , " the paper wrote .
hanover ’ s neue presse dismissed the opposition conservative ’ s position on turkey as short-sighted .
" if their european policy 50 years ago had been as short-sighted , the eu may never have been created , " the paper ’ s editors opined .
" and germany would have had a much more difficult time finding its path in western politics .
the post-war conservative chancellor adenauer cemented germany ’ s position in the west and thereby secured its liberalization just the just as the conservative muslim erdogan is trying to do now .
one wishes he could have as courageous and clever partners as adenauer would have been , " the paper concluded .
dresden 's sächsiche zeitung pointed out that the eu - whether it fits into the screeching german conservatives plan or not - gave turkey a european perspective back in the 1960s and strengthened this by giving it official candidate status in 1999 .
the paper noted that more than one german conservative government played a role .
still , turkey still has much left to do in order to bring the country in line with the most important eu criteria .
two weeks after the mass-circulation bild newspaper published an article about " florida rolf , " a german living on welfare in florida , german social and health minister renate schmidt is tightening regulations .
the badische zeitung in freiburg noted that , despite all the hype , a mere 959 germans receive social welfare overseas – making up 0.024 percent of all those on benefits .
the paper added that " the majority of people receiving benefits overseas are single mothers fighting for custody of their children , prisoners who may be sitting wrongly accused in prison as well as the aged and ill who are unable to travel .
that the government is using its position to appear tough is more worrying , " the paper concludes .
the leipziger volkszeitung wrote that the 2.8 million people receiving welfare in germany can only dream of sunny florida .
" of course there are some people happy not to have to slog away at work or those attached to the bottle from dawn to dusk , there are thousands of those who would be happy just to have a job , " the paper opined , before underlining the real problem : which is that there aren ’ t any jobs .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .
indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .
by handing the germans lucrative business opportunities which will in turn help the united states get a grip on areas of reconstruction , washington would have some serious bargaining power with berlin over a new united nations resolution on iraq as well as a base for pushing for support for a possible nato deployment in the gulf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies get serious about iraq as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .
that 's a far larger percentage than many of our competitors .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .

they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .

he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .
the chancellor was apparently upset that his junior coalition could not decide whether it wanted to toe the government line or be an opposition party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany deliberates military role in iraq the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .
in a speech on wednesday erdogan said his government was in favor of prohibiting torture .
" we want to bring democracy in our country to its highest level , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : turkey needs a helping hand german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .
in a speech on wednesday erdogan said his government was in favor of prohibiting torture .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .
that 's a far larger percentage than many of our competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.09.2003 german industry confident of role in iraqi reconstruction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businessmen sought to create strategies for investing in iraq during a conference at petersberg palace .
the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .
indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .
by handing the germans lucrative business opportunities which will in turn help the united states get a grip on areas of reconstruction , washington would have some serious bargaining power with berlin over a new united nations resolution on iraq as well as a base for pushing for support for a possible nato deployment in the gulf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies get serious about iraq as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .
indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .
by handing the germans lucrative business opportunities which will in turn help the united states get a grip on areas of reconstruction , washington would have some serious bargaining power with berlin over a new united nations resolution on iraq as well as a base for pushing for support for a possible nato deployment in the gulf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies get serious about iraq as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond .

representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .
indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .
by handing the germans lucrative business opportunities which will in turn help the united states get a grip on areas of reconstruction , washington would have some serious bargaining power with berlin over a new united nations resolution on iraq as well as a base for pushing for support for a possible nato deployment in the gulf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies get serious about iraq as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.09.2003 are budget airlines killing the planet ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are cashing in on the budget travel craze , but are the eco costs too high ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .
that 's a far larger percentage than many of our competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.09.2003 are budget airlines killing the planet ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are cashing in on the budget travel craze , but are the eco costs too high ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .
that 's a far larger percentage than many of our competitors .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .

they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.09.2003 german press review : turkey needs a helping hand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has a long way to go toward democracy , but german papers conclude that western guidance would make that process move quicker .
german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments . the stuttgarter zeitung noted that german chancellor gerhard schröder chose weighty words for his turkish visitor when he told prime minister tayyip erdogan it was in germany ’ s national interest for his country to have closer european union ties .
erdogan appeared to hear this with " great satisfaction , " the paper wrote , since none of schröder ’ s predecessors have ever spoken out in favor of allowing turkey to join the eu .
the düsseldorf-based rheinische post opined on the reality of any serious political discussion about turkey in germany : it raises people ’ s blood pressure .
a lot of the arguments are overblown , the paper wrote , while others are swept under the carpet .
the government is annoyed that the opposition conservatives want to prevent turkey from joining the eu .
but what 's new about that , wonders the paper ?
" christian social union leader edmund stoiber made that very clear last december - he simply wanted a public debate on the issue which never occurred , " the paper wrote .
hanover ’ s neue presse dismissed the opposition conservative ’ s position on turkey as short-sighted .
" if their european policy 50 years ago had been as short-sighted , the eu may never have been created , " the paper ’ s editors opined .
" and germany would have had a much more difficult time finding its path in western politics .
the post-war conservative chancellor adenauer cemented germany ’ s position in the west and thereby secured its liberalization just the just as the conservative muslim erdogan is trying to do now .
one wishes he could have as courageous and clever partners as adenauer would have been , " the paper concluded .
dresden 's sächsiche zeitung pointed out that the eu - whether it fits into the screeching german conservatives plan or not - gave turkey a european perspective back in the 1960s and strengthened this by giving it official candidate status in 1999 .
the paper noted that more than one german conservative government played a role .
still , turkey still has much left to do in order to bring the country in line with the most important eu criteria .
two weeks after the mass-circulation bild newspaper published an article about " florida rolf , " a german living on welfare in florida , german social and health minister renate schmidt is tightening regulations .
the badische zeitung in freiburg noted that , despite all the hype , a mere 959 germans receive social welfare overseas – making up 0.024 percent of all those on benefits .
the paper added that " the majority of people receiving benefits overseas are single mothers fighting for custody of their children , prisoners who may be sitting wrongly accused in prison as well as the aged and ill who are unable to travel .
that the government is using its position to appear tough is more worrying , " the paper concludes .
the leipziger volkszeitung wrote that the 2.8 million people receiving welfare in germany can only dream of sunny florida .
" of course there are some people happy not to have to slog away at work or those attached to the bottle from dawn to dusk , there are thousands of those who would be happy just to have a job , " the paper opined , before underlining the real problem : which is that there aren ’ t any jobs .
and that , the paper noted , would be a much more important issue to solve than the outrage over rolf in florida . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .

meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .

he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.09.2003 are budget airlines killing the planet ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines are cashing in on the budget travel craze , but are the eco costs too high ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .
that 's a far larger percentage than many of our competitors .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .
this time even more people will decide late because the issue is more complicated , " he told the financial times . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to violate deficit rules for second year the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .
if eu budgetary limits are breeched next year , brussels may impose sanctions .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .
in a speech on wednesday erdogan said his government was in favor of prohibiting torture .
" we want to bring democracy in our country to its highest level , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : turkey needs a helping hand german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.09.2003 german press review : turkey needs a helping hand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has a long way to go toward democracy , but german papers conclude that western guidance would make that process move quicker .
german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments . the stuttgarter zeitung noted that german chancellor gerhard schröder chose weighty words for his turkish visitor when he told prime minister tayyip erdogan it was in germany ’ s national interest for his country to have closer european union ties .
erdogan appeared to hear this with " great satisfaction , " the paper wrote , since none of schröder ’ s predecessors have ever spoken out in favor of allowing turkey to join the eu .
the düsseldorf-based rheinische post opined on the reality of any serious political discussion about turkey in germany : it raises people ’ s blood pressure .
a lot of the arguments are overblown , the paper wrote , while others are swept under the carpet .
the government is annoyed that the opposition conservatives want to prevent turkey from joining the eu .
but what 's new about that , wonders the paper ?
" christian social union leader edmund stoiber made that very clear last december - he simply wanted a public debate on the issue which never occurred , " the paper wrote .
hanover ’ s neue presse dismissed the opposition conservative ’ s position on turkey as short-sighted .
" if their european policy 50 years ago had been as short-sighted , the eu may never have been created , " the paper ’ s editors opined .
" and germany would have had a much more difficult time finding its path in western politics .
the post-war conservative chancellor adenauer cemented germany ’ s position in the west and thereby secured its liberalization just the just as the conservative muslim erdogan is trying to do now .
one wishes he could have as courageous and clever partners as adenauer would have been , " the paper concluded .
dresden 's sächsiche zeitung pointed out that the eu - whether it fits into the screeching german conservatives plan or not - gave turkey a european perspective back in the 1960s and strengthened this by giving it official candidate status in 1999 .
the paper noted that more than one german conservative government played a role .
still , turkey still has much left to do in order to bring the country in line with the most important eu criteria .
two weeks after the mass-circulation bild newspaper published an article about " florida rolf , " a german living on welfare in florida , german social and health minister renate schmidt is tightening regulations .
the badische zeitung in freiburg noted that , despite all the hype , a mere 959 germans receive social welfare overseas – making up 0.024 percent of all those on benefits .
the paper added that " the majority of people receiving benefits overseas are single mothers fighting for custody of their children , prisoners who may be sitting wrongly accused in prison as well as the aged and ill who are unable to travel .
that the government is using its position to appear tough is more worrying , " the paper concludes .
the leipziger volkszeitung wrote that the 2.8 million people receiving welfare in germany can only dream of sunny florida .
" of course there are some people happy not to have to slog away at work or those attached to the bottle from dawn to dusk , there are thousands of those who would be happy just to have a job , " the paper opined , before underlining the real problem : which is that there aren ’ t any jobs .
and that , the paper noted , would be a much more important issue to solve than the outrage over rolf in florida . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders .

german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments . the stuttgarter zeitung noted that german chancellor gerhard schröder chose weighty words for his turkish visitor when he told prime minister tayyip erdogan it was in germany ’ s national interest for his country to have closer european union ties .
erdogan appeared to hear this with " great satisfaction , " the paper wrote , since none of schröder ’ s predecessors have ever spoken out in favor of allowing turkey to join the eu .
the düsseldorf-based rheinische post opined on the reality of any serious political discussion about turkey in germany : it raises people ’ s blood pressure .
a lot of the arguments are overblown , the paper wrote , while others are swept under the carpet .
the government is annoyed that the opposition conservatives want to prevent turkey from joining the eu .

dresden 's sächsiche zeitung pointed out that the eu - whether it fits into the screeching german conservatives plan or not - gave turkey a european perspective back in the 1960s and strengthened this by giving it official candidate status in 1999 .
the paper noted that more than one german conservative government played a role .
still , turkey still has much left to do in order to bring the country in line with the most important eu criteria .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .

german newspapers set their sights on conservatives opposed to future european union membership for turkey and the outrage over rolf , a man who lives in florida on his german welfare payments . the stuttgarter zeitung noted that german chancellor gerhard schröder chose weighty words for his turkish visitor when he told prime minister tayyip erdogan it was in germany ’ s national interest for his country to have closer european union ties .
erdogan appeared to hear this with " great satisfaction , " the paper wrote , since none of schröder ’ s predecessors have ever spoken out in favor of allowing turkey to join the eu .
the düsseldorf-based rheinische post opined on the reality of any serious political discussion about turkey in germany : it raises people ’ s blood pressure .
a lot of the arguments are overblown , the paper wrote , while others are swept under the carpet .
the government is annoyed that the opposition conservatives want to prevent turkey from joining the eu .
but what 's new about that , wonders the paper ?
" christian social union leader edmund stoiber made that very clear last december - he simply wanted a public debate on the issue which never occurred , " the paper wrote .
hanover ’ s neue presse dismissed the opposition conservative ’ s position on turkey as short-sighted .
" if their european policy 50 years ago had been as short-sighted , the eu may never have been created , " the paper ’ s editors opined .
" and germany would have had a much more difficult time finding its path in western politics .
the post-war conservative chancellor adenauer cemented germany ’ s position in the west and thereby secured its liberalization just the just as the conservative muslim erdogan is trying to do now .
one wishes he could have as courageous and clever partners as adenauer would have been , " the paper concluded .
dresden 's sächsiche zeitung pointed out that the eu - whether it fits into the screeching german conservatives plan or not - gave turkey a european perspective back in the 1960s and strengthened this by giving it official candidate status in 1999 .
the paper noted that more than one german conservative government played a role .
still , turkey still has much left to do in order to bring the country in line with the most important eu criteria .
two weeks after the mass-circulation bild newspaper published an article about " florida rolf , " a german living on welfare in florida , german social and health minister renate schmidt is tightening regulations .
the badische zeitung in freiburg noted that , despite all the hype , a mere 959 germans receive social welfare overseas – making up 0.024 percent of all those on benefits .
the paper added that " the majority of people receiving benefits overseas are single mothers fighting for custody of their children , prisoners who may be sitting wrongly accused in prison as well as the aged and ill who are unable to travel .
that the government is using its position to appear tough is more worrying , " the paper concludes .
the leipziger volkszeitung wrote that the 2.8 million people receiving welfare in germany can only dream of sunny florida .
" of course there are some people happy not to have to slog away at work or those attached to the bottle from dawn to dusk , there are thousands of those who would be happy just to have a job , " the paper opined , before underlining the real problem : which is that there aren ’ t any jobs .
and that , the paper noted , would be a much more important issue to solve than the outrage over rolf in florida . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .
indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .
by handing the germans lucrative business opportunities which will in turn help the united states get a grip on areas of reconstruction , washington would have some serious bargaining power with berlin over a new united nations resolution on iraq as well as a base for pushing for support for a possible nato deployment in the gulf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies get serious about iraq as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .

no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .

he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .
that 's a far larger percentage than many of our competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.09.2003 poland takes up iraq command as u.s. looks for more help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish maj. gen. andrzej tyszkiewicz -lrb- left -rrb- will command the multinational division .
poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .
but once tensions recede and some troops receive necessary equipment , najaf is likely to come under polish control in the coming weeks . “ our primary goal is the security of the zone under our control , ” said wiatrowski .
“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .
the chancellor was apparently upset that his junior coalition could not decide whether it wanted to toe the government line or be an opposition party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany deliberates military role in iraq the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help .
-lrb- august 21 , 2003 -rrb- blast casts shadow over u.n. role in iraq international condemnation of the attack on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad has been rapid and widespread , but the bombing has raised fears for the future of international peacekeeping in iraq .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the most low-emission aircraft on the market . " schoettes also hit back at the charge levelled by the campaign that low-cost airlines lure customers with promises of cheap flights when in fact , the cheap seats have often already been sold . " it 's absolute rubbish to say that .
we offer customers absolute price transparency , " he said .
" we have also been tested by the consumer protection association , which found at least 15 to 20 percent of all flights on our website are in the lowest price category .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .
this time even more people will decide late because the issue is more complicated , " he told the financial times . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to violate deficit rules for second year the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .

indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .
the trade relations of the past have left a deep impression on the iraqi people who have great respect for their country ’ s business links with germany .
“ the reputation of the germans in iraq is still very good , ” said abdul satar el bagdadi , vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in iraq .
“ as soon as the iraqi government has more autonomy , there will be more possibilities of new business with germany . ”
washington may need business partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation descends into further chaos .
with the situation in iraq continuing to deteriorate as coalition forces and the iraqi administration struggle to get the country back on its feet , washington may now welcome offers of industrial support .
regular attacks on occupation forces , terrorist bombings and sabotage of important utilities across the country have added to the impression that the economic and industrial transformation of iraq , on top of the security and stability of the country , appears to be beyond what the united states can handle on its own . it was originally believed within german industry , as in iraq , that companies from the united states and its coalition partners would have the inside track on business deals within the war-torn country .
but as the huge scale and cost of rebuilding becomes apparent , opportunities for german businesses in the areas of energy , construction , sewage systems and the development of new it services are likely to present themselves .
germany offers expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction is a massive task .
“ motorways , roads , building construction , the airport at basra or the electrical dam at mosul , all these projects could be handled by german businesses , ” said hans-dieter spohn , who responsible for arab states in the german economics ministry .
german companies are determined to get involved if opportunities arise .
more than 200 have signed up for a business conference in baghdad penciled in for november .
it is likely that the conference will address the opportunities arising from subcontracting work and the negotiations over the 40 large state-owned iraq authorities the u.s. authorities have earmarked for privatization .
improving ties the change in climate has set the wheels of german industry turning in preparation for a possible washington approved drive into iraq .
indeed , chancellor gerhard schröder is expected to meet u.s. president george w. bush at the united nations in new york later this month for their first private talks in a year .
industry experts in germany are confidently hoping that these talks will lead to a possible thawing of german-american relations - a development which could trigger a raft of contracts in iraq for german business . however , necessity may prove to be the mother of intervention .
by handing the germans lucrative business opportunities which will in turn help the united states get a grip on areas of reconstruction , washington would have some serious bargaining power with berlin over a new united nations resolution on iraq as well as a base for pushing for support for a possible nato deployment in the gulf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies get serious about iraq as the reconstruction of iraq begins in earnest , germany ’ s small and mid-sized companies prepare to reestablish old business ties in baghdad and beyond .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .
in a speech on wednesday erdogan said his government was in favor of prohibiting torture .

with assurances the german government will support his country 's candidacy for european union membership , turkish prime minister recep tayyip winds down a successful trip to germany . turkey got a huge push this week in its effort to join the european union .
during his three-day visit to berlin , turkish prime minister recep tayyip received an assurance from german chancellor gerhard schröder that his country would back ankara 's future membership .
" the expectations that have arisen -lsb- in turkey -rsb- can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder said after meeting with erdogan on tuesday , referring to the country 's efforts to join the eu .
meanwhile , schröder dismissed opposition politicians who have rejected the possibility of turkey 's accession to the eu as " cheap polemics . "
wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union and christian social union said tuesday that turkey 's admission could be " political suicide , " alledging that turkey 's membership would " overtax " the eu 's capacity for integration and hinder economic growth within the bloc .
no " christian club " erdogan warned that discussions of future turkish eu membership should n't spark domestic political battles in germany .
he said was " sad that some circles in germany have a skewed image of turkey . "
and he stressed on wednesday that turkey 's route into the eu , which has included introducing a slew of reforms regarding basic and human rights , was an " irrevocable process . " the eu is not a " christian club , " but rather a " political community of values , " erdogan stressed .
" the values that turkey has committed itself to are the values that form the basis of the western democracies , " the prime minister said .
he said europe would risk division if turkey were excluded from the eu . previously erdogan had called on turks in germany - at 2 million , the country 's largest minority - to apply for german citizenship in order to make integration easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leopard 2 tanks erdogan also called for germany to put an end to limitations on arms exports to turkey , a fellow member of nato , in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper .
he said the measures , which have stopped berlin from supplying turkey with battle tanks , should be suspended in view of turkey 's reforms and possible accession to the eu . human rights issues in their meeting on tuesday , erdogan and schröder confirmed their resolution to have radical islamic fundamentalist leader metin kaplan , known as the " caliph of cologne , " extradited to turkey .
a cologne court had rejected an application to deport the turkish national , who has been jailed on charges of inciting murder , because their was no guarantee he would receive a fair trial there and not be tortured . erdogan planned to meet with christian democratic party chairwoman angela merkel on wednesday afternoon before his departure from berlin to push the turkish case for eu entry with the skeptical political opposition .
he was also expected to meet with representatives from human rights organizations in berlin .
amnesty international and numerous other human rights groups have repeatedly accused turkey of systematic violations of human rights despite recent changes to turkish federal laws .

poland took over command of a section of iraq on wednesday , as the united states attempted to get more countries to join peacekeeping efforts with a new u.n. resolution .
but germany has said it still won ’ t send troops . in a ceremony in an amphitheater in the ancient city of babylon , u.s. marines relinquished control of south-central iraq to the region ’ s new polish commander .
warsaw will now direct a force of around 9,000 international troops in what is being seen as crucial test of poland ’ s desire to play a greater role in world affairs . “ we aren ’ t just being greeted , we are rather being celebrated euphorically , ” polish military spokesman andrzej wiatrowski told deutsche welle , referring to how the iraqis apparently did not consider the poles foreign occupiers . the handover from u.s. to polish command comes just as u.s. president george bush is hoping a new united nations resolution will convince even more nations to contribute to peacekeeping efforts in iraq .
washington sees the so-called multinational division with soldiers from 21 countries including poland , ukraine and spain under polish major general andrzej tyszkiewicz as key to stabilizing the country and taking pressure off u.s. troops . “ the message is that the international community is committed to the country of iraq , to its people and to the world – to never allow the saddam hussein regime to return and to bring peace and stability to this country and this region , ” lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , commander of the u.s.-led task force in iraq , told reuters . u.s. to stay in najaf the u.s. forces have delayed handing over part of the south-central zone to the international troops surrounding the city of najaf following the deadly car bomb that killed a leading shi ’ ite cleric and around 80 other people on friday .

“ the people need access to electricity and water ; furthermore humanitarian aid must get to where it is needed . ” poland and other nations contributing to the division have been a staunch supporters of the united states in its efforts to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but washington would like to get other countries involved in peacekeeping .
but india , pakistan , turkey among others have been loath to get involved unless the united nations is given more authority in reconstruction efforts . however , the bombing of the u.n. headquarters in baghdad last month , which resulted in the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others , has raised serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . a new u.n. security council resolution is likely to call for a unified multinational peacekeeping mission under command of the u.s. military .
but it remains unclear whether that would be enough to convince war skeptics to send troops to iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly said he would not send german soldiers to iraq , regardless whether there was un backing or not , contending germany is playing its part in the war against international terrorism by having thousands of troops in afghanistan and elsewhere abroad . schröder on tuesday reportedly said he was “ sickened ” by recent comments by greens co-leader angelika beer , who said that germany could soon send troops to iraq if their deployment was covered by a united nations resolution .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .

the german-iraqi business day conference ended in bonn on tuesday with both sides optimistic that the trade links of the past could be revived and new opportunities forged for german industry in iraq . experts from diverse sectors of german industry met with iraqi contacts old and new at a one-day business conference in bonn on tuesday to discuss future possibilities for german small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in post-war iraq .
representatives from around 100 german companies and members of the iraqi chamber of commerce and industry were present at the german-iraqi business day discussion to assess ways of opening up trade and business relations once again .
prior to the first gulf war and the imposition of a trading embargo in 1990 , germany was iraq ’ s most important trading partner .
initial signs from the meeting in bonn indicated optimism on both sides that the business relationship can flourish once more - as soon as iraq 's painful process of economic and industrial reconstruction gets underway in earnest .
but getting iraq to a level of stability where trade and industry can begin to grow will be neither quick nor easy .
while officials from both sides seem agreed on the resurrection of german-iraqi business links and the commitment to restart trade between the two countries , some feel that they face a powerful obstacle : the business interests of the united states and its coalition partners .
u.s. barrier to business in iraq “ with the americans as the occupying force , there are no great business deals to make , ” said gelan khulusi , the chief of the german-iraqi association for smes .
“ that is , until there ’ s a new iraqi government in the saddle . ”
but khulusi did see the silver lining on the iraqi business cloud , viewing the ever-changing hazards in his country as a possibility for less u.s. influence on iraq ’ s industrial future .
" the chances have increased enormously , " he said , referring to the prospects for german industry in iraq 's rebuilding contracts .

that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .
this time even more people will decide late because the issue is more complicated , " he told the financial times . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to violate deficit rules for second year the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .

the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .

the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .

" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.09.2003 swedish pm blames big economies for euro weakness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last-minute criticism : swedish prime minister göran persson prime minister persson of sweden says europe 's biggest economies are responsible for the weakness of the eurozone .
that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum . swedish prime minister göran persson has found a scapegoat in the event his countrymen and women vote against introducing the euro in two weeks .
the social democrat lashed out at germany , france and italy for preparing poorly for the euro and damaging the eurozone economy .
" if they had behaved as sweden , finland , the uk and others during the 1990s , preparing their economies for the downturn , we should not have had this situation today , " persson told the financial times .
france , germany and italy make up around 60 percent of the eurozone economy .
persson may be cobbling together a program of damage control in the event that swedish voters reject the euro in a referendum on september 14 .
right now , the " no " votes have a comfortable lead , although there are still many undecided voters .
though his cabinet has been divided on the issue , the prime minister has not wavered in his support of the euro .
but the swedish " no " camp , which has been in first place for months , has seized on the sluggish economic performance of the eurozone 's largest economies to bolster its case against the euro .
they say sweden would be better off sticking with its present currency , the crown .
problems compounded persson 's worries have been aggravated by reports that both france and germany are expected to breach the european union 's budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of gdp for the third consecutive year in 2004 .
the limit , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was introduced to protect the euro .
the french government announced on monday that its budget deficit would reach 4 percent .
berlin reckons on a deficit of 3.8 percent this year , while german finance minister hans eichel has expressed confidence that the country will not overshoot the 3 percent mark in 2004 .
but german central bank head , ernst welteke , contradicted the optimistic finance minister on monday .
he said the german economy 's persistent weakness meant the country would likely not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
with the new figures from paris , the european commission expects the eurozone as a whole to have a deficit of at least 3 percent , a spokesman for eu commissioner for economic and monetary pedro solbes said on tuesday .
damage control the stability pact may be the key to allowing euro-fan persson to limit the damage if the swedes say " no " to the euro .
he suggested on friday sweden could delay introducing the common currency - planned for 2006 - even if a majority of swedes vote for it in the referendum .
a " functioning stability pact " was a prerequisite for launching the euro in sweden , he said in an interview .
a poll published by the swedish polling institute skop on tuesday showed that 49 percent of swedes were against the euro and 39 percent in favor of its introduction .
twelve percent were still undecided .
persson is banking on this last group voting yes .
" we know from the eu referendum in 1994 that 32 percent decided how to vote in the last week .
it gave a net contribution to the ' yes ' side of five percentage points .
this time even more people will decide late because the issue is more complicated , " he told the financial times . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to violate deficit rules for second year the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .

they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign . there was a time , not so long ago , when air travel was the domain of the at least moderately well-to-do .
that was before the birth of budget airlines , whose revolutionary fare structures allowed passengers to fly off to a sunny isle for the weekend or do some european city hopping at extremely low cost . fewer germans may be flying than ever before , but those that are , are flying budget .
no frills airlines like ryanair , germania , germanwings , air berlin and hapag-lloyd express are cashing in with offers to fly all over europe as well as within germany for as little as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- . hahn airport , where many of germany 's budget flights take off and land , saw over a million travellers pass through its gates in 2002 , an 81 percent increase over the previous year . in august alone , two million passengers flew between various european destinations with irish no-frills airline ryanair . but the promise of über-cheap tickets and easy on-line or telephone booking has n't impressed germany 's environmental lobby .
they say the no-frills boom has made air traffic germany 's " climate killer no .
1 . "
they are launching a major awareness-raising campaign this week to encourage people to get out of the jet and hop onto the train . let the train , not the plane , take the strain a coalition of german environmental and related groups - including bund , forest-protection league robin wood , environmentalists germanwatch , the travel club of germany -lrb- vcd -rrb- and the german association against aircraft noise - have joined forces for a campaign which will be launched on thursday in the city of düsseldorf .
the marketing campaign is all about advising holiday makers to think twice before they jump on a plane . " we want people to ask themselves : is it worth it ?
perhaps it would be better for the environment to take the car or the train , " helmer pless , travel expert at the travel club of germany , told deutsche welle . greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft are three times higher than those emitted by cars . " a plane emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at a much higher level .
at such heights , it does far more damage then exhaust fumes from cars , because they emit fumes at ground level , " pless said . the complaints by the environmentalists are backed up by the german government .
the federal environment office says the increase in air traffic over germany 's skies and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions will increase the damage done to the ozone layer by 2030 by a factor of three . the vcd hopes that the leaflet campaign will encourage more holiday makers to take the train instead .
" it 's the most environmentally-friendly alternative , " pless said . the vcd is independent of germany 's railway system , deutsche bahn . misleading ads according to the campaign organizers , it 's not just the environment that is paying a heavy price for the no-frills airline boom .
consumers often do n't know all the costs that are involved and wind up paying more than they expected , according to pless .
advertising offering flights at next-to-nothing prices can mislead consumers . " the number of seats that are available at these prices are often very limited , " pless says .
" the prices always include other , hidden costs . " the no-frills critics have asked germany 's antitrust office to check whether the advertising is legal . the campaign is also directed at the german government , which continues to subsidize airplane fuel prices , as do other countries .
according to bund , the subsidies make it easy for the low-cost airlines to continue to make profit , while the trains lose out .
a report the organization recently put out said the tax breaks on fuel mean airlines are able to sell a ticket from berlin to munich for at least € 16 less than the rail system can . one airline answers the charges the press spokesman for the no-frills flyer germanwings , hans-joachim schoettes , defended his company 's environmental record .
he said the company , unlike some others , uses modern aircraft with up-to-date pollution controls . " we only use airbus 320 and airbus 319 planes , " he told deutsche welle .

changes to the way the downing street press office is run were urgently needed , says a former labour spin doctor .
benn wegg-prosser , who was an advisor to former cabinet minister peter mandelson , said the hutton inquiry into the death of the scientist dr david kelly had shown how much the government had to address the way it was getting its message across .
there were three main lessons to be learnt from the past few weeks ' events , he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
firstly , the rapid advance of technology and the speed with which news now travels mean off-the-record briefings to journalists are " a throwback to an outdated era and should come to an end " , he said .
" they were always used as a way of promoting a policy in advance of its coming out or a way of cutting off a potentially damaging story by shifting attention from one area to another .
" these types of briefings were always given on the basis of trust - but what 's changed is large numbers of people who cover politics are no longer prepared to treat those briefings as private .

" the advance in communications methods means you ca n't really keep such briefings private in the way you used to - mobiles , pagers and the internet have seen to that . "
the second element , according to mr wegg-prosser , is on-camera briefings , like those held at the white house .
" the downing street official spokesman should be doing press briefings live on television , " he said .
web sleight thirdly , he said the government 's use of technology to present information to the public should be addressed .
" the downing street website is n't very good and government department 's websites in general are still miles behind corporate websites .
" but the hutton inquiry website has provided a huge amount of information to the public and it should be a model for the government to follow , " he said .
the hutton inquiry website offers around 6,000 pages of evidence including emails , notes and memos and has published a plethora of sensitive documents surrounding the affair .

changes to the way the downing street press office is run were urgently needed , says a former labour spin doctor .
benn wegg-prosser , who was an advisor to former cabinet minister peter mandelson , said the hutton inquiry into the death of the scientist dr david kelly had shown how much the government had to address the way it was getting its message across .
there were three main lessons to be learnt from the past few weeks ' events , he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
firstly , the rapid advance of technology and the speed with which news now travels mean off-the-record briefings to journalists are " a throwback to an outdated era and should come to an end " , he said .
" they were always used as a way of promoting a policy in advance of its coming out or a way of cutting off a potentially damaging story by shifting attention from one area to another .
" these types of briefings were always given on the basis of trust - but what 's changed is large numbers of people who cover politics are no longer prepared to treat those briefings as private .
government department websites are still miles behind corporate websites benn wegg-prosser , former government spin doctor shake up in no 10 press office " this paired with a communications leap in the past few years means their value is now of less significance , " he said .
" the advance in communications methods means you ca n't really keep such briefings private in the way you used to - mobiles , pagers and the internet have seen to that . "
the second element , according to mr wegg-prosser , is on-camera briefings , like those held at the white house .
" the downing street official spokesman should be doing press briefings live on television , " he said .
web sleight thirdly , he said the government 's use of technology to present information to the public should be addressed .
" the downing street website is n't very good and government department 's websites in general are still miles behind corporate websites .
" but the hutton inquiry website has provided a huge amount of information to the public and it should be a model for the government to follow , " he said .
the hutton inquiry website offers around 6,000 pages of evidence including emails , notes and memos and has published a plethora of sensitive documents surrounding the affair .
the traffic measurement company hitwise reported the official hutton inquiry website was the most visited political website in the uk in july .

the islay single malt - which had been expected to sell for around £ 3,000 - sold for £ 9,200 with buyer 's premium .
bidders from france , japan , italy and holland vied for the bottle at the sale , in mctear 's auction house , glasgow .
but it was the distiller which created the tipple , morrison bowmore , which bid the highest .
the cash will go to the distiller 's chosen charity , the children 's hospice association scotland -lrb- chas -rrb- .
chas hopes to raise £ 10m to open its second scottish hospice , robin house in argyll and bute , next year .
bob tomlinson , of chas , said : " it 's absolutely superb that bowmore have generously made this donation , we 're over the moon . "
the bottle was casked in the presence of the queen during her 1980 visit to the bowmore distillery on the southern hebridean island of islay .
the cask was poured into 648 bottles last year to mark the queen 's golden jubilee - her majesty allowed bottle 631 to be auctioned for the hospice .
whisky consultant martin green , who organised the sale , said : " i 'm delighted we were able to exceed the estimated price and raise money for chas . "
record sale among the 2,000 bottles of whisky sold were six which were salvaged from a 19th century shipwreck off the coast of stranraer .
the bottles , which were retrieved from the wreck of cargo ship the firth of cromarty , which sank in 1898 , all fetched between £ 250 and £ 300 .
bowmore had hoped the sale of its single malt might beat the top price ever fetched for a bottle of whisky , which stands at more than £ 25,000 .
the 62-year-old dalmore , also a single malt , which was bottled in alness , ross-shire , fetched £ 25,877.50 at mctear 's in december last year .
chas has several high-profile scots who support its bid to build a second hospice including film star ewan mcgregor and texas singer sharleen spiteri .

whisky consultant martin green , who organised the sale , said : " i 'm delighted we were able to exceed the estimated price and raise money for chas . "
record sale among the 2,000 bottles of whisky sold were six which were salvaged from a 19th century shipwreck off the coast of stranraer .
the bottles , which were retrieved from the wreck of cargo ship the firth of cromarty , which sank in 1898 , all fetched between £ 250 and £ 300 .
bowmore had hoped the sale of its single malt might beat the top price ever fetched for a bottle of whisky , which stands at more than £ 25,000 .
the 62-year-old dalmore , also a single malt , which was bottled in alness , ross-shire , fetched £ 25,877.50 at mctear 's in december last year .
chas has several high-profile scots who support its bid to build a second hospice including film star ewan mcgregor and texas singer sharleen spiteri .

your mission is to overthrow a ruthless dictator but the writings of elias canetti about the nature of power are behind a complex and ambitious game called republic : the revolution , which has just gone on sale in the uk .
republic is a strategy simulation game that puts you in the role of a budding revolutionary , out to overthrow a despotic and corrupt regime .

we boiled it down to three ways to win the game , force , money and influence demis hassabis , elixir studios " i wanted the player to feel what it was like to be che guevara , " explained demis hassabis , the creator of republic , " to evoke those emotions in a player . "
the title crosses traditional genres , combining elements of real-time strategy games with simulation games like simcity .
using a specially developed graphics engine , players can look over detailed cityscapes and zoom in on individual characters .
getting the mix of strategy and simulation just right was a slow and painstaking affair .
republic took an average of 25 people just over four years to complete .
mr hassabis told bbc news online that " many , many times " he felt as if they were not going to succeed , because of the problems of combining two game genres he has a great deal riding on the game , which is the first title by his company , elixir studios .
complicated scenario the game makers spent a lot of time trying to work out how to convey complex political ideology to gamers .
" i read a lot of revolutionary books during the making of the game , in particular crowds and power , " said mr hassabis , " it looks at issues of mob role and power . "
learn how to use crowds to your advantage the work by the bulgarian-born british citizen elias canetti influenced the behaviour of the crowds in the game .
some ideas had to be discarded as they proved too complicated for a computer game .
" we boiled it down to three ways to win the game , force , money and influence , " said mr hassabis .
players can manipulate , threaten , bribe or defame their way to power .
but he is pleased with the result , arguing that the sociological model in the game is " as realistic as has been achieved so far " .
elixir are even talking to academics about how the artificial intelligence behind the game could be used for research purposes .
the political complexity means that republic has a steep learning curve that could deter the casual gamer .
elixir admitted it might not be everyone 's cup of tea .
" it takes a bit of time to get into , " admitted mr hassabis .
" the control system is quite intuitive but the interface is very different to other games .
" i hope it is not so complicated that people wo n't get into it , " he said .
" i hope it does well enough that we can carry on with developing it . "

after prolonged defiance of us demands for reform , china 's central bank governor , zhou xiaochuan , has conceded that the yuan 's value will eventually be set by the market .
but he gave no timetable for liberalising the currency , and said there was still considerable room for debate about foreign exchange policy .
the yuan is currently pegged at 8.3 to the us dollar , a rate that most outside observers feel gives china an unfair advantage in the export market .
mr zhou 's conciliatory remarks came at the end of a tense visit to beijing by us treasury secretary john snow , who had been pushing for an upward revaluation of the yuan .
holding back change mr snow , under pressure at home amid growing discontent about china 's competitive advantage , said he was " encouraged " by the announcement .
mr snow is under pressure at home but he admitted that mr zhou 's comment was little more than a reiteration of previous policy .
china has resisted any significant change to the dollar peg , since a cheap currency has helped underpin the country 's export-driven boom .
beijing is concerned that any move to make china less competitive could cost jobs in rural areas , where the economy has long been less secure than in the large cities .
some economists have also pointed out that making the yuan fully convertible could bring in too many potentially destabilising flows of capital , of the sort that triggered a financial crisis in other parts of asia in 1997-98 .

china 's advantage in international markets has angered many in the us , who point to the $ 103bn deficit america has in trade with china .
a number of reports recently have blamed an overvalued dollar for job losses in us export-oriented manufacturing - and the position vis-a-vis some asian currencies is regarded as particularly acutely misaligned .
according to some calculations , the yuan should be revalued 40 % higher , in order to restore balance to international markets .
but the chinese have argued that washington should do more to boost its own exports , rather than pressuring other countries to solve the problem via exchange rates .
mr zhou said it was still too early to tell whether exchange rates were at inappropriate levels .

previous attempts to join the national farmers union -lrb- nfu -rrb- and the fuw have failed .
but now bob parry , who stood down from leading the fuw in june , has called for discussions to start straight away .
the two unions have been competing since 1955 , when the fuw split from the nfu .
but there is a growing feeling that , with the number of farmers declining , a single union may be able to do more for its members .
mr parry said that the two present unions should be dissolved and a new union be formed to represent the interests of farmers . "
i believe it will happen , but it is not something that will happen overnight " bob parry " by bringing all the talent that you have got in the two unions together , you would have a much stronger union in wales than you have got in the rest of the uk , " he said .
" farming numbers are going down at a very very high rate - in a number of years there wo n't be an option to join together .
" they should join while both unions are strong and are in a negotiating position .
" i believe it will happen , but it is not something that will happen overnight . "
mr parry said that the two unions had worked very closely together through the recent bse and foot-and-mouth crises .
he added that nfu cymru had started developing its own welsh policies , meaning it has come more directly in competition with the fuw .
the president of nfu cymru peredur hughes has said he is more than willing to discuss the possibility .
however , the final decision about any merger will rest with ordinary union members .
mr parry , who had led the fuw for 12 years , was succeeded as president by gareth vaughan , 61 , who farms in dolfor , near newtown , in mid wales , earlier this year .

plymouth city council admitted its children and families service department had " sunk as far as it can go " after government inspectors issued a highly critical report which found some children on the at-risk register in the city did not have an allocated social worker .
the council hopes a team of consultants due to arrive later in the year will help bring about radical improvements .
but the local branch of public sector workers ' union , unison , said the involvement of such teams in other parts of the country have only led to more cutbacks .
tackling problems the critical report came from the social services inspectorate , which visited plymouth in may .
it concluded the children 's service was not serving people well .
however , the report did say it was happy with the way the authority was aiming to tackle the problem .
councillor chris pattison , who is responsible for social services , said : " the government is saying our plans are good , our management is good and our leadership has taken us into a new direction and taking us forward .
the number of children without social workers has been halved " we 're in a process to trying to turn this ship around to take us from where we are today and taking us to where we want to be , which would be a two-star authority in two years ' time and excellent in three . "
since the report was compiled , the number of non-allocated children has halved .
but it is still considered to be a very serious problem .
but the branch chair of unison , tony staunton , said several years worth of cuts to the social services budget are really to blame .
he said : " the reality is that children 's services are in such a terrible state because there are n't the resources in place in plymouth . "
the consultancy team is due to arrive in october and the council hopes to see improvements within six months .

anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- absos -rrb- are designed to prevent behaviour including theft , intimidation , drunkenness and violence by individuals and families who make life difficult for their communities .
the orders , which have been available in england and wales since april 1999 , often include restrictions on entering a geographical area or shop and can also include bans on specific acts , such as swearing in public .
effective for a minimum of two years , absos are civil orders rather than criminal penalties and are handled by police and local authorities working in partnership .
breaches are punishable by up to five years in prison .
sid mcdowell said introducing the orders in northern ireland would make a big difference to people 's lives .
" this kind of action would be taken as the result of a decision in the magistrates court , " he said .
" the attraction is that it is a civil remedy , but if there is a breach , the criminal law can come into effect .
" therefore it can be enacted quickly and speedily , and improve the quality of life for people as a result . "
asbos were a key part of the crime and disorder act -lrb- 1998 -rrb- in england and wales , and were strengthened and extended by the police reform act 2002 .

if those signs are in a language you do not understand though , life for the traveller can be tricky .
so us researchers have come up with a prototype camera that does away with phrase books and translates signs almost instantly using the internet .
it combines a pocket computer , a digital camera and a wireless internet connection .
see and snap phrase books and dictionaries are already becoming increasingly redundant with the growing popularity of gadgets which translate as you talk or type .
the hp researchers however , recognised sign posts in a different language can be trickier to translate .
being unable to pronounce the words correctly can mean you could end up with a very different meaning .
dr howard taub , director of the printing and imaging research centre at hp labs in paolo alto in california let go digital , the bbc world service radio programme , try out their sign recognition and translation system .
this is really the advantage right now of using the internet .
the internet has got software on it to do all sorts of translations so from spanish , russian , to french dr howard taub , hp labs the idea is that by using a wireless connection to the internet , the device can be a handy camera which makes use of translation resources on the net .
" you do n't have to do anything else but look at a sign you do n't understand and shoot a picture of it , a very natural thing to do , " said dr taub .
" in one nice package it is an ipaq handheld computer and plugged into it is a camera attachment to it , so it can start to act like a digital camera .
" there is also a little wireless card plugged into it as well so i can communicate through the network .
" i can send the bits of information up somewhere so it can be processed in some way from the handheld device , " he explained .
after taking the picture of the sign , it will appear on the camera 's display with the translation , having looked it up on the internet through a wireless connection .
it will also translate virtually any language , according to dr taub and it makes the process of understanding something a lot quicker and more convenient .
" one of the advantages of all of this is that i am not translating words .
i could have my translating dictionary with me and pull out individual words .
" but the fact is the computer can handle phrases and sentences and eventually it will handle whole paragraphs , " said dr taub .
for example , it will soon be able to handle a translation of a plaque at a historical site , something which would be much harder to do using just a dictionary .
telling the difference the researchers say the prototype 's " imaging processing magic " is able to handle multiple languages too .
road signs can be hard to translate using a dictionary if the tourist comes across lots of signs in many languages , the device knows what letters should look like and so can sort out which language it is .
if it is not a real word , then the device can exclude it .
" this is really the advantage right now of using the internet .
the internet has got software on it to do all sorts of translations so from spanish , russian , to french .
" you name it , you can find websites that have free software and services to do any of those translations . "
although it is cleverly able to tell what are words and what are letters , it still might have problems translating certain abbreviations .
it also still relies on the user being near a wi-fi " hotspot " , an area which allows you to connect to the internet without having to plug a cable into your computer .

sponsored by t-online , backed by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt , and with a top prize of £ 10,000 , the women mean business awards promise to be a suitably glamorous occasion .
it was a major confidence boost to be nominated lucy sage , entrepreneur the 10 finalists , who have founded successful businesses ranging from a fruit juice supplier to a recruitment firm , were chosen for their entrepreneurial flair , fighting off stiff competition from hundreds of other nominees .
but some businesswomen feel that with successful female entrepreneurs now numerous enough to have lost their rarity value , the time is fast approaching when such women-only award schemes should be scrapped .
measuring up they argue that women entrepreneurs have nothing left to prove , and should now be judged on their merits alongside their male counterparts .
there is a lingering feeling also that women-only award ceremonies are in some sense patronising .
" -lsb- women-only awards -rsb- have been done to death .
we should compete equally with men , " declares eileen woutersz , president of the british association of women entrepreneurs .
it is certainly true that female entrepreneurs are more visible than ever before .
scarcely a week goes by that one of the uk 's national newspapers does not profile a female small business prodigy such as michelle mone , creator of the top-selling ultimo bra , or coffee republic co-founder sahar hashemi .
but other businesswomen retort that the recent proliferation of female entrepreneurial role models should not be mistaken as a sign that women now enjoy as easy a route into business as men .
they believe that since women still face particular obstacles in getting their businesses off the ground - a common problem is convincing their -lrb- male -rrb- bank managers to take them seriously - successful female entrepreneurs deserve particular recognition .
and even if they do have reservations about women-only award schemes , businesswomen who are nominated to them find the experience overwhelmingly positive .
confidence boost lucy sage , founder and principal of the newcastle-based sage academy for the performing arts , was the runner-up in a female entrepreneurship award for the north-east region last year .
" part of me wondered why we had to have a women-only shortlist , " she admits .
" but it was a major confidence boost to be nominated .
i had started my business when i was still in my mid 20s , and i think a lot of people thought i was biting off more than i could chew . "
confidence is key to business success , and some experts believe that the morale boost women gain from having their entrepreneurial achievements recognised should outweigh all other considerations .
for professor susan vinnicombe , professor of organisational behaviour at cranfield school of management , women 's apparent success at setting up their own businesses is at odds with their continued exclusion from britain 's big corporate boardrooms .
she is hopeful that businesswomen , if sufficiently encouraged , could build on their entrepreneurial success to blaze their way into the upper echelons of british industry .
" on one level , -lsb- women-only award schemes -rsb- are like a quota system , so in principle i 'm opposed to them , " says susan vinnicombe , professor of organisational behaviour at cranfield school of management .
" but on the other hand , progress just is n't happening in this country , " she says .

it was a major confidence boost to be nominated lucy sage , entrepreneur the 10 finalists , who have founded successful businesses ranging from a fruit juice supplier to a recruitment firm , were chosen for their entrepreneurial flair , fighting off stiff competition from hundreds of other nominees .
but some businesswomen feel that with successful female entrepreneurs now numerous enough to have lost their rarity value , the time is fast approaching when such women-only award schemes should be scrapped .

" part of me wondered why we had to have a women-only shortlist , " she admits .
" but it was a major confidence boost to be nominated .
i had started my business when i was still in my mid 20s , and i think a lot of people thought i was biting off more than i could chew . "
confidence is key to business success , and some experts believe that the morale boost women gain from having their entrepreneurial achievements recognised should outweigh all other considerations .
for professor susan vinnicombe , professor of organisational behaviour at cranfield school of management , women 's apparent success at setting up their own businesses is at odds with their continued exclusion from britain 's big corporate boardrooms .
she is hopeful that businesswomen , if sufficiently encouraged , could build on their entrepreneurial success to blaze their way into the upper echelons of british industry .
" on one level , -lsb- women-only award schemes -rsb- are like a quota system , so in principle i 'm opposed to them , " says susan vinnicombe , professor of organisational behaviour at cranfield school of management .
