the terrorist group could strike at any time in any place , including right here in germany . the editorial page of the hamburg-based financial times deutschland on friday considered the latest reminder from interior minister otto schily that germany remains under threat from al qaeda .

the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .

germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .
" we had a basic disagreement , " powell told german television channel zdf friday morning , adding that the two countries needed to " move on . "
" one way to get started is to begin cooperation on such issues as the u.n. resolution , " powell said .

the terrorist group could strike at any time in any place , including right here in germany . the editorial page of the hamburg-based financial times deutschland on friday considered the latest reminder from interior minister otto schily that germany remains under threat from al qaeda .
" schily was right to make the point , " the paper opined , " because despite the bloody attacks in bali and djerba , germans have become complacent .
the fanatic suicide attackers are too far away , sept .
11 , 2001 , was too long ago .
the truth is that no one here is safe from acts of terrorism .
leading al qaeda fighters lived in germany for years , and according to intelligence officials , some are still here . "
the government has a responsibility to keep the threat of terrorism in the public consciousness , the paper concluded .
meanwhile , the berliner kurier remained unconvinced by reassurances from security officials that there are no indications of a terrorist attack here in germany .
" there were n't any warnings for what happened in djerba or riyadh either , " the paper wrote , adding : " the sad truth is that it could happen anywhere .

the terrorist group could strike at any time in any place , including right here in germany . the editorial page of the hamburg-based financial times deutschland on friday considered the latest reminder from interior minister otto schily that germany remains under threat from al qaeda .
" schily was right to make the point , " the paper opined , " because despite the bloody attacks in bali and djerba , germans have become complacent .
the fanatic suicide attackers are too far away , sept .

the truth is that no one here is safe from acts of terrorism .
leading al qaeda fighters lived in germany for years , and according to intelligence officials , some are still here . "
the government has a responsibility to keep the threat of terrorism in the public consciousness , the paper concluded .
meanwhile , the berliner kurier remained unconvinced by reassurances from security officials that there are no indications of a terrorist attack here in germany .
" there were n't any warnings for what happened in djerba or riyadh either , " the paper wrote , adding : " the sad truth is that it could happen anywhere .
al qaeda 's fighters are all over the world , prepared to kill .
there 's a very fine line between the necessary communication of important information , and panic-inducement .
but pretending there 's no danger does n't help anyone , " warned the paper .
berlin 's die welt commented on the release of six german tourists who were kidnapped in algeria .
" together with 11 hostages from other european countries , their frightening drama came to an end .
but there is no cause for joy yet , " the paper wrote , " because the fate of the 15 other hostages , including 10 germans , is still unclear .
no one should say that it 's the tourists ' fault anymore , that they are victims of their own thirst for adventure , " the paper noted .
" if it 's truly the case that terrorists are responsible for the kidnappings , then this is no protest against excessive tourism , it 's another attack in the crazy war against the west . "

the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .
" we had a basic disagreement , " powell told german television channel zdf friday morning , adding that the two countries needed to " move on . "
" one way to get started is to begin cooperation on such issues as the u.n. resolution , " powell said .
security in afghanistan discussed following discussions the two had on germany 's presence as part of the international security assistance force in kabul , schröder told reporters that the government would review whether the force should be expanded beyond afghanistan 's capital . the country remains dangerously unstable more than a year after u.s. forces removed the taliban from power . germany currently has 2,500 soldiers stationed in kabul .
berlin will be on the highest possible security alert during the duration of powell 's visit , which will end early friday evening .

the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .
" we had a basic disagreement , " powell told german television channel zdf friday morning , adding that the two countries needed to " move on . "
" one way to get started is to begin cooperation on such issues as the u.n. resolution , " powell said .

the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .
" we had a basic disagreement , " powell told german television channel zdf friday morning , adding that the two countries needed to " move on . "
" one way to get started is to begin cooperation on such issues as the u.n. resolution , " powell said .
security in afghanistan discussed following discussions the two had on germany 's presence as part of the international security assistance force in kabul , schröder told reporters that the government would review whether the force should be expanded beyond afghanistan 's capital . the country remains dangerously unstable more than a year after u.s. forces removed the taliban from power . germany currently has 2,500 soldiers stationed in kabul .
berlin will be on the highest possible security alert during the duration of powell 's visit , which will end early friday evening .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2003 powell to germany : " we will stand together " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder on their way to the press conference friday colin powell and chancellor gerhard schröder held " deep " and " candid " talks that lasted a half-hour in berlin on friday morning .
the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .
" we had a basic disagreement , " powell told german television channel zdf friday morning , adding that the two countries needed to " move on . "
" one way to get started is to begin cooperation on such issues as the u.n. resolution , " powell said .
security in afghanistan discussed following discussions the two had on germany 's presence as part of the international security assistance force in kabul , schröder told reporters that the government would review whether the force should be expanded beyond afghanistan 's capital . the country remains dangerously unstable more than a year after u.s. forces removed the taliban from power . germany currently has 2,500 soldiers stationed in kabul .
berlin will be on the highest possible security alert during the duration of powell 's visit , which will end early friday evening .
more than 1,000 additional police officers have been called for duty on friday and police snipers have been posted around powell 's high-security hotel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's visit to berlin radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2003 germany pledges help to u.s. in security council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell said he and fischer can always " speak their hearts and minds to one another " chancellor gerhard schröder and his foreign minister told colin powell that germany will work with the u.s. to reach a compromise on a controversial postwar iraq resolution before the u.n. security council . in separate meetings with germany 's top two leaders , u.s. secretary of state colin powell got berlin 's pledge to help reach a compromise on a u.n. postwar resolution in the security council next week . powell , who left berlin at around 5 p.m.
friday , completed a one-day visit which covered everything from healing the german-u.s. rift of the past year to the roadmap to peace in the middle east . he received chancellor gerhard schröder 's promise that his government would work with the united states towards lifting the u.n. sanctions currently placed on iraq in the security council next week . but berlin stopped short of offering full support to a u.s.-british-spanish resolution before the security council , which washington wants a vote on next week . france and russia have expressed skepticism about the proposal , which gives the u.s. and great britain a major say in the iraqi oil industry and is vague on the duties of a possible u.n. coordinator in iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer , who has a close working relationship with powell , said after their afternoon meeting that the resolution was " a good basis " from which to work from . " we have an interest in reaching agreement , " fischer told reporters .

powell is in the german capital to discuss the german-u.s. relations .
-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the meetings were the first high-level meetings between german and american officials in berlin since president george w. bush 's 23-hour visit last may .
since then , the german and american relationship has undergone a radical transformation .
schröder 's refusal to support the bush administration 's plans to invade iraq virtually shut down contact between the two leaders in recent months . powell 's visit was greeted in germany as a positive first step to getting the transatlantic relationship back on track .
following his meeting with schröder , powell told reporters that the governments of the united states and germany had put their serious disagreements behind them and were ready to " move on . " meeting u.s. commander 's former villa in a subtle reminder of the importance germany placed on its relationship with america , fischer scheduled his afternoon meeting with powell at the former home of the commander of u.s. forces in berlin following world war ii .
though their bosses have talked only once in the past year , powell said he and fischer keep in regular contact . " joschka and i can always speak our hearts and minds to one another , " said powell , who thanked fischer for past speeches on the importance of the german-american relationship . " the weather is a symbol of how good our ties are , " said fischer , pointing to the sunny skies above during an otherwise cloudy day in berlin .
" they are not simple … but -lsb- germany -rsb- is shaped by its deep relationship to america . " no discussion of nato in iraq the two did not discuss a possible role for nato troops in postwar iraq .
though several european countries have pledged troops to maintain security in iraq , u.s. officials are reported to be looking for something more long-term . german soldiers have made up a large portion of the nato troops currently policing the balkans . but german politicians are reported to be wary of committing soldiers to maintaining stability in iraq , a war which the government opposed . " we focused on the security council decision , " said fischer .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2003 powell to germany : " we will stand together " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder on their way to the press conference friday colin powell and chancellor gerhard schröder held " deep " and " candid " talks that lasted a half-hour in berlin on friday morning .
the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .

the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .

the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .

germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .

the terrorist group could strike at any time in any place , including right here in germany . the editorial page of the hamburg-based financial times deutschland on friday considered the latest reminder from interior minister otto schily that germany remains under threat from al qaeda .
" schily was right to make the point , " the paper opined , " because despite the bloody attacks in bali and djerba , germans have become complacent .
the fanatic suicide attackers are too far away , sept .
11 , 2001 , was too long ago .
the truth is that no one here is safe from acts of terrorism .
leading al qaeda fighters lived in germany for years , and according to intelligence officials , some are still here . "
the government has a responsibility to keep the threat of terrorism in the public consciousness , the paper concluded .
meanwhile , the berliner kurier remained unconvinced by reassurances from security officials that there are no indications of a terrorist attack here in germany .
" there were n't any warnings for what happened in djerba or riyadh either , " the paper wrote , adding : " the sad truth is that it could happen anywhere .
al qaeda 's fighters are all over the world , prepared to kill .
there 's a very fine line between the necessary communication of important information , and panic-inducement .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2003 powell to germany : " we will stand together " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder on their way to the press conference friday colin powell and chancellor gerhard schröder held " deep " and " candid " talks that lasted a half-hour in berlin on friday morning .
the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .

the terrorist group could strike at any time in any place , including right here in germany . the editorial page of the hamburg-based financial times deutschland on friday considered the latest reminder from interior minister otto schily that germany remains under threat from al qaeda .
" schily was right to make the point , " the paper opined , " because despite the bloody attacks in bali and djerba , germans have become complacent .
the fanatic suicide attackers are too far away , sept .
11 , 2001 , was too long ago .
the truth is that no one here is safe from acts of terrorism .
leading al qaeda fighters lived in germany for years , and according to intelligence officials , some are still here . "
the government has a responsibility to keep the threat of terrorism in the public consciousness , the paper concluded .
meanwhile , the berliner kurier remained unconvinced by reassurances from security officials that there are no indications of a terrorist attack here in germany .
" there were n't any warnings for what happened in djerba or riyadh either , " the paper wrote , adding : " the sad truth is that it could happen anywhere .
al qaeda 's fighters are all over the world , prepared to kill .
there 's a very fine line between the necessary communication of important information , and panic-inducement .
but pretending there 's no danger does n't help anyone , " warned the paper .
berlin 's die welt commented on the release of six german tourists who were kidnapped in algeria .
" together with 11 hostages from other european countries , their frightening drama came to an end .
but there is no cause for joy yet , " the paper wrote , " because the fate of the 15 other hostages , including 10 germans , is still unclear .
no one should say that it 's the tourists ' fault anymore , that they are victims of their own thirst for adventure , " the paper noted .
" if it 's truly the case that terrorists are responsible for the kidnappings , then this is no protest against excessive tourism , it 's another attack in the crazy war against the west . "
but the stuttgarter zeitung offered an altogether different take : the kidnapped holiday makers in the sahara had to learn from bitter experience that the safe , idyllic desert getaway they bought was an illusion .
" when it comes to modern adventure travel , terror , war and crisis have become inescapable travel companions .
and since that 's not about to change , germans are not just world champions in adventure travel , they 're also masters in the art of suppressing the dangers such travel involves .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2003 powell to germany : " we will stand together " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder on their way to the press conference friday colin powell and chancellor gerhard schröder held " deep " and " candid " talks that lasted a half-hour in berlin on friday morning .
the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .
" we had a basic disagreement , " powell told german television channel zdf friday morning , adding that the two countries needed to " move on . "
" one way to get started is to begin cooperation on such issues as the u.n. resolution , " powell said .
security in afghanistan discussed following discussions the two had on germany 's presence as part of the international security assistance force in kabul , schröder told reporters that the government would review whether the force should be expanded beyond afghanistan 's capital . the country remains dangerously unstable more than a year after u.s. forces removed the taliban from power . germany currently has 2,500 soldiers stationed in kabul .
berlin will be on the highest possible security alert during the duration of powell 's visit , which will end early friday evening .
more than 1,000 additional police officers have been called for duty on friday and police snipers have been posted around powell 's high-security hotel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's visit to berlin 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the two said they put the differences between their two countries behind them . after a meeting that lasted just half an hour , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters that they have put the differences between their two nations behind them and that they would work together to lift the united nations sanctions against iraq .
standing before podiums and in front of u.s. , german and european union flags , powell and schröder said they had a " candid and direct " discussion with one another .
" there have been differences in the past , but we will stand together , " said powell , who is wrapping up a tour of the middle east , russia and europe with the stop in berlin .
as expected by many analysts , powell and schröder drew on the positives in the german-u.s. relationship .
the secretary of state praised the work of german troops in afghanistan and their leadership role in the balkans .
germany to help lift sanctions schröder , who enjoyed his first official meeting in berlin with a high-ranking member of the bush administration in almost a year , said germany was willing to help the u.s. lift the u.n. sanctions on iraq .
but what remains unclear is what germany 's position will be on the u.s.-british-spanish resolution currently being considered by the security council . a new copy of the resolution , as reported thursday , calls for a important role for a u.n. coordinator in iraq , but leaves descriptions of that appointee 's duties vague .
the us and great britain would still retain a large amount of input vis-a-vis the handling and spending of iraq 's oil wealth .
the resolution , on which the u.s. is pushing to get a vote next week , has been met with criticism in france and russia .
germany , which formed an anti-war alliance with the two countries in the security council in the diplomatic negotiations that preceded the invasion of iraq , has been relatively quiet on the issue .
powell said before the talks that if germany votes in favor of the new u.s. resolution , it could be a " possible start " to normalization of tense relations between the two countries , strained since schröder 's government came out strongly against a military invasion of iraq during fall elections .
" we had a basic disagreement , " powell told german television channel zdf friday morning , adding that the two countries needed to " move on . "
" one way to get started is to begin cooperation on such issues as the u.n. resolution , " powell said .
security in afghanistan discussed following discussions the two had on germany 's presence as part of the international security assistance force in kabul , schröder told reporters that the government would review whether the force should be expanded beyond afghanistan 's capital . the country remains dangerously unstable more than a year after u.s. forces removed the taliban from power . germany currently has 2,500 soldiers stationed in kabul .
berlin will be on the highest possible security alert during the duration of powell 's visit , which will end early friday evening .
more than 1,000 additional police officers have been called for duty on friday and police snipers have been posted around powell 's high-security hotel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's visit to berlin 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

by james arnold bbc news online business reporter in paris 10,100 tonnes of pulling power there may be a certain froideur in franco-american relations right now , but it 's hard to detect on the champ de mars .
queuing excitedly in the shadow of the eiffel tower , a gaggle of elderly american tourists express nothing but warm feelings for their french hosts .
" whatever mr bush says , we love france and love the french , " gushes jean bazarian from st louis .
" vive la france ! "
nor is mrs bazarian alone : according to the french tourist authorities , there is still no sign that americans are starting to visit france any less frequently , or to splash their dollars about any less extravagantly .
making paris pay which will be music to the ears of jacques marvillet .
eiffel tower facts and figures built 1889 for universal exposition 324 metres high weighs 10,100 tonnes ; paint alone weighs 60 tonnes employs more than 400 staff 204,381,152 visitors between 1889 and 2002 tower 's lifts travel 103,000 kilometres every year sells tickets weighing 2 tonnes each year mr marvillet is the man charged with wringing every last euro cent out of the eiffel tower , the city 's most popular and best-known paying attraction .
his company , the societe nouvelle d 'exploitation de la tour eiffel -lrb- snte -rrb- has presided over a huge increase in turnover at the tower since it was incorporated at the beginning of the 1980s .
americans account for 11 % of visitors to the tower , equivalent to britons in importance , and behind only the french themselves .
but while mr marvillet may be happy at holding on to his american clientele , he is now casting around for ways to start snte 's revenues growing again .
ups and downs over the past couple of years , snte has paused for breath after a blistering two decades .
there 's a long , long way to fall in 1981 , snte - a semi-public beast whose main shareholder is the paris city government - launched an expensive scheme to overhaul the tower .
" it had been neglected for many years , " says mr marvillet .
" and we discovered that , for structural reasons , we urgently needed to make the whole tower lighter by 1,000 tonnes . "
over the next three years , the firm stripped away the tower 's excess metal - equivalent to about 10 % of its weight - and bent its warped frame back into shape .
it installed bigger , faster lifts , and created three pavilions to house gift shops , a restaurant , a cinema and a post office .
growing pains together with a more commercially minded marketing campaign , the refurbishment helped to more than double visitor numbers - from 3 million in 1979 to 6.2 million last year .
in 1999 , the tower played host to its 200 millionth customer .
but since then , visitor numbers have bobbed about the six-million mark , and revenues , although inching up slightly in recent years , have yet to break much beyond 50m euros -lrb- £ 36m ; $ 57m -rrb- .
the tower , it seems , may have reached the limit of its capacity ; its super-fast lifts can not get any faster , and regulations and natural prudence prevent mr marvillet packing in more than 30,000 people on any one day .
adding glamour mr marvillet insists there is a little slack capacity , at least outside the crucial spring and summer months .
since the tower 's operating costs are fixed , he says , any increase in visitor numbers produces a far greater proportional increase in profits .
but bringing more people to the tower is always going to be tricky , as long as mr marvillet 's marketing is at the mercy of those marketing paris and france as a whole .
can paris get the most out of its premium brand ?
" almost everyone who comes to paris comes to the eiffel tower , but no-one comes to paris just because of the eiffel tower , " says mr marvillet .
money is being poured into making the tower more glamorous : after an outcry when millennium-year lighting was taken down in 2001 , the company spent 5m euros on a new 20,000-bulb display in late april .
and licensing the eiffel tower name looks like a potential goldmine : the firm earned just over 1m euros from copyright fees last year , even as every souvenir vendor in paris and beyond is cashing in on the tower 's unmistakable image .
going underground but the real profits are always going to be in squeezing more money out of each visitor the tower attracts already .
to that end , mr marvillet is planning snte 's biggest project since the early 1980s - an underground visitors ' centre , using the vast 16,000-square-metre space between the tower 's four feet .
at present , visitors are divided between the two or three of the foot entrances that are open at any one time .
but the new centre will shepherd them through one efficient - and , for snte , more lucrative - facility , combining ticket office , museum , shops and cafe .
competition time there is one snag , however .
at the end of 2005 , snte 's 25-year contract to run the tower finally comes to an end .
mr marvillet says he intends to tender for a renewal , but the uncertainty makes it tricky to plan ahead .
" it 's not possible to invest when we are so near the end of our contract , " he says .
" we hope it 's going to be renewed , but nothing is certain . "
competition : that 's one american import mr marvillet could do without .

eiffel tower facts and figures built 1889 for universal exposition 324 metres high weighs 10,100 tonnes ; paint alone weighs 60 tonnes employs more than 400 staff 204,381,152 visitors between 1889 and 2002 tower 's lifts travel 103,000 kilometres every year sells tickets weighing 2 tonnes each year mr marvillet is the man charged with wringing every last euro cent out of the eiffel tower , the city 's most popular and best-known paying attraction .
his company , the societe nouvelle d 'exploitation de la tour eiffel -lrb- snte -rrb- has presided over a huge increase in turnover at the tower since it was incorporated at the beginning of the 1980s .
americans account for 11 % of visitors to the tower , equivalent to britons in importance , and behind only the french themselves .
but while mr marvillet may be happy at holding on to his american clientele , he is now casting around for ways to start snte 's revenues growing again .
ups and downs over the past couple of years , snte has paused for breath after a blistering two decades .
there 's a long , long way to fall in 1981 , snte - a semi-public beast whose main shareholder is the paris city government - launched an expensive scheme to overhaul the tower .
" it had been neglected for many years , " says mr marvillet .
" and we discovered that , for structural reasons , we urgently needed to make the whole tower lighter by 1,000 tonnes . "
over the next three years , the firm stripped away the tower 's excess metal - equivalent to about 10 % of its weight - and bent its warped frame back into shape .
it installed bigger , faster lifts , and created three pavilions to house gift shops , a restaurant , a cinema and a post office .
growing pains together with a more commercially minded marketing campaign , the refurbishment helped to more than double visitor numbers - from 3 million in 1979 to 6.2 million last year .
in 1999 , the tower played host to its 200 millionth customer .
but since then , visitor numbers have bobbed about the six-million mark , and revenues , although inching up slightly in recent years , have yet to break much beyond 50m euros -lrb- £ 36m ; $ 57m -rrb- .
the tower , it seems , may have reached the limit of its capacity ; its super-fast lifts can not get any faster , and regulations and natural prudence prevent mr marvillet packing in more than 30,000 people on any one day .
adding glamour mr marvillet insists there is a little slack capacity , at least outside the crucial spring and summer months .
since the tower 's operating costs are fixed , he says , any increase in visitor numbers produces a far greater proportional increase in profits .
but bringing more people to the tower is always going to be tricky , as long as mr marvillet 's marketing is at the mercy of those marketing paris and france as a whole .
can paris get the most out of its premium brand ?
" almost everyone who comes to paris comes to the eiffel tower , but no-one comes to paris just because of the eiffel tower , " says mr marvillet .
money is being poured into making the tower more glamorous : after an outcry when millennium-year lighting was taken down in 2001 , the company spent 5m euros on a new 20,000-bulb display in late april .
and licensing the eiffel tower name looks like a potential goldmine : the firm earned just over 1m euros from copyright fees last year , even as every souvenir vendor in paris and beyond is cashing in on the tower 's unmistakable image .
going underground but the real profits are always going to be in squeezing more money out of each visitor the tower attracts already .
to that end , mr marvillet is planning snte 's biggest project since the early 1980s - an underground visitors ' centre , using the vast 16,000-square-metre space between the tower 's four feet .
at present , visitors are divided between the two or three of the foot entrances that are open at any one time .
but the new centre will shepherd them through one efficient - and , for snte , more lucrative - facility , combining ticket office , museum , shops and cafe .
competition time there is one snag , however .
at the end of 2005 , snte 's 25-year contract to run the tower finally comes to an end .
mr marvillet says he intends to tender for a renewal , but the uncertainty makes it tricky to plan ahead .
" it 's not possible to invest when we are so near the end of our contract , " he says .
" we hope it 's going to be renewed , but nothing is certain . "
competition : that 's one american import mr marvillet could do without .

exports fall gdp showed zero growth in the three month period to march after four straight quarters of solid , but slowing , rises .
exports , which account for 11 % of japan 's gdp , took the biggest hit , largely due to poor car exports to the us .

" exports will likely fall further , pressured by a decline to asia due to sars , " said soichi okuda , senior economist at aozora bank .

the boundary commission will have to address the dwindling population of belfast in its first review in eight years .
back in 1995 , the commission decided to increase the number of westminster seats from 17 to 18 .
however , the number of voters in all four constituencies in the city is well below average .
the latest electoral register reveals that the four belfast constituencies have since suffered a drop in voters , with south belfast suffering the most - it is now 17 % below the average electorate .
the commission has a number of options , including extending the boundaries of all four seats , or turning the four constituencies into three .
there are other problems too .
north antrim is more than 15 % above average .
the commission is expected to take its time before reaching any conclusions .
it could be late this year - or early next - before the provisional recommendations are published .
there will then be a period of public consultation and it is likely to be 2005 before the final decision is taken .
