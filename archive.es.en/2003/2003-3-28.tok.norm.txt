european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said . " a question of honor and reason " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leszek miller poland 's lower chamber of parliament approved the deployment on wednesday with a large majority of 328 to 71 with 38 abstentions .
before the vote prime minister miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliamentarians that participation in the " coalition of the willing , " as the united states has dubbed the group of states that supports its actions in iraq , is " justified by the -lsb- necessity for -rsb- solidarity with allies . "
it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .
instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .
the experiences of world war ii compounded the fears .
and after 1945 a pacifistic movement did n't emerge here , because people still believed that the threat from the west was real . " the fact that there is no tradition of pacifism in poland means that " fear of the war does not translate into actions , " borodzej says . the government 's decision to support the united states is neither challenged by the large oppositional parties nor by the population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2003 debate rages on german role in post-war iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of destruction - a mangled passenger bus lies 20 miles south of the iraqi capital baghdad .
a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .

at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .
those who say no to war , he said , " should be in the position to contribute something on their own .

european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .

20 , 2002 before the oil spill from the ' prestige ' oil tanker contaminates all the waters on the galician coast .
last november , the prestige , carrying 77,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil , caused a massive oil slick , when it broke in half in bad weather and released tons of black sludge which washed ashore onto the beaches of galicia and caused a major environmental catastrophe .
ban not watertight this time round , the eu is taking no chances .
however the guidelines , which are likely to come into force in july will also exempt certain vessels from the ban .
ministers agreed for instance to exempt smaller single hull vessels , those up to 5,000 metric tons , which are vital for supplying small islands with fuel for power stations .
these will be banned only from 2008 .
some single hull vessels recognized as safer by the imo , because they have segregated ballast tanks , will be allowed in the eu until 2010 .
the new eu guidelines will also carry details such as what is meant by " heavy fuel " and " heavy crude " oils , which will be banned form single hull vessels , as they present a greater risk of oil slicks when holed than more modern double-hull ships .
the state secretary in the german transport ministry , wolf nagel , described the eu decision as a " breakthrough for more safety on the seas . "
he said germany , with its natural coastline , had an interest in making deep sea navigation more secure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.03.2003 european companies fear they 'll be left out in post-war iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuilding war-torn iraq is likely to be a huge - and lucrative - task .
european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .
those who say no to war , he said , " should be in the position to contribute something on their own .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said . " a question of honor and reason " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leszek miller poland 's lower chamber of parliament approved the deployment on wednesday with a large majority of 328 to 71 with 38 abstentions .
before the vote prime minister miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliamentarians that participation in the " coalition of the willing , " as the united states has dubbed the group of states that supports its actions in iraq , is " justified by the -lsb- necessity for -rsb- solidarity with allies . "
it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .
instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .
the experiences of world war ii compounded the fears .
and after 1945 a pacifistic movement did n't emerge here , because people still believed that the threat from the west was real . " the fact that there is no tradition of pacifism in poland means that " fear of the war does not translate into actions , " borodzej says . the government 's decision to support the united states is neither challenged by the large oppositional parties nor by the population .
the u.s. is considered the most important guarantor of safety for poland .
but critics fear that poland could have endangered its future position in the european union by going against france and germany . poland is due to join the european union in january 2004 . bernd musch-borowska send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.03.2003 european companies fear they 'll be left out in post-war iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuilding war-torn iraq is likely to be a huge - and lucrative - task .
european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said . " a question of honor and reason " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leszek miller poland 's lower chamber of parliament approved the deployment on wednesday with a large majority of 328 to 71 with 38 abstentions .
before the vote prime minister miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliamentarians that participation in the " coalition of the willing , " as the united states has dubbed the group of states that supports its actions in iraq , is " justified by the -lsb- necessity for -rsb- solidarity with allies . "
it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .
instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .
the experiences of world war ii compounded the fears .
and after 1945 a pacifistic movement did n't emerge here , because people still believed that the threat from the west was real . " the fact that there is no tradition of pacifism in poland means that " fear of the war does not translate into actions , " borodzej says . the government 's decision to support the united states is neither challenged by the large oppositional parties nor by the population .
the u.s. is considered the most important guarantor of safety for poland .
but critics fear that poland could have endangered its future position in the european union by going against france and germany . poland is due to join the european union in january 2004 . bernd musch-borowska send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.03.2003 eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ban hopes to prevent a repeat of the prestige disaster off the coast of spain last year .
european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .

20 , 2002 before the oil spill from the ' prestige ' oil tanker contaminates all the waters on the galician coast .
last november , the prestige , carrying 77,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil , caused a massive oil slick , when it broke in half in bad weather and released tons of black sludge which washed ashore onto the beaches of galicia and caused a major environmental catastrophe .
ban not watertight this time round , the eu is taking no chances .
however the guidelines , which are likely to come into force in july will also exempt certain vessels from the ban .
ministers agreed for instance to exempt smaller single hull vessels , those up to 5,000 metric tons , which are vital for supplying small islands with fuel for power stations .
these will be banned only from 2008 .
some single hull vessels recognized as safer by the imo , because they have segregated ballast tanks , will be allowed in the eu until 2010 .
the new eu guidelines will also carry details such as what is meant by " heavy fuel " and " heavy crude " oils , which will be banned form single hull vessels , as they present a greater risk of oil slicks when holed than more modern double-hull ships .
the state secretary in the german transport ministry , wolf nagel , described the eu decision as a " breakthrough for more safety on the seas . "
he said germany , with its natural coastline , had an interest in making deep sea navigation more secure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said . " a question of honor and reason " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leszek miller poland 's lower chamber of parliament approved the deployment on wednesday with a large majority of 328 to 71 with 38 abstentions .
before the vote prime minister miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliamentarians that participation in the " coalition of the willing , " as the united states has dubbed the group of states that supports its actions in iraq , is " justified by the -lsb- necessity for -rsb- solidarity with allies . "
it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .
instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .
the experiences of world war ii compounded the fears .
and after 1945 a pacifistic movement did n't emerge here , because people still believed that the threat from the west was real . " the fact that there is no tradition of pacifism in poland means that " fear of the war does not translate into actions , " borodzej says . the government 's decision to support the united states is neither challenged by the large oppositional parties nor by the population .
the u.s. is considered the most important guarantor of safety for poland .
but critics fear that poland could have endangered its future position in the european union by going against france and germany . poland is due to join the european union in january 2004 . bernd musch-borowska send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .

she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.03.2003 european companies fear they 'll be left out in post-war iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuilding war-torn iraq is likely to be a huge - and lucrative - task .
european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said . " a question of honor and reason " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leszek miller poland 's lower chamber of parliament approved the deployment on wednesday with a large majority of 328 to 71 with 38 abstentions .
before the vote prime minister miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliamentarians that participation in the " coalition of the willing , " as the united states has dubbed the group of states that supports its actions in iraq , is " justified by the -lsb- necessity for -rsb- solidarity with allies . "
it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .
instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .

the formerly communist eastern european countries took a huge risk by aligning with washington rather than paris and berlin in the war against iraq .
but some are finding the mid-atlantic to be a cold and lonely place . in his speech before united states troops at a florida military base on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush praised washington 's newest military allies , singling out four formerly communist future european union members that were actively involved in military operations in the persian gulf .
though those countries are making marginal contributions to the war effort in iraq , bush singled them out because they have provided washington with a stronger hand in its feud against paris and berlin over iraq .
the czech republic , poland , romania and slovakia have mainly sent small units of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons specialists .
and most of them are stationed in kuwait , relatively far away from the front .
bulgaria , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania and ukraine are also participating in what bush has dubbed the " coalition of the willing . "
a goodwill gesture from central europe what 's important to the americans and brits is the good will and symbolic value that central europe 's participation brings - regardless whether or not it plays any decisive role in the outcome of the war .
the fact that in most of these countries the majority of the population opposes the war against iraq has been virtually ignored .
even the pope , a highly respected authority throughout central europe , has sharply criticized the war .
still , the former eastern bloc countries are continuously campaigning to convince their people to support the war using myriad tactics that sometimes even include the employment of erroneous historical arguments .
a favorite seems to be that , had the u.s. , britain and central europe joined forces in the late 1930s to resist hitler , world war ii never would have taken place .
above all , they like to say , the united states brought down the communist regimes singlehandedly , which is why - even according to some former dissidents - central europe is obliged to help to free the iraqi people from a brutal dictator .
but those analogies do n't really ring true .
the united states did not triumph over the soviet union on the battlefield per se .
on the contrary , avoiding direct military conflicts of any kind was the basis of the former adversaries ' relations .
the soviet union was not brought to its knees until the arms race reached its peak , which contributed to its financial crumble .
the comparison between saddam hussein and hitler misses the mark , too .
the iraqi leader last expressed his expansionist tendencies more than a decade ago when he invaded kuwait .
since then , he has n't threatened or attacked any country .
diffuse gratitude ultimately , the main reason poland and the others support the u.s. in the war against iraq is a diffuse feeling of gratitude .
but the central european states are also motivated by a sense of unease with the paris-berlin peace axis that awakens fears of franco-german hegemony in europe .
however , central europe 's leaders have begun to realize that washington is a lot farther away than paris or berlin and that warsaw , prague and budapest think more like the latter two than the former .
that is probably part of the reason why the czech government recently announced that its position on iraq actually lay somewhere between europe and america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2003 opinion : eastern europe and the ' coalition of the willing ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe 's contribution to the war on iraq has been small but symbolic .
the formerly communist eastern european countries took a huge risk by aligning with washington rather than paris and berlin in the war against iraq .
but some are finding the mid-atlantic to be a cold and lonely place . in his speech before united states troops at a florida military base on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush praised washington 's newest military allies , singling out four formerly communist future european union members that were actively involved in military operations in the persian gulf .
though those countries are making marginal contributions to the war effort in iraq , bush singled them out because they have provided washington with a stronger hand in its feud against paris and berlin over iraq .
the czech republic , poland , romania and slovakia have mainly sent small units of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons specialists .
and most of them are stationed in kuwait , relatively far away from the front .
bulgaria , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania and ukraine are also participating in what bush has dubbed the " coalition of the willing . "
a goodwill gesture from central europe what 's important to the americans and brits is the good will and symbolic value that central europe 's participation brings - regardless whether or not it plays any decisive role in the outcome of the war .
the fact that in most of these countries the majority of the population opposes the war against iraq has been virtually ignored .
even the pope , a highly respected authority throughout central europe , has sharply criticized the war .
still , the former eastern bloc countries are continuously campaigning to convince their people to support the war using myriad tactics that sometimes even include the employment of erroneous historical arguments .
a favorite seems to be that , had the u.s. , britain and central europe joined forces in the late 1930s to resist hitler , world war ii never would have taken place .
above all , they like to say , the united states brought down the communist regimes singlehandedly , which is why - even according to some former dissidents - central europe is obliged to help to free the iraqi people from a brutal dictator .
but those analogies do n't really ring true .
the united states did not triumph over the soviet union on the battlefield per se .
on the contrary , avoiding direct military conflicts of any kind was the basis of the former adversaries ' relations .
the soviet union was not brought to its knees until the arms race reached its peak , which contributed to its financial crumble .
the comparison between saddam hussein and hitler misses the mark , too .
the iraqi leader last expressed his expansionist tendencies more than a decade ago when he invaded kuwait .
since then , he has n't threatened or attacked any country .
diffuse gratitude ultimately , the main reason poland and the others support the u.s. in the war against iraq is a diffuse feeling of gratitude .
but the central european states are also motivated by a sense of unease with the paris-berlin peace axis that awakens fears of franco-german hegemony in europe .
however , central europe 's leaders have begun to realize that washington is a lot farther away than paris or berlin and that warsaw , prague and budapest think more like the latter two than the former .
that is probably part of the reason why the czech government recently announced that its position on iraq actually lay somewhere between europe and america .
but it is n't likely to stay there because the mid-atlantic is too cold and wet and , above all , lonely .

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said . " a question of honor and reason " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leszek miller poland 's lower chamber of parliament approved the deployment on wednesday with a large majority of 328 to 71 with 38 abstentions .
before the vote prime minister miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliamentarians that participation in the " coalition of the willing , " as the united states has dubbed the group of states that supports its actions in iraq , is " justified by the -lsb- necessity for -rsb- solidarity with allies . "
it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .
instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .
the experiences of world war ii compounded the fears .
and after 1945 a pacifistic movement did n't emerge here , because people still believed that the threat from the west was real . " the fact that there is no tradition of pacifism in poland means that " fear of the war does not translate into actions , " borodzej says . the government 's decision to support the united states is neither challenged by the large oppositional parties nor by the population .
the u.s. is considered the most important guarantor of safety for poland .
but critics fear that poland could have endangered its future position in the european union by going against france and germany . poland is due to join the european union in january 2004 . bernd musch-borowska send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen collect cockles and clams in the estuary in noya , north west spain wednesday nov .
20 , 2002 before the oil spill from the ' prestige ' oil tanker contaminates all the waters on the galician coast .
last november , the prestige , carrying 77,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil , caused a massive oil slick , when it broke in half in bad weather and released tons of black sludge which washed ashore onto the beaches of galicia and caused a major environmental catastrophe .
ban not watertight this time round , the eu is taking no chances .
however the guidelines , which are likely to come into force in july will also exempt certain vessels from the ban .
ministers agreed for instance to exempt smaller single hull vessels , those up to 5,000 metric tons , which are vital for supplying small islands with fuel for power stations .
these will be banned only from 2008 .
some single hull vessels recognized as safer by the imo , because they have segregated ballast tanks , will be allowed in the eu until 2010 .
the new eu guidelines will also carry details such as what is meant by " heavy fuel " and " heavy crude " oils , which will be banned form single hull vessels , as they present a greater risk of oil slicks when holed than more modern double-hull ships .
the state secretary in the german transport ministry , wolf nagel , described the eu decision as a " breakthrough for more safety on the seas . "
he said germany , with its natural coastline , had an interest in making deep sea navigation more secure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .
those who say no to war , he said , " should be in the position to contribute something on their own .

economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .

about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .
those who say no to war , he said , " should be in the position to contribute something on their own .

european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen collect cockles and clams in the estuary in noya , north west spain wednesday nov .
20 , 2002 before the oil spill from the ' prestige ' oil tanker contaminates all the waters on the galician coast .
last november , the prestige , carrying 77,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil , caused a massive oil slick , when it broke in half in bad weather and released tons of black sludge which washed ashore onto the beaches of galicia and caused a major environmental catastrophe .
ban not watertight this time round , the eu is taking no chances .
however the guidelines , which are likely to come into force in july will also exempt certain vessels from the ban .
ministers agreed for instance to exempt smaller single hull vessels , those up to 5,000 metric tons , which are vital for supplying small islands with fuel for power stations .
these will be banned only from 2008 .
some single hull vessels recognized as safer by the imo , because they have segregated ballast tanks , will be allowed in the eu until 2010 .
the new eu guidelines will also carry details such as what is meant by " heavy fuel " and " heavy crude " oils , which will be banned form single hull vessels , as they present a greater risk of oil slicks when holed than more modern double-hull ships .
the state secretary in the german transport ministry , wolf nagel , described the eu decision as a " breakthrough for more safety on the seas . "
he said germany , with its natural coastline , had an interest in making deep sea navigation more secure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.03.2003 european companies fear they 'll be left out in post-war iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuilding war-torn iraq is likely to be a huge - and lucrative - task .
european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

on the contrary , avoiding direct military conflicts of any kind was the basis of the former adversaries ' relations .
the soviet union was not brought to its knees until the arms race reached its peak , which contributed to its financial crumble .
the comparison between saddam hussein and hitler misses the mark , too .
the iraqi leader last expressed his expansionist tendencies more than a decade ago when he invaded kuwait .
since then , he has n't threatened or attacked any country .
diffuse gratitude ultimately , the main reason poland and the others support the u.s. in the war against iraq is a diffuse feeling of gratitude .
but the central european states are also motivated by a sense of unease with the paris-berlin peace axis that awakens fears of franco-german hegemony in europe .
however , central europe 's leaders have begun to realize that washington is a lot farther away than paris or berlin and that warsaw , prague and budapest think more like the latter two than the former .
that is probably part of the reason why the czech government recently announced that its position on iraq actually lay somewhere between europe and america .
but it is n't likely to stay there because the mid-atlantic is too cold and wet and , above all , lonely .

european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .

it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .

if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .

the formerly communist eastern european countries took a huge risk by aligning with washington rather than paris and berlin in the war against iraq .
but some are finding the mid-atlantic to be a cold and lonely place . in his speech before united states troops at a florida military base on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush praised washington 's newest military allies , singling out four formerly communist future european union members that were actively involved in military operations in the persian gulf .
though those countries are making marginal contributions to the war effort in iraq , bush singled them out because they have provided washington with a stronger hand in its feud against paris and berlin over iraq .
the czech republic , poland , romania and slovakia have mainly sent small units of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons specialists .
and most of them are stationed in kuwait , relatively far away from the front .
bulgaria , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania and ukraine are also participating in what bush has dubbed the " coalition of the willing . "
a goodwill gesture from central europe what 's important to the americans and brits is the good will and symbolic value that central europe 's participation brings - regardless whether or not it plays any decisive role in the outcome of the war .
the fact that in most of these countries the majority of the population opposes the war against iraq has been virtually ignored .
even the pope , a highly respected authority throughout central europe , has sharply criticized the war .
still , the former eastern bloc countries are continuously campaigning to convince their people to support the war using myriad tactics that sometimes even include the employment of erroneous historical arguments .
a favorite seems to be that , had the u.s. , britain and central europe joined forces in the late 1930s to resist hitler , world war ii never would have taken place .
above all , they like to say , the united states brought down the communist regimes singlehandedly , which is why - even according to some former dissidents - central europe is obliged to help to free the iraqi people from a brutal dictator .
but those analogies do n't really ring true .
the united states did not triumph over the soviet union on the battlefield per se .
on the contrary , avoiding direct military conflicts of any kind was the basis of the former adversaries ' relations .
the soviet union was not brought to its knees until the arms race reached its peak , which contributed to its financial crumble .
the comparison between saddam hussein and hitler misses the mark , too .
the iraqi leader last expressed his expansionist tendencies more than a decade ago when he invaded kuwait .
since then , he has n't threatened or attacked any country .
diffuse gratitude ultimately , the main reason poland and the others support the u.s. in the war against iraq is a diffuse feeling of gratitude .
but the central european states are also motivated by a sense of unease with the paris-berlin peace axis that awakens fears of franco-german hegemony in europe .
however , central europe 's leaders have begun to realize that washington is a lot farther away than paris or berlin and that warsaw , prague and budapest think more like the latter two than the former .
that is probably part of the reason why the czech government recently announced that its position on iraq actually lay somewhere between europe and america .
but it is n't likely to stay there because the mid-atlantic is too cold and wet and , above all , lonely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.03.2003 eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu ban hopes to prevent a repeat of the prestige disaster off the coast of spain last year .
european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .

20 , 2002 before the oil spill from the ' prestige ' oil tanker contaminates all the waters on the galician coast .
last november , the prestige , carrying 77,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil , caused a massive oil slick , when it broke in half in bad weather and released tons of black sludge which washed ashore onto the beaches of galicia and caused a major environmental catastrophe .
ban not watertight this time round , the eu is taking no chances .
however the guidelines , which are likely to come into force in july will also exempt certain vessels from the ban .
ministers agreed for instance to exempt smaller single hull vessels , those up to 5,000 metric tons , which are vital for supplying small islands with fuel for power stations .
these will be banned only from 2008 .
some single hull vessels recognized as safer by the imo , because they have segregated ballast tanks , will be allowed in the eu until 2010 .
the new eu guidelines will also carry details such as what is meant by " heavy fuel " and " heavy crude " oils , which will be banned form single hull vessels , as they present a greater risk of oil slicks when holed than more modern double-hull ships .
the state secretary in the german transport ministry , wolf nagel , described the eu decision as a " breakthrough for more safety on the seas . "
he said germany , with its natural coastline , had an interest in making deep sea navigation more secure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .
those who say no to war , he said , " should be in the position to contribute something on their own .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

the formerly communist eastern european countries took a huge risk by aligning with washington rather than paris and berlin in the war against iraq .
but some are finding the mid-atlantic to be a cold and lonely place . in his speech before united states troops at a florida military base on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush praised washington 's newest military allies , singling out four formerly communist future european union members that were actively involved in military operations in the persian gulf .
though those countries are making marginal contributions to the war effort in iraq , bush singled them out because they have provided washington with a stronger hand in its feud against paris and berlin over iraq .
the czech republic , poland , romania and slovakia have mainly sent small units of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons specialists .
and most of them are stationed in kuwait , relatively far away from the front .
bulgaria , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania and ukraine are also participating in what bush has dubbed the " coalition of the willing . "
a goodwill gesture from central europe what 's important to the americans and brits is the good will and symbolic value that central europe 's participation brings - regardless whether or not it plays any decisive role in the outcome of the war .
the fact that in most of these countries the majority of the population opposes the war against iraq has been virtually ignored .
even the pope , a highly respected authority throughout central europe , has sharply criticized the war .
still , the former eastern bloc countries are continuously campaigning to convince their people to support the war using myriad tactics that sometimes even include the employment of erroneous historical arguments .
a favorite seems to be that , had the u.s. , britain and central europe joined forces in the late 1930s to resist hitler , world war ii never would have taken place .
above all , they like to say , the united states brought down the communist regimes singlehandedly , which is why - even according to some former dissidents - central europe is obliged to help to free the iraqi people from a brutal dictator .
but those analogies do n't really ring true .
the united states did not triumph over the soviet union on the battlefield per se .
on the contrary , avoiding direct military conflicts of any kind was the basis of the former adversaries ' relations .
the soviet union was not brought to its knees until the arms race reached its peak , which contributed to its financial crumble .
the comparison between saddam hussein and hitler misses the mark , too .
the iraqi leader last expressed his expansionist tendencies more than a decade ago when he invaded kuwait .
since then , he has n't threatened or attacked any country .
diffuse gratitude ultimately , the main reason poland and the others support the u.s. in the war against iraq is a diffuse feeling of gratitude .
but the central european states are also motivated by a sense of unease with the paris-berlin peace axis that awakens fears of franco-german hegemony in europe .
however , central europe 's leaders have begun to realize that washington is a lot farther away than paris or berlin and that warsaw , prague and budapest think more like the latter two than the former .
that is probably part of the reason why the czech government recently announced that its position on iraq actually lay somewhere between europe and america .
but it is n't likely to stay there because the mid-atlantic is too cold and wet and , above all , lonely .

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said .

it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .

if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .

instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .
the experiences of world war ii compounded the fears .
and after 1945 a pacifistic movement did n't emerge here , because people still believed that the threat from the west was real . " the fact that there is no tradition of pacifism in poland means that " fear of the war does not translate into actions , " borodzej says . the government 's decision to support the united states is neither challenged by the large oppositional parties nor by the population .
the u.s. is considered the most important guarantor of safety for poland .
but critics fear that poland could have endangered its future position in the european union by going against france and germany . poland is due to join the european union in january 2004 . bernd musch-borowska send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .

a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .
while chancellor schröder says berlin will provide prompt humanitarian aid , he 's evasive about financial and military commitments . as the u.s.-led conflict in iraq enters its seventh day , germany , with its reputation as a generous donor in times of need , has begun debating the painstaking process of reconstructing a shattered post-war iraq .
chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear on wednesday that berlin would do everything it could to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the suffering iraqi population .
" we want a discussion to be initiated in the u.n. security council as soon as possible , " he said in berlin .
" the resources that are needed for it -lrb- humanitarian help -rrb- are and will be made available , " he promised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a member of the royal marines 42 commando group , right , helps iraqi citizens of umm qsar .
schröder has already pledged € 50 million -lrb- $ 53.4 million -rrb- in immediate aid to ease the immense humanitarian crisis facing iraq .
there are also discussions within the german foreign ministry on how to raise the amount of funds earmarked for humanitarian aid to iraq .
the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is also reportedly deciding on whether to set aside a further € 10 million for emergency and refugee aid .
the u.n. world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- estimates that the biggest humanitarian operation in history will be needed in iraq to feed the population after the war .
a spokesperson of the wfp said on wednesday in rome that some 27 million people , the entire population of iraq , will be in need of basic foodstuff once the war is over .
" what we imagine is an enormous program , perhaps the biggest humanitarian operation in history , " he said .
the wfp estimates that the costs of the humanitarian operation could be as high as $ 1 billion .
government unclear about exact role but while most members of schröder ’ s governing coalition of social-democrats and greens agree that providing prompt humanitarian aid is a priority for germany , they are divided when it comes to the exact nature of germany ’ s role in the reconstruction of iraq .
amid calls from the conservative opposition that providing mere humanitarian aid on the part of germany is not enough , christine scheel of the green party who chairs the parliamentary finance committee , ruled out any german help in iraq like the one seen during the last gulf war in 1990-1991 .
back then germany , in a much healthier economic state , paid about € 8.3 billion to the u.s. , britain and france for mainly " classical military responsibilities " such as freeing kuwait from saddam hussein ’ s occupation .
" that will not be repeated , " scheel warned on wednesday .
another member of chancellor schröder ’ s cabinet , international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek zeul made it clear earlier this week that washington would have to bear the major brunt of the cost of the war in iraq .
" those who have destroyed , must bear the main cost of reconstruction , " she said bluntly .
schröder remains non-commital chancellor schröder has so far refused to be as unequivocal in his statements regarding the future of iraq and repeatedly put off committing himself to any kind of concrete responsibility in post-war iraq .
he said it was too early for such discussions at a time when hostilities were still going on .
when the war is over , the discussions should only take place under the auspices of the u.n. , schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder " i think , it makes no sense to discuss the question of finances .
i think , that one must and can use the existing resources of the country in the first place , " he said with regard to the oil reserves in iraq .
economic experts estimate that the costs of rebuilding iraq are likely to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars , way beyond u.s. calculations of some $ 75 billion .
reconstructing iraq could cost germany dearly but despite the chancellor ’ s refusal to be drawn into a discussion about the reconstruction of iraq , experts in germany are already warning that the direct and indirect costs of the war in iraq will put a massive strain on germany ’ s federal budget .
the head of the institute for european economy in bremen , rudolf hickel told news agency afp on wednesday that germany could end up shelling out € 20 to 30 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian work in iraq .
even the deputy head of the social democrat parliamentary group , gernot erler has said that german participation in reconstruction efforts for iraq could lead to further budgetary problems for germany at a time when the country is in dire financial straits .
erler said that that since no specific funds had been earmarked in the federal budget for a comprehensive german role in post-war iraq , germany ’ s participation could lead to new debts .
german economy and business leaders have shown mixed feelings about the chances for german firms to receive profitable contracts in the reconstruction of iraq .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- and the construction industry are optimistic that if the reconstruction of iraq takes place under the aegis of the international community , german companies could expect a fair share of the contracts .
" then our firms would stand a chance , " a spokesperson of the dihk told reuters .
he said that the german construction industry was interested in contracts in the gulf region and had worked there intensively in the 1970s- and 80s .
on the other hand the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- is skeptical of german firms gaining a foothold in iraq 's reconstruction , fearing that most of the contracts would be awarded to u.s. companies and agencies .
the reconstruction of iraq is already being planned by the american agency for international development , usaid , that has a budget of $ 600 million and in principle , the agency is meant to give all interested companies a fair chance when awarding contracts . will german soldiers be sent to post-war iraq ?
apart from the humanitarian and financial aspects of german help in post-war iraq , chancellor schröder has also remained vague on whether germany ’ s military will be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operations in iraq .
schröder avoided answering questions on whether german soldiers would be involved in any u.n. peacekeeping mission in post-conflict iraq .
at a press conference in berlin on wednesday , schröder said he considered it " wrong " to have such " theoretical " debates at such a time , but said that germany would fulfill its international obligations .
schröder also said stressed that defense minister , peter struck , had also ruled out the deployment of german soldiers as u.n. peacekeepers , thus quashing earlier speculation that the german government was planning to send in german u.n. peacekeepers to iraq and raise the budget of the german military for that purpose .
about 9,000 german soldiers are currently deployed on foreign soil .
at the same time , schröder , a staunch opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq , didn ’ t entirely rule out sending german soldiers to post-war iraq , saying he didn ’ t want to have a public debate on it before the war ended .
in a sign that the chancellor might actually be considering a bigger role for the german military in iraq , schröder told die zeit newspaper that the iraq crisis had shown that a stronger european defense policy was necessary .
those who say no to war , he said , " should be in the position to contribute something on their own .

poland has sent troops to the persian gulf to support the u.s. although its soldiers are fighting alongside the americans , the government says it 's not involved in war but just enforcing the u.n. embargo against iraq . photos of polish soldiers deployed in iraq cover the title pages of poland 's newspapers . " poland on the battlefield , our men pummel saddam hussein 's armed forces , " the polish tabloid super express writes beneath an image of grom members , the polish special force that reportedly overwhelmed iraqi militiamen in recent fighting .
around 60 servicemen from the polish army 's special unit are fighting side-by-side with u.s. marines in iraq , prime minister leszek miller says . " i can confirm that grom soldiers have already carried out several successful campaigns in southern iraq , in the coastal region of the persian gulf , without casualties on our side , " he said .
" these activities have been judged very professional and effective .
our soldiers are receiving very good grades . " poland earmarked up to 200 soldiers for the mission , including the elite grom unit , a special unit for fighting chemical weapons and the crew of the battleship xaver czernicki that provides logistical aid in support of the u.n. embargo against iraq in the persian gulf . from the very beginning , poland promised the united states political and military support for military strikes against iraq and proposed providing a contingent of 300 soldiers .
the u.s. then hand-picked the servicemen they wanted to use , a spokesman for the polish general staff , zdislaw gnatowski , said . " a question of honor and reason " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister leszek miller poland 's lower chamber of parliament approved the deployment on wednesday with a large majority of 328 to 71 with 38 abstentions .
before the vote prime minister miller -lrb- photo -rrb- told parliamentarians that participation in the " coalition of the willing , " as the united states has dubbed the group of states that supports its actions in iraq , is " justified by the -lsb- necessity for -rsb- solidarity with allies . "
it was a " question of honor and reason , " he told parliament . some opposition members believe though that partaking in an offensive war violates the polish constitution . but the government does n't view the deployment of polish soldiers as an issue of war .
instead , it says that the measures are meant to enforce the u.n. embargo . poland is dispatching its troops based on u.n. resolution 1441 , says piotr henryk winczorek , an expert on the polish constitution at warsaw university .
if , however , it is determined that the resolution is legally insufficient to warrant military action in iraq , polish participation may also be constitutionally dubious , says winczorek .
" if the international legal basis is not ultimately clarified , the situation will remain complicated .
if u.n. resolution 1441 is determined to be a sufficient reason , as the americans maintain , then there will be a sort of chain reaction .
first -lsb- comes -rsb- international law then polish law .
then the matter would be settled , " winczorek told dw-radio . " if , however , u.n. resolution 1441 is not sufficient - i would rather not talk about it or even think about it , " he said .
" it would have far-reaching consequences . " no protest culture every day a small group of demonstrators collects in front of the u.s. embassy in warsaw to protest against the war .
although surveys have shown that more than 75 percent of poles oppose the war , hardly more than 100 or 200 people come to the demonstrations .
there is no pronounced peace movement in poland , explains historian wlodzimierz borodzej from warsaw university . " there is no tradition of pacifism in poland .
in 1918 , when the republic was reconstituted , poles felt threatened by the majority of their neighbors , especially from germany and the soviet union .
the experiences of world war ii compounded the fears .
and after 1945 a pacifistic movement did n't emerge here , because people still believed that the threat from the west was real . " the fact that there is no tradition of pacifism in poland means that " fear of the war does not translate into actions , " borodzej says . the government 's decision to support the united states is neither challenged by the large oppositional parties nor by the population .
the u.s. is considered the most important guarantor of safety for poland .
but critics fear that poland could have endangered its future position in the european union by going against france and germany . poland is due to join the european union in january 2004 . bernd musch-borowska send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .
at the same time , the agency said that a " large enough number of u.s. applications " are already in place for the first eight projects .
the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

the administrator of the u.s. agency for international reconstruction , andrew natsios , said on wednesday that post-war reconstruction contracts for iraq totaling $ 1.9 billion would go to american firms by law , but half of the rebuilding work will be open to subcontractors .
even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .

european firms hoping to get a slice of the massive reconstruction in post-war iraq fear they may be left out in the cold by a u.s.-led initiative .
the first two contracts have already been awarded to american firms . as the u.s.-led war against iraq enters its second week and air strikes continue to bomb baghdad ’ s buildings , there ’ s little doubt that the reconstruction of a shattered post-war iraq will turn out to be a massive operation .
companies around the world have already begun eyeing the prospects of lucrative contracts for rebuilding iraq ’ s roads , schools , ports , bridges and other damaged infrastructure .
in europe , in particular , british , french and german engineering and construction companies are hoping to grab plum contracts to rebuild iraq owing to their technological expertise .
but whether that will materialize depends on the united states agency for international development , usaid , which is in charge of overseeing and awarding contracts for the first phase of postwar reconstruction .
iraq 's reconstruction a touchy topic for the u.s. signs aren ’ t encouraging so far .
usaid has invited tenders for eight large contracts , and already awarded two to u.s. firms .
the first winners in the massive money grab include the u.s. logistics group international resources group -lrb- irs -rrb- and the stevedoring services of america -lrb- ssa -rrb- .
they have been given a total of $ 11.9 million .
the irs is expected to provide logistics for $ 7.1 million while the ssa has been given a $ 4.8 million contract to repair and manage the severely damaged but strategically important port of umm qasr in southern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a oil well burns in southern iraq the wall street journal reported that bidding solicitations also went out to parsons corp. , louis berger group , inc. and engineering and construction firm kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- , a subsidiary of halliburton , which was once headed by u.s. vice president dick cheney .
kbr is reported to have received the first contract to extinguish burning oilfields in iraq and carry out the first repair work in the oil industry .
the reconstruction of iraq is a controversial topic in the u.s. , with the u.s. government being repeatedly accused of only being interested in controlling iraq ’ s enormous oil fields .
the bush administration has vehemently rejected the accusations , with several officials assuring from time to time that the oil wealth belongs to the iraqis and should be used to benefit them .
but there remains little doubt that once u.s. forces succeed in ousting saddam hussein , it will be the americans who will initially be in control of iraqi oilfields .
indeed , the u.s. is planning to finance the reconstruction of iraq through the sale of oil .
u.s. eager to emphasize fair play usaid , which is reported to have a budget of $ 900 million for rebuilding contracts in iraq ranging from street construction to providing medical supplies , has insisted that it does not give preferential treatment to american firms when it comes to handing out contracts .
" non-american firms are not excluded , " usaid said in a press release .

even the u.s. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , alan larson , on a trip to europe this week , was eager to play down suspicions that european companies were being sidelined in the u.s. procurement process .
" i am surprised there should be any concern over contracts , " larson told journalists in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wrecked car is seen on a busy baghdad street after iraqi official said two cruise missiles hit a residential area , killing 14 people the motivation behind contract awards was to restore disrupted electricity supplies , open up ports and ensure that water was safe to drink as quickly as possible , he said .
" it ’ s the responsible thing to do , " he said .
" these contracts are about how we help the iraqi people effectively . "
british firms sure of getting some work but despite american assurances that bidding for reconstruction contracts will be fair and open to all , several european companies are worried that they will be cut out of the first phase of contracts for postwar reconstruction .
one prominent exception is britain .
officials on both sides of the atlantic acknowledge that british companies will be first in line after the u.s. for subcontracting work given the country ’ s special status as washington 's staunchest ally in the war against iraq .
" we have had extensive discussions -lrb- with british companies -rrb- and there is no doubt that some of the american funds will go to british subcontractors , " natsios said .
british trade minister patricia hewitt , too , appeared confident british firms would be considered as contenders .
" british companies have strong trade ties with the u.s. and they have much expertise to offer .
that ’ s why i believe that many of our companies will be participating , " she told dw-radio this week .
britain ’ s crown agents , a procurement agency with worldwide operations , is already working on purchasing activities in the gulf region for usaid ’ s iraqi initiatives as a subcontractor .
other british companies tipped to be involved in the bidding process include the construction and engineering firms balfour beatty , carillion and amec .
european companies fear remaining empty-handed but while british companies can rely on their solid ties with the u.s. to expect future work in the gulf region , many european firms will have a tougher time trying to get a foot in the door , given the souring of transatlantic relations over the iraq crisis .
" i am quite sure that the americans will try hard to reserve this kind of business for themselves , " rudolf rupprecht , chief executive of german truck-maker and industrial group man , told reuters .
" the rebuilding situation will depend on the development in the relationship between the united states and europe , " he said .
german firms fret several european countries , in particular war opponents france and germany , are now calling for a total overhaul of the rebuilding efforts and for the united nations to play the key role rather than the u.s. the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , michael rogowski is also pushing for the u.n. to play a central part in iraq ’ s reconstruction .
he hopes that the reconstruction , much like in afghanistan , will be decided upon within the framework of an international donor conference .
" and then germany will and must participate , " he told reuters .
rogowski added that many german firms fear not getting any contract work at all in iraq .
hannes hesse , managing director of the frankfurt-based vdma machinery and plant builders ’ association told the financial times , " it is obvious that the initial contracts will go to u.s. and , possibly , british companies .
the political climate between the u.s. and germany is not good , and this makes a difference for our companies . "
hesse also said that germany could contribute to iraq ’ s reconstruction because many of iraq ’ s oil exploration plants and other installations were originally built by german companies in the period before the first gulf war .
france anxious about special ties with iraq france , too , is urging the un to get involved in the rebuilding of iraq .
" the un must be at the heart of the reconstruction and administration of iraq , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in london on thursday .
french firms like renault , peugeot , saint-goban and totalfinaelf are worried that president jacques chirac ’ s strong stance against the war , which has angered both washington and london , may result in their total exclusion from the rebuilding process .
to counter that possibility , the french finance ministry and the employers ’ association medef have commissioned a 10-member working group to examine " how french firms can come back to baghdad . "
paris and baghdad have maintained a close partnership for decades .

european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year . four months after the oil tanker prestige broke apart off the spanish coast causing one of the worst oil slicks in history , the eu is determined to prevent a repeat of the disaster .
on thursday , eu transport ministers approved a law , which once confirmed by the european parliament , will immediately ban most single hull ships older than 23 years of age carrying highly polluting forms of oil from calling at eu ports .
the single-hulled prestige was 26 years old . " spectacular step ahead " eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio described the move as a " spectacular step ahead . "
she added that the eu would push for the ban to be adopted globally by the international maritime organization -lrb- imo -rrb- by the end of the year .
the commissioner said that although the ban only barred ships from docking at eu ports , the effect would be to exclude them from eu waters , as most vessels travelling the eu coast need to call in for refueling .
" this means they won ’ t be able to sail along our coasts , as is already the case in north america , " she told a news briefing .
she added that she was negotiating with russian and north african states to back the global-level ban .
so far , spain , portugal and france have adopted a policy of banning ships they deem pose an environmental risk 200 miles from their coasts .
this is however not part of official eu policy .
erika and prestige disasters prompt eu into action the eu ban is a result of two recent disastrous accidents involving rusting single hull tankers .
in december 1997 , the tanker erika sank off the brittany coast , spilling its toxic cargo and devastating wildlife and tourism .
at the time the eu decided to ban single hull tankers altogether , but then buckled under heavy international pressure , and put off implementing the ban till 2015 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen collect cockles and clams in the estuary in noya , north west spain wednesday nov .
20 , 2002 before the oil spill from the ' prestige ' oil tanker contaminates all the waters on the galician coast .
last november , the prestige , carrying 77,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil , caused a massive oil slick , when it broke in half in bad weather and released tons of black sludge which washed ashore onto the beaches of galicia and caused a major environmental catastrophe .
ban not watertight this time round , the eu is taking no chances .
however the guidelines , which are likely to come into force in july will also exempt certain vessels from the ban .
ministers agreed for instance to exempt smaller single hull vessels , those up to 5,000 metric tons , which are vital for supplying small islands with fuel for power stations .
these will be banned only from 2008 .
some single hull vessels recognized as safer by the imo , because they have segregated ballast tanks , will be allowed in the eu until 2010 .
the new eu guidelines will also carry details such as what is meant by " heavy fuel " and " heavy crude " oils , which will be banned form single hull vessels , as they present a greater risk of oil slicks when holed than more modern double-hull ships .
the state secretary in the german transport ministry , wolf nagel , described the eu decision as a " breakthrough for more safety on the seas . "
he said germany , with its natural coastline , had an interest in making deep sea navigation more secure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the move was agreed between management at the renewable energy visitor centre and major creditors .
the £ 5.5m gaia energy centre , at delabole , was opened in august 2001 .
but only 52,000 people , half the number of visitors hoped for , have visited the attraction so far .
an underlying problem is that it did not get all the grant funding that it had expected when it opened , so management have had to borrow far more than they had planned .
' vicious circle ' it now needs to ensure it is on a proper legal and financial footing , and that means going into administration while its problems are addressed .
the centre 's receiver , andy beckingham , said he hoped to find a new owner so gaia can continue trading .
he said : " it 's been a bit of a vicious circle .
if there are n't enough visitors generating income then the facility can not invest in its exhibitions , which in turn leads to a further downturn in visitors .
" in recent weeks a very exciting business plan has been prepared , and i am very much hoping that plan can be implemented so people can enjoy the gaia experience . "
the centre , which is built next to the uk 's first commercial wind farm , features an exhibition on environmental issues and renewable energy .
it was set up with help and money from the european union and the south west regional development agency , and is run by a charitable trust .

with around 100 rodong-1 missiles reportedly deployed in north korea , capable of striking anywhere in japan , and tensions on the korean peninsula rising by the day , tokyo has good reason to want to further its knowledge of the north 's behaviour .
the first two satellites - one optical , and one radar - were launched aboard an h-2a rocket at japan 's space centre on southern tanegashima island .
if all goes to plan , two more launches are expected before march 2004 .
all four satellites will cost a total of about 250 billion yen -lrb- $ 2.05bn -rrb- and will orbit the earth at a height of 400-600 kilometres -lrb- 250-370 miles -rrb- .
they are expected to be usable for five years .
the optical satellite will be able to detect objects of just one metre -lrb- three feet -rrb- across .
japanese officials have stressed that the satellites are not to be used solely for spying on the north , noting that , for example , they can also be used to monitor major natural disasters .
but they can be used to watch for suspicious activity such as incursions by north korean spy ships , or signs of work on pyongyang 's nuclear weapons programme .
north korea has strongly protested against japan 's plans to launch the satellites , arguing that this is a sign of the country 's growing militarism .
japanese intelligence has indicated that north korea may respond with a ballistic missile test .
but the president of japan 's national space development agency -lrb- nasda -rrb- , shuichiro yamanouchi , has said that north korea has no reason to be worried , because satellite pictures of the region are already freely available .
japan currently buys commercial satellite photos from the us and france .
intelligence independence north korea 's launch of a taepodong-1 ballistic missile over japan in 1998 , however , served as a wake-up call .
" it really shocked the japanese .
they realised that they 've got to wake up and not be 100 % reliant on the us , " victor cha , professor of government and asian studies at washington dc 's georgetown university told bbc news online .
masashi nisihara , president of japan 's national defence academy , said " the idea -lrb- of the satellites -rrb- has been on the table for some time , but the ' 98 launch of north korea 's taepodong stimulated that decision . "
mr yamanouchi admitted earlier this month : " it 's a kind of technological independence .
information independence .
for the japanese it 's very important . "
the quality of the pictures they will produce is said to be inferior to that already bought from japan by the us .
there is a suggestion that nasda is not only aiming for independent surveillance capability , but to boost its drastically depleted coffers .
its budget was cut by 12 % to $ 1.4bn last year , compounding losses incurred by failed launches of four successive satellites in 1998 and 1999 .
mr cha said that the satellite industry " is a very lucrative business , so almost certainly there was a commercial consideration , but i think the proximate cause were the measures taken by north korea " .
it remains to be seen whether increasing japan 's surveillance of the north will result in yet more threatening behaviour from its neighbour .

with around 100 rodong-1 missiles reportedly deployed in north korea , capable of striking anywhere in japan , and tensions on the korean peninsula rising by the day , tokyo has good reason to want to further its knowledge of the north 's behaviour .
the first two satellites - one optical , and one radar - were launched aboard an h-2a rocket at japan 's space centre on southern tanegashima island .
if all goes to plan , two more launches are expected before march 2004 .
all four satellites will cost a total of about 250 billion yen -lrb- $ 2.05bn -rrb- and will orbit the earth at a height of 400-600 kilometres -lrb- 250-370 miles -rrb- .
they are expected to be usable for five years .
the optical satellite will be able to detect objects of just one metre -lrb- three feet -rrb- across .
japanese officials have stressed that the satellites are not to be used solely for spying on the north , noting that , for example , they can also be used to monitor major natural disasters .
but they can be used to watch for suspicious activity such as incursions by north korean spy ships , or signs of work on pyongyang 's nuclear weapons programme .
north korea has strongly protested against japan 's plans to launch the satellites , arguing that this is a sign of the country 's growing militarism .
japanese intelligence has indicated that north korea may respond with a ballistic missile test .
but the president of japan 's national space development agency -lrb- nasda -rrb- , shuichiro yamanouchi , has said that north korea has no reason to be worried , because satellite pictures of the region are already freely available .
japan currently buys commercial satellite photos from the us and france .
intelligence independence north korea 's launch of a taepodong-1 ballistic missile over japan in 1998 , however , served as a wake-up call .
" it really shocked the japanese .
they realised that they 've got to wake up and not be 100 % reliant on the us , " victor cha , professor of government and asian studies at washington dc 's georgetown university told bbc news online .
masashi nisihara , president of japan 's national defence academy , said " the idea -lrb- of the satellites -rrb- has been on the table for some time , but the ' 98 launch of north korea 's taepodong stimulated that decision . "
mr yamanouchi admitted earlier this month : " it 's a kind of technological independence .
information independence .
for the japanese it 's very important . "
the quality of the pictures they will produce is said to be inferior to that already bought from japan by the us .
there is a suggestion that nasda is not only aiming for independent surveillance capability , but to boost its drastically depleted coffers .
its budget was cut by 12 % to $ 1.4bn last year , compounding losses incurred by failed launches of four successive satellites in 1998 and 1999 .
mr cha said that the satellite industry " is a very lucrative business , so almost certainly there was a commercial consideration , but i think the proximate cause were the measures taken by north korea " .
it remains to be seen whether increasing japan 's surveillance of the north will result in yet more threatening behaviour from its neighbour .

the prison reform trust -lrb- prt -rrb- said styal prison , near wilmslow , cheshire , and buckley hall , in rochdale , greater manchester , are among eight overcrowded female prisons in the uk .
it said the number of women in jail nationally was 4,447 this week - a rise of 32 from august 2002 .
the prt said too many women criminals were being jailed and called for sentencing policy to be changed .
soaring population director juliet lyon said : " few women offenders present a real risk to the public .
" for all but the most serious and violent offenders , support and supervision centres in local communities offer the best chance for women offenders to get out of trouble and take responsibility for their lives . "
the number of women inmates has soared by 40 % in five years , according to the prt .
but it said reoffending figures from 1998 revealed 52 % had committed a crime within two years of their release .
