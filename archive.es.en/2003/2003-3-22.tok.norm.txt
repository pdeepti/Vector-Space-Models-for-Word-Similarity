a panel discussion at the leipzig book fair illuminates the history of the west 's dealings with saddam hussein .
experts highlight the failure of american policies in the crisis over iraq . the focus in leipzig this weekend is books - the business of writing them , publishing them and selling them .
but there is one uninvited guest who is doing his best to change the subject .
it is the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
" no war , " said a protest sign hung up by a group of publishers at the fair .
but the united states has said yes to war , and the subject led to the scheduling of a panel discussion titled " american and the rest of the world . "
the talk held in the peter church on thursday was led by german u.n. specialist andreas zumach , american journalist mark hertsgaard and german diplomat hans graf von sponeck , who worked for the united nations in baghdad for many years .
the picture of the united states and its motives that emerged from the talk was a dark one .
the west 's middle east partner zumach , a correspondent in geneva , said he saw the war as being the culmination of u.s. plotting .
" the policies of the united states vis-à-vis the region that we here call the middle east has followed the same pattern since the early 1950s , " zumach said .
" the central issue was : we need at least one reliable geopolitical alliance partner in this region , and that must also be a country that possesses large oil reserves and is prepared to provide us with oil for a reasonable price .
this first alliance partner was called persia , or iran .
the shah 's dictatorship was supported by all of us . "
and the term ' all of us ' includes europe , zumach added , " so we as europeans do n't make it easy on ourselves . "
alliance with iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shah 's effigy being burned outside the u.s. embassy in teheran in 1979 .
" things changed suddenly in 1979 as iran imploded during an islamic revolution .
" then one needed a new geopolitical alliance partner , " zumach said .
" he was named saddam hussein . "
things went well for 10 years , zumach said .
saddam waged war on iran with weapons that the united states and europe provided him .
saddam felt like he was the victor of the islamic world , zumach explained .
but , then , he became a problem .
the first persian gulf war and 11 years of sanctions followed .
the problem finally became so big that the united states formulated a policy in 1998 to depose him , zumach said .
" and why ? " he asked .
" because these gentlemen assumed their analysis was correct .
namely , that the united states ' most important geopolitical partner since the last gulf war , saudi arabia , would explode sooner or later because of the growing tensions in the dictatorship in riyadh and an increasingly islamic opposition .
and that one had to be prepared and come up with a substitute for saudi arabia in time .
iraq was this substitute .
but it 's not possible with the current regime .
and that 's why the current regime has to go . "
americans poorly informed most americans did n't know their government was pursuing these foreign policy aims , hertsgaard said .
" we no longer have a critical independent press in the usa , which is a big problem to our theory of government .
and you see that very clearly with the current iraq situation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white house spokesman ari fleischer " if you really want to get depressed with the united states , let me give you the following number : 45 percent of the american public now believes that saddam hussein was directly involved in the attacks of sept .
11 .
the american people believe that because over the last eight weeks the white house propaganda machine has continually sent out that message .
and , unfortunately , the press has not had the courage to stand up and simply say : that is false . "
washington 's weakness despite its military might , the participants agreed that the united states was actually an ailing , highly indebted country whose leadership was unable to effectively employ political means to win international support of a war against iraq .
this is a sign of weakness that , sponeck said , should prompt europe in particular to wake up to its responsibilities to carry out a reform of the u.n. security council and to reduce poverty in many of the world 's countries .
while the iraq war will cost around $ 200 billion , the industrial countries spend a total of only $ 50 billion yearly on aid to developing countries , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a panel discussion at the leipzig book fair illuminates the history of the west 's dealings with saddam hussein .
experts highlight the failure of american policies in the crisis over iraq . the focus in leipzig this weekend is books - the business of writing them , publishing them and selling them .
but there is one uninvited guest who is doing his best to change the subject .
it is the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
" no war , " said a protest sign hung up by a group of publishers at the fair .
but the united states has said yes to war , and the subject led to the scheduling of a panel discussion titled " american and the rest of the world . "
the talk held in the peter church on thursday was led by german u.n. specialist andreas zumach , american journalist mark hertsgaard and german diplomat hans graf von sponeck , who worked for the united nations in baghdad for many years .
the picture of the united states and its motives that emerged from the talk was a dark one .
the west 's middle east partner zumach , a correspondent in geneva , said he saw the war as being the culmination of u.s. plotting .
" the policies of the united states vis-à-vis the region that we here call the middle east has followed the same pattern since the early 1950s , " zumach said .
" the central issue was : we need at least one reliable geopolitical alliance partner in this region , and that must also be a country that possesses large oil reserves and is prepared to provide us with oil for a reasonable price .
this first alliance partner was called persia , or iran .
the shah 's dictatorship was supported by all of us . "
and the term ' all of us ' includes europe , zumach added , " so we as europeans do n't make it easy on ourselves . "

" things changed suddenly in 1979 as iran imploded during an islamic revolution .
" then one needed a new geopolitical alliance partner , " zumach said .
" he was named saddam hussein . "
things went well for 10 years , zumach said .
saddam waged war on iran with weapons that the united states and europe provided him .
saddam felt like he was the victor of the islamic world , zumach explained .
but , then , he became a problem .
the first persian gulf war and 11 years of sanctions followed .
the problem finally became so big that the united states formulated a policy in 1998 to depose him , zumach said .
" and why ? " he asked .
" because these gentlemen assumed their analysis was correct .
namely , that the united states ' most important geopolitical partner since the last gulf war , saudi arabia , would explode sooner or later because of the growing tensions in the dictatorship in riyadh and an increasingly islamic opposition .
and that one had to be prepared and come up with a substitute for saudi arabia in time .
iraq was this substitute .
but it 's not possible with the current regime .
and that 's why the current regime has to go . "
americans poorly informed most americans did n't know their government was pursuing these foreign policy aims , hertsgaard said .
" we no longer have a critical independent press in the usa , which is a big problem to our theory of government .
and you see that very clearly with the current iraq situation , " he said .

saddam waged war on iran with weapons that the united states and europe provided him .
saddam felt like he was the victor of the islamic world , zumach explained .

the first persian gulf war and 11 years of sanctions followed .
the problem finally became so big that the united states formulated a policy in 1998 to depose him , zumach said .
" and why ? " he asked .
" because these gentlemen assumed their analysis was correct .
namely , that the united states ' most important geopolitical partner since the last gulf war , saudi arabia , would explode sooner or later because of the growing tensions in the dictatorship in riyadh and an increasingly islamic opposition .
and that one had to be prepared and come up with a substitute for saudi arabia in time .
iraq was this substitute .
but it 's not possible with the current regime .
and that 's why the current regime has to go . "
americans poorly informed most americans did n't know their government was pursuing these foreign policy aims , hertsgaard said .
" we no longer have a critical independent press in the usa , which is a big problem to our theory of government .

the american people believe that because over the last eight weeks the white house propaganda machine has continually sent out that message .
and , unfortunately , the press has not had the courage to stand up and simply say : that is false . "
washington 's weakness despite its military might , the participants agreed that the united states was actually an ailing , highly indebted country whose leadership was unable to effectively employ political means to win international support of a war against iraq .
this is a sign of weakness that , sponeck said , should prompt europe in particular to wake up to its responsibilities to carry out a reform of the u.n. security council and to reduce poverty in many of the world 's countries .

a panel discussion at the leipzig book fair illuminates the history of the west 's dealings with saddam hussein .
experts highlight the failure of american policies in the crisis over iraq . the focus in leipzig this weekend is books - the business of writing them , publishing them and selling them .
but there is one uninvited guest who is doing his best to change the subject .
it is the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
" no war , " said a protest sign hung up by a group of publishers at the fair .
but the united states has said yes to war , and the subject led to the scheduling of a panel discussion titled " american and the rest of the world . "
the talk held in the peter church on thursday was led by german u.n. specialist andreas zumach , american journalist mark hertsgaard and german diplomat hans graf von sponeck , who worked for the united nations in baghdad for many years .
the picture of the united states and its motives that emerged from the talk was a dark one .
the west 's middle east partner zumach , a correspondent in geneva , said he saw the war as being the culmination of u.s. plotting .
" the policies of the united states vis-à-vis the region that we here call the middle east has followed the same pattern since the early 1950s , " zumach said .
" the central issue was : we need at least one reliable geopolitical alliance partner in this region , and that must also be a country that possesses large oil reserves and is prepared to provide us with oil for a reasonable price .

a panel discussion at the leipzig book fair illuminates the history of the west 's dealings with saddam hussein .
experts highlight the failure of american policies in the crisis over iraq . the focus in leipzig this weekend is books - the business of writing them , publishing them and selling them .
but there is one uninvited guest who is doing his best to change the subject .
it is the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
" no war , " said a protest sign hung up by a group of publishers at the fair .
but the united states has said yes to war , and the subject led to the scheduling of a panel discussion titled " american and the rest of the world . "
the talk held in the peter church on thursday was led by german u.n. specialist andreas zumach , american journalist mark hertsgaard and german diplomat hans graf von sponeck , who worked for the united nations in baghdad for many years .
the picture of the united states and its motives that emerged from the talk was a dark one .
the west 's middle east partner zumach , a correspondent in geneva , said he saw the war as being the culmination of u.s. plotting .
" the policies of the united states vis-à-vis the region that we here call the middle east has followed the same pattern since the early 1950s , " zumach said .
" the central issue was : we need at least one reliable geopolitical alliance partner in this region , and that must also be a country that possesses large oil reserves and is prepared to provide us with oil for a reasonable price .
this first alliance partner was called persia , or iran .
the shah 's dictatorship was supported by all of us . "
and the term ' all of us ' includes europe , zumach added , " so we as europeans do n't make it easy on ourselves . "
alliance with iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shah 's effigy being burned outside the u.s. embassy in teheran in 1979 .
" things changed suddenly in 1979 as iran imploded during an islamic revolution .
" then one needed a new geopolitical alliance partner , " zumach said .
" he was named saddam hussein . "
things went well for 10 years , zumach said .
saddam waged war on iran with weapons that the united states and europe provided him .
saddam felt like he was the victor of the islamic world , zumach explained .
but , then , he became a problem .
the first persian gulf war and 11 years of sanctions followed .
the problem finally became so big that the united states formulated a policy in 1998 to depose him , zumach said .
" and why ? " he asked .
" because these gentlemen assumed their analysis was correct .
namely , that the united states ' most important geopolitical partner since the last gulf war , saudi arabia , would explode sooner or later because of the growing tensions in the dictatorship in riyadh and an increasingly islamic opposition .
and that one had to be prepared and come up with a substitute for saudi arabia in time .
iraq was this substitute .
but it 's not possible with the current regime .
and that 's why the current regime has to go . "
americans poorly informed most americans did n't know their government was pursuing these foreign policy aims , hertsgaard said .
" we no longer have a critical independent press in the usa , which is a big problem to our theory of government .
and you see that very clearly with the current iraq situation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white house spokesman ari fleischer " if you really want to get depressed with the united states , let me give you the following number : 45 percent of the american public now believes that saddam hussein was directly involved in the attacks of sept .
11 .
the american people believe that because over the last eight weeks the white house propaganda machine has continually sent out that message .
and , unfortunately , the press has not had the courage to stand up and simply say : that is false . "
washington 's weakness despite its military might , the participants agreed that the united states was actually an ailing , highly indebted country whose leadership was unable to effectively employ political means to win international support of a war against iraq .
this is a sign of weakness that , sponeck said , should prompt europe in particular to wake up to its responsibilities to carry out a reform of the u.n. security council and to reduce poverty in many of the world 's countries .
while the iraq war will cost around $ 200 billion , the industrial countries spend a total of only $ 50 billion yearly on aid to developing countries , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a panel discussion at the leipzig book fair illuminates the history of the west 's dealings with saddam hussein .
experts highlight the failure of american policies in the crisis over iraq . the focus in leipzig this weekend is books - the business of writing them , publishing them and selling them .
but there is one uninvited guest who is doing his best to change the subject .
it is the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
" no war , " said a protest sign hung up by a group of publishers at the fair .
but the united states has said yes to war , and the subject led to the scheduling of a panel discussion titled " american and the rest of the world . "
the talk held in the peter church on thursday was led by german u.n. specialist andreas zumach , american journalist mark hertsgaard and german diplomat hans graf von sponeck , who worked for the united nations in baghdad for many years .
the picture of the united states and its motives that emerged from the talk was a dark one .
the west 's middle east partner zumach , a correspondent in geneva , said he saw the war as being the culmination of u.s. plotting .
" the policies of the united states vis-à-vis the region that we here call the middle east has followed the same pattern since the early 1950s , " zumach said .
" the central issue was : we need at least one reliable geopolitical alliance partner in this region , and that must also be a country that possesses large oil reserves and is prepared to provide us with oil for a reasonable price .
this first alliance partner was called persia , or iran .
the shah 's dictatorship was supported by all of us . "
and the term ' all of us ' includes europe , zumach added , " so we as europeans do n't make it easy on ourselves . "
alliance with iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shah 's effigy being burned outside the u.s. embassy in teheran in 1979 .
" things changed suddenly in 1979 as iran imploded during an islamic revolution .
" then one needed a new geopolitical alliance partner , " zumach said .
" he was named saddam hussein . "
things went well for 10 years , zumach said .
saddam waged war on iran with weapons that the united states and europe provided him .
saddam felt like he was the victor of the islamic world , zumach explained .
but , then , he became a problem .
the first persian gulf war and 11 years of sanctions followed .
the problem finally became so big that the united states formulated a policy in 1998 to depose him , zumach said .
" and why ? " he asked .
" because these gentlemen assumed their analysis was correct .
namely , that the united states ' most important geopolitical partner since the last gulf war , saudi arabia , would explode sooner or later because of the growing tensions in the dictatorship in riyadh and an increasingly islamic opposition .
and that one had to be prepared and come up with a substitute for saudi arabia in time .
iraq was this substitute .
but it 's not possible with the current regime .
and that 's why the current regime has to go . "
americans poorly informed most americans did n't know their government was pursuing these foreign policy aims , hertsgaard said .
" we no longer have a critical independent press in the usa , which is a big problem to our theory of government .
and you see that very clearly with the current iraq situation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white house spokesman ari fleischer " if you really want to get depressed with the united states , let me give you the following number : 45 percent of the american public now believes that saddam hussein was directly involved in the attacks of sept .
11 .
the american people believe that because over the last eight weeks the white house propaganda machine has continually sent out that message .
and , unfortunately , the press has not had the courage to stand up and simply say : that is false . "

but , then , he became a problem .
the first persian gulf war and 11 years of sanctions followed .
the problem finally became so big that the united states formulated a policy in 1998 to depose him , zumach said .
" and why ? " he asked .
" because these gentlemen assumed their analysis was correct .
namely , that the united states ' most important geopolitical partner since the last gulf war , saudi arabia , would explode sooner or later because of the growing tensions in the dictatorship in riyadh and an increasingly islamic opposition .
and that one had to be prepared and come up with a substitute for saudi arabia in time .
iraq was this substitute .
but it 's not possible with the current regime .
and that 's why the current regime has to go . "
americans poorly informed most americans did n't know their government was pursuing these foreign policy aims , hertsgaard said .
" we no longer have a critical independent press in the usa , which is a big problem to our theory of government .
and you see that very clearly with the current iraq situation , " he said .

the american people believe that because over the last eight weeks the white house propaganda machine has continually sent out that message .

washington 's weakness despite its military might , the participants agreed that the united states was actually an ailing , highly indebted country whose leadership was unable to effectively employ political means to win international support of a war against iraq .
this is a sign of weakness that , sponeck said , should prompt europe in particular to wake up to its responsibilities to carry out a reform of the u.n. security council and to reduce poverty in many of the world 's countries .

a panel discussion at the leipzig book fair illuminates the history of the west 's dealings with saddam hussein .
experts highlight the failure of american policies in the crisis over iraq . the focus in leipzig this weekend is books - the business of writing them , publishing them and selling them .
but there is one uninvited guest who is doing his best to change the subject .
it is the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
" no war , " said a protest sign hung up by a group of publishers at the fair .
but the united states has said yes to war , and the subject led to the scheduling of a panel discussion titled " american and the rest of the world . "
the talk held in the peter church on thursday was led by german u.n. specialist andreas zumach , american journalist mark hertsgaard and german diplomat hans graf von sponeck , who worked for the united nations in baghdad for many years .
the picture of the united states and its motives that emerged from the talk was a dark one .
the west 's middle east partner zumach , a correspondent in geneva , said he saw the war as being the culmination of u.s. plotting .
" the policies of the united states vis-à-vis the region that we here call the middle east has followed the same pattern since the early 1950s , " zumach said .
" the central issue was : we need at least one reliable geopolitical alliance partner in this region , and that must also be a country that possesses large oil reserves and is prepared to provide us with oil for a reasonable price .
this first alliance partner was called persia , or iran .
the shah 's dictatorship was supported by all of us . "

a panel discussion at the leipzig book fair illuminates the history of the west 's dealings with saddam hussein .
experts highlight the failure of american policies in the crisis over iraq . the focus in leipzig this weekend is books - the business of writing them , publishing them and selling them .
but there is one uninvited guest who is doing his best to change the subject .
it is the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
" no war , " said a protest sign hung up by a group of publishers at the fair .
but the united states has said yes to war , and the subject led to the scheduling of a panel discussion titled " american and the rest of the world . "
the talk held in the peter church on thursday was led by german u.n. specialist andreas zumach , american journalist mark hertsgaard and german diplomat hans graf von sponeck , who worked for the united nations in baghdad for many years .
the picture of the united states and its motives that emerged from the talk was a dark one .
the west 's middle east partner zumach , a correspondent in geneva , said he saw the war as being the culmination of u.s. plotting .
" the policies of the united states vis-à-vis the region that we here call the middle east has followed the same pattern since the early 1950s , " zumach said .
" the central issue was : we need at least one reliable geopolitical alliance partner in this region , and that must also be a country that possesses large oil reserves and is prepared to provide us with oil for a reasonable price .
this first alliance partner was called persia , or iran .
the shah 's dictatorship was supported by all of us . "
and the term ' all of us ' includes europe , zumach added , " so we as europeans do n't make it easy on ourselves . "
alliance with iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shah 's effigy being burned outside the u.s. embassy in teheran in 1979 .
" things changed suddenly in 1979 as iran imploded during an islamic revolution .
" then one needed a new geopolitical alliance partner , " zumach said .
" he was named saddam hussein . "
things went well for 10 years , zumach said .
saddam waged war on iran with weapons that the united states and europe provided him .
saddam felt like he was the victor of the islamic world , zumach explained .
but , then , he became a problem .
the first persian gulf war and 11 years of sanctions followed .
the problem finally became so big that the united states formulated a policy in 1998 to depose him , zumach said .
" and why ? " he asked .
" because these gentlemen assumed their analysis was correct .
namely , that the united states ' most important geopolitical partner since the last gulf war , saudi arabia , would explode sooner or later because of the growing tensions in the dictatorship in riyadh and an increasingly islamic opposition .
and that one had to be prepared and come up with a substitute for saudi arabia in time .
iraq was this substitute .
but it 's not possible with the current regime .
and that 's why the current regime has to go . "
americans poorly informed most americans did n't know their government was pursuing these foreign policy aims , hertsgaard said .
" we no longer have a critical independent press in the usa , which is a big problem to our theory of government .
and you see that very clearly with the current iraq situation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white house spokesman ari fleischer " if you really want to get depressed with the united states , let me give you the following number : 45 percent of the american public now believes that saddam hussein was directly involved in the attacks of sept .
11 .
the american people believe that because over the last eight weeks the white house propaganda machine has continually sent out that message .
and , unfortunately , the press has not had the courage to stand up and simply say : that is false . "
washington 's weakness despite its military might , the participants agreed that the united states was actually an ailing , highly indebted country whose leadership was unable to effectively employ political means to win international support of a war against iraq .
this is a sign of weakness that , sponeck said , should prompt europe in particular to wake up to its responsibilities to carry out a reform of the u.n. security council and to reduce poverty in many of the world 's countries .
while the iraq war will cost around $ 200 billion , the industrial countries spend a total of only $ 50 billion yearly on aid to developing countries , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" i did n't know anything about the problem before .
" people become homeless for all sorts of reasons .
" but we decided to concentrate on people who had lost their homes as a result of heroin addiction .
" it 's easy to get hold of heroin in north wales , like anywhere else , and the effect it has on our communities can be totally devastating . "
the rts jury said they were " impressed by the winning programme 's compelling intimacy and total lack of sentimentality " .

the passionate conservationist will present restoration , a new bbc 2 series where viewers will be asked to choose one of 30 historic buildings that deserve to be rescued from ruin .
each will have a celebrity advocate , although it is yet to be decided who will fight the corner for llanelly house .
after decades of neglect , the prominent 18th century grade one listed building in the centre of the town has been recognised as the finest example of its kind in wales .
griff rhys jones will present the show it was bought in 1998 by llanelli town council , but it is estimated that returning it to its former glory as a cultural and heritage centre could cost in excess of £ 3m .
ten one-hour programmes will each be devoted to a geographical area of the uk - with a whole programme dedicated to wales .
winning building in the welsh programme , llanelly house will be competing with the faenol estate near caernarfon and a joint scheme involving plas mountain copper mine and amlwch port .
every style will be featured , from cottages and castles to factories and chapels .
at the end of each programme viewers will be invited to vote for the building they would most like to see restored .
each winner will go through to a final shortlist of 10 when the series will climax with a live programme where the public will decide which property is most worthy of restoration .
the project director at llanelly house is william wilkins , the man behind middleton - the national botanic garden of wales .
" it 's the finest example of an 18th century town house in wales , " he said .
paintings and panelling " the restoration of a house like this is of considerable value in terms of the llanelli economy and the regeneration of the town centre .
" to bring a first class building like this into play would enhance the image of llanelli and west wales .
" one of the things that is so exciting is we have uncovered 18th century paintings and panelling that is of immense interest . "
completed in 1714 , the three-storey property was built for sir thomas stepney , but has since been broken up into a mix of commercial and residential uses .
the town council is applying for funding from the project from both the heritage lottery fund and cadw .
restoration will be shown on bbc 2 during the summer .

the passionate conservationist will present restoration , a new bbc 2 series where viewers will be asked to choose one of 30 historic buildings that deserve to be rescued from ruin .
each will have a celebrity advocate , although it is yet to be decided who will fight the corner for llanelly house .
after decades of neglect , the prominent 18th century grade one listed building in the centre of the town has been recognised as the finest example of its kind in wales .
it was bought in 1998 by llanelli town council , but it is estimated that returning it to its former glory as a cultural and heritage centre could cost in excess of £ 3m .
ten one-hour programmes will each be devoted to a geographical area of the uk - with a whole programme dedicated to wales .
winning building in the welsh programme , llanelly house will be competing with the faenol estate near caernarfon and a joint scheme involving plas mountain copper mine and amlwch port .
every style will be featured , from cottages and castles to factories and chapels .
at the end of each programme viewers will be invited to vote for the building they would most like to see restored .
each winner will go through to a final shortlist of 10 when the series will climax with a live programme where the public will decide which property is most worthy of restoration .
the project director at llanelly house is william wilkins , the man behind middleton - the national botanic garden of wales .
" it 's the finest example of an 18th century town house in wales , " he said .
paintings and panelling " the restoration of a house like this is of considerable value in terms of the llanelli economy and the regeneration of the town centre .
" to bring a first class building like this into play would enhance the image of llanelli and west wales .
" one of the things that is so exciting is we have uncovered 18th century paintings and panelling that is of immense interest . "
completed in 1714 , the three-storey property was built for sir thomas stepney , but has since been broken up into a mix of commercial and residential uses .
the town council is applying for funding from the project from both the heritage lottery fund and cadw .
restoration will be shown on bbc 2 during the summer .

but independent schools are being told not to encourage pupils to go there .
here , former comprehensive pupil sarah treanor describes her experience of getting to bristol on a low offer : when , in 2001 i first decided to study at bristol university , it had been firmly placed in the " elitist " bracket .
in the wake of the oxford laura spence admissions controversy , and with little over 50 % of intake from the state sector , a fee-paying schools bias was perceived .
now , two years into my degree , headlines are again being created with accusations of social engineering and a deliberate erosion of standards .
reality it may instinctively appear unfair that some pupils are offered lower grades than others .
however , as a former comprehensive student who received a lower offer from bristol than many private , -lrb- or high-achieving state school -rrb- pupils , for me these criticisms do not reflect the realities of the application procedure .
the government has recognised that too few students have traditionally applied to certain institutions from the state sector .
a tutor commented that the choice is sometimes impossible the previous reliance on grades alone for admissions has seen many highly able students perhaps unfairly rejected .
this was often the case in my sixth form , with many pupils missing out by just one or two points .
therefore , the decision by bristol to look at applications in the context of school averages may not seem ideal , but in my view is a far better indicator of the individual pupil 's academic potential .
arguably , from a school with a grade ddd average , a pupil who is predicted abb is showing greater potential than a pupil who is predicted straight a grades from a school where this is the norm .
it is now proposed that natural ability becomes the single most important determinate for success in a degree .
few contact hours with my lecturers and tutors mean independent learning is vital , something often started at state sixth forms , where there is not always the time or resources for teachers to offer much individual aid or coaching .
although important indicators , there are other skills needed for a successful university student than outstanding results .
arbitrary system the former criticisms of bristol 's ratio of state to private intake , and " oxbridge reject " tag , have only been addressed by encouraging applicants from a broad social cross section .
yet as many schools do not achieve comparable examination results , there must be real incentives for pupils to apply .
this should not be regarded as a penalty on bright students from any school , as has recently been suggested , but an opportunity to correct the previous imbalance created by an arbitrary system .
this admissions policy does not work by quotas , or indicate that fee-paying school pupils will be denied an offer .
although disappointing for a student to be rejected by any university , highly publicised recent cases of very academic students not receiving a place are very common in all types of sixth form , and do not necessarily reflect a trend .
with four predicted a grades and taking two s-levels , i was rejected by ucl , yet do not consider this to be the result of any underlying bias !
supposed one-off stories do not illustrate the realities of applying to university , which many regard as a lottery .
the sheer volume and quality of applications to popular universities makes the admissions procedure more challenging than ever for the student .
often nearly all applicants will have a " perfect " score .
a tutor commented to me that the choice is sometimes impossible .
these initiatives are not completely new or unique , kings college in cambridge has been operating a similar scheme for some time , as have nottingham university and others , but they provide applicants with a more open and informed outlook on the whole process of admissions .
