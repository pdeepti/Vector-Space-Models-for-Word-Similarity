if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday . a day after the u.s. congress requested their president to seek nato help in stabilizing iraq , german politicians across the political spectrum set conditions . " we can only discuss such thing if there is a demand by the united nations , " said chancellor gerhard schröder in a television interview friday evening . the social democratic chancellor got not only support from within his government coalition , but from opposition politicians as well .
after splitting on the question of whether the u.s. should use military force against iraq half a year ago , the government and opposition have agreed that the united nations needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . a government spokesman said friday that a clear u.n. mandate and a transition government in iraq are among the conditions that germany would need to even consider the deployment of nato troops . " currently there is no change in our ... position , " schröder said . diplomatic opening for europe analysts see the request by the u.s. senate , made after testimony by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and the commander in iraq , general tommy franks , as a chance for europe to get what it has asked for since the end of the war . not only germany , but france and even the u.k. have called for a " central role " for the united nations in iraq . all three countries are in the nato and the approval of a deployment would have to get their yes vote , whether or not they contribute troops .
there are currently spanish , italian , polish and danish soldiers working side-by-side with u.s. and british troops in iraq .
but the americans have bore the brunt of the casualties .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since president george w. bush announced the end of main fighting in iraq in may . if reports are to be believed , the morale among the 146,000 soldiers currently stationed there is plunging .
costs are slowly getting out of control as well .
american taxpayers are having to spend $ 3.9 billion a month to support the thousands of troops and equipment stationed in iraq . germany 's troop deployment limited germany 's armed forces have been overstretched as well .
with more than 8,000 troops in the balkans , afghanistan and as far down as the horn of africa , the possibility that germany can contribute more is doubtful . " i think our friends know that we have limited resources , " said wolfgang schäuble , the parliamentary foreign policy spokesman in germany 's christian democratic union . but should the united nations get its desired mandate , germany would face pressure to contribute troops , a government source said in the saturday edition of the mass-circulation newspaper bild . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. expected to ask germany , france to send troops to iraq with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war .

if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday . a day after the u.s. congress requested their president to seek nato help in stabilizing iraq , german politicians across the political spectrum set conditions . " we can only discuss such thing if there is a demand by the united nations , " said chancellor gerhard schröder in a television interview friday evening . the social democratic chancellor got not only support from within his government coalition , but from opposition politicians as well .
after splitting on the question of whether the u.s. should use military force against iraq half a year ago , the government and opposition have agreed that the united nations needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . a government spokesman said friday that a clear u.n. mandate and a transition government in iraq are among the conditions that germany would need to even consider the deployment of nato troops . " currently there is no change in our ... position , " schröder said . diplomatic opening for europe analysts see the request by the u.s. senate , made after testimony by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and the commander in iraq , general tommy franks , as a chance for europe to get what it has asked for since the end of the war . not only germany , but france and even the u.k. have called for a " central role " for the united nations in iraq . all three countries are in the nato and the approval of a deployment would have to get their yes vote , whether or not they contribute troops .
there are currently spanish , italian , polish and danish soldiers working side-by-side with u.s. and british troops in iraq .
but the americans have bore the brunt of the casualties .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since president george w. bush announced the end of main fighting in iraq in may . if reports are to be believed , the morale among the 146,000 soldiers currently stationed there is plunging .
costs are slowly getting out of control as well .
american taxpayers are having to spend $ 3.9 billion a month to support the thousands of troops and equipment stationed in iraq . germany 's troop deployment limited germany 's armed forces have been overstretched as well .
with more than 8,000 troops in the balkans , afghanistan and as far down as the horn of africa , the possibility that germany can contribute more is doubtful . " i think our friends know that we have limited resources , " said wolfgang schäuble , the parliamentary foreign policy spokesman in germany 's christian democratic union . but should the united nations get its desired mandate , germany would face pressure to contribute troops , a government source said in the saturday edition of the mass-circulation newspaper bild . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. expected to ask germany , france to send troops to iraq with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war .

if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday . a day after the u.s. congress requested their president to seek nato help in stabilizing iraq , german politicians across the political spectrum set conditions . " we can only discuss such thing if there is a demand by the united nations , " said chancellor gerhard schröder in a television interview friday evening . the social democratic chancellor got not only support from within his government coalition , but from opposition politicians as well .
after splitting on the question of whether the u.s. should use military force against iraq half a year ago , the government and opposition have agreed that the united nations needs to play the central role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . a government spokesman said friday that a clear u.n. mandate and a transition government in iraq are among the conditions that germany would need to even consider the deployment of nato troops . " currently there is no change in our ... position , " schröder said . diplomatic opening for europe analysts see the request by the u.s. senate , made after testimony by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and the commander in iraq , general tommy franks , as a chance for europe to get what it has asked for since the end of the war . not only germany , but france and even the u.k. have called for a " central role " for the united nations in iraq . all three countries are in the nato and the approval of a deployment would have to get their yes vote , whether or not they contribute troops .
there are currently spanish , italian , polish and danish soldiers working side-by-side with u.s. and british troops in iraq .
but the americans have bore the brunt of the casualties .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since president george w. bush announced the end of main fighting in iraq in may . if reports are to be believed , the morale among the 146,000 soldiers currently stationed there is plunging .
costs are slowly getting out of control as well .
american taxpayers are having to spend $ 3.9 billion a month to support the thousands of troops and equipment stationed in iraq . germany 's troop deployment limited germany 's armed forces have been overstretched as well .
with more than 8,000 troops in the balkans , afghanistan and as far down as the horn of africa , the possibility that germany can contribute more is doubtful . " i think our friends know that we have limited resources , " said wolfgang schäuble , the parliamentary foreign policy spokesman in germany 's christian democratic union . but should the united nations get its desired mandate , germany would face pressure to contribute troops , a government source said in the saturday edition of the mass-circulation newspaper bild . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. expected to ask germany , france to send troops to iraq with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war .

mr howard cited the now discredited claims that iraq tried to buy uranium from the african country of niger when he was making the case for sending troops to iraq during an address to parliament .
howard committed 2,000 troops to the us-led war effort in fact , the office of national assessments - which directly advises mr howard on intelligence matters - knew the information was doubtful , but failed to tell the prime minister .
other spy agencies also failed to pass on warnings .
mr howard apologised for misleading parliament , but he says it was not deliberate and , even if he had known , he says his decision to send australian troops to iraq would not have been affected .
the main opposition labour party says mr howard has been loose with the truth when it comes to issues of national security , but the reality is that the prime minister is under nothing like the sort of pressure facing his british counterpart , tony blair .
there is no sign of dissent in the governing liberal and national party coalition , and mr howard has not faced any cabinet resignations .
the labour party is relatively weak and mr howard has a commanding lead in opinion polls .
but it is embarrassing at best that the prime minister was never told that the claims about african uranium were suspect - even though australian intelligence organisations had known this for several months .

the appeal court in casablanca also handed down prison sentences - ranging from 12 months to life - to another 21 members of salafia jihadia .
none of the accused were involved in the may bombings , which killed more than 40 people .
they were already in prison awaiting trial , having been arrested on charges ranging from murder to belonging to a criminal gang .

salafia jihadia has been identified by the moroccan authorities as the main organisation behind the casablanca attacks .

one of them , youssef fikri , had boasted of his crimes from his cell just a month before the suicide bombings .
in a letter to a newspaper , he confessed that he had killed one man for being homosexual and another for making disrespectful remarks about islam .
the killings were part of his group 's attempt to impose their harsh interpretation of islam on the poor neighbourhoods of casablanca in which they lived , says the bbc 's sebastian usher .

in a statement , george tenet said cia officials had failed to prevent the allegation from being inserted into the president 's state of the union address in january , despite having doubts about its validity .
this , he said , was not the level of certainty required for presidential speeches .
the statement came as senior democrats called for an independent inquiry into the way the bush administration made the case for war .
the bbc 's rob watson in washington says the white house strategy is clear - to put an end to what has become an increasingly embarrassing row , the cia has been assigned the blame .
but there are signs that mr tenet 's admission may not bring an end to the controversy , our correspondent adds .
british claims president bush has denied that he knowingly gave out false information .
in his january address , mr bush said : " the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
mr tenet , in his statement , said that although the president 's words were factually correct - in the sense they attributed the allegation to the british government - they should never have been included in the speech , given the long-held doubts that us intelligence had about britain 's claims .
tenet statement timeline : uranium row the british government stands by the allegation .
prime minister tony blair 's official spokesman has said britain had separate intelligence from that of the americans .
the white house acknowledged for the first time earlier this week that the claim about iraq seeking to buy uranium from niger might be wrong .
before mr tenet made his statement , some us media reports were suggesting that the cia had advised the white house to remove the claims from the speech .
asked about this during a visit to uganda , mr bush replied : " i gave a speech to the nation that was cleared by the intelligence services . "
he did not answer when pressed on how the erroneous material came to be included in the address , stressing instead that his government took the right decision to invade iraq .
changes made mr bush 's national security adviser condoleezza rice insisted the president " did not knowingly say anything that we knew to be false " .
putting the onus of responsibility on the intelligence services , she reiterated that the cia had vetted the speech and cleared it " in its entirety " .
if anyone had any doubts about the uranium claim , " those doubts were not communicated to the president , " ms rice told reporters .
however , she said the cia did make some changes to that particular sentence in the speech .
" some specifics about amount and place were taken out , " she said .
" with the changes in that sentence , the speech was cleared . "
senior us democrats are demanding to know what mr bush knew about the allegation , and who pressed for it to be included in the state of the union address , despite the doubts of us intelligence .
one of the contenders for the democratic presidential nomination , howard dean , has demanded resignations over the issue .
senator joseph lieberman , another democratic presidential hopeful , said the controversy " breaks the basic bond of trust we must have with our leaders in times of war and terrorism " .
our correspondent says that most worryingly of all , perhaps , for president bush there now appears to be a shift in public opinion with the latest polls showing that a majority of americans now believe the white house exaggerated the threat posed by saddam hussein .

in a statement , george tenet said cia officials had failed to prevent the allegation from being inserted into the president 's state of the union address in january , despite having doubts about its validity .
this , he said , was not the level of certainty required for presidential speeches .
the statement came as senior democrats called for an independent inquiry into the way the bush administration made the case for war .
the bbc 's rob watson in washington says the white house strategy is clear - to put an end to what has become an increasingly embarrassing row , the cia has been assigned the blame .
but there are signs that mr tenet 's admission may not bring an end to the controversy , our correspondent adds .
british claims president bush has denied that he knowingly gave out false information .
in his january address , mr bush said : " the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
mr tenet , in his statement , said that although the president 's words were factually correct - in the sense they attributed the allegation to the british government - they should never have been included in the speech , given the long-held doubts that us intelligence had about britain 's claims .
tenet statement timeline : uranium row the british government stands by the allegation .
prime minister tony blair 's official spokesman has said britain had separate intelligence from that of the americans .
the white house acknowledged for the first time earlier this week that the claim about iraq seeking to buy uranium from niger might be wrong .
before mr tenet made his statement , some us media reports were suggesting that the cia had advised the white house to remove the claims from the speech .
asked about this during a visit to uganda , mr bush replied : " i gave a speech to the nation that was cleared by the intelligence services . "
he did not answer when pressed on how the erroneous material came to be included in the address , stressing instead that his government took the right decision to invade iraq .
changes made mr bush 's national security adviser condoleezza rice insisted the president " did not knowingly say anything that we knew to be false " .
putting the onus of responsibility on the intelligence services , she reiterated that the cia had vetted the speech and cleared it " in its entirety " .
if anyone had any doubts about the uranium claim , " those doubts were not communicated to the president , " ms rice told reporters .
however , she said the cia did make some changes to that particular sentence in the speech .
" some specifics about amount and place were taken out , " she said .
" with the changes in that sentence , the speech was cleared . "
senior us democrats are demanding to know what mr bush knew about the allegation , and who pressed for it to be included in the state of the union address , despite the doubts of us intelligence .
one of the contenders for the democratic presidential nomination , howard dean , has demanded resignations over the issue .
senator joseph lieberman , another democratic presidential hopeful , said the controversy " breaks the basic bond of trust we must have with our leaders in times of war and terrorism " .
our correspondent says that most worryingly of all , perhaps , for president bush there now appears to be a shift in public opinion with the latest polls showing that a majority of americans now believe the white house exaggerated the threat posed by saddam hussein .

under the plan , western sahara would be granted a limited form of autonomy from morocco followed later by a referendum on independence from , or integration with morocco .
us diplomats have circulated a draft resolution endorsing the plan , which was put forward earlier this year by un special envoy and former us secretary of state james baker .
the decision by the independence movement to support the peace plan was the cause for mild celebration among some security council diplomats .
but others , who have grown used to the long and tortuous negotiations over this territory in north-west africa , are more circumspect .
they welcome the flexibility shown by polisario , but point out that morocco - the other factor in this equation - has signalled no enthusiasm for the plan .
if the un resolution is adopted , it would endorse the baker plan and call on all parties to the dispute to work with the un to ensure its implementation .
some diplomats have voiced concern that this might appear to the moroccans as an attempt to impose a solution on them without their agreement .
morocco 's supporters on the security council , who include the permanent member , france , are likely to defend their position should it appear to come under threat .
even the most optimistic diplomats acknowledge that these latest developments may not be the breakthrough many have been hoping for .

the plans announced last week by the government included extra lanes on the m1 from london to milton keynes , on the m25 , a12 from london to ipswich , and the a120 .
but proposals to fully dual the a47 from norwich to peterborough have been rejected at this stage .
now the plans have been given the backing of the east of england development agency .
transport plans the widening of the m1 between the m25 and milton keynes in buckinghamshire to four lanes at a cost of £ 623m a £ 246m package of improvements to the a12 corridor , including the upgrade of the a12 to dual three lanes between the m25 and chelmsford in essex dualling the a120 between braintree and marks tey in essex at a cost of £ 203m dunstable northern bypass linking the a5 to m1 in bedfordshire - £ 48m dualling eight miles of the a421 between the m1 and bedford - £ 171m plans to widen most of the remaining three-lane sections of london 's orbital m25 to four lanes with £ 1.7bn investment over the next decade steve cox , eeda 's head of urban renaissance , said : " poor transport infrastructure has been highlighted by business as a key issue and a major barrier to productivity and competitiveness .
" these announcements go some way to addressing the region 's transport needs .
" eeda and partners will continue to work with the government to bring forward rail and other public transport priorities as well as other road improvements needed to support the region 's continued progress .
" early delivery of improvements to the a47 between peterborough and norwich will form an important part of these discussions . "
but the plans faced criticism from environmental groups .
corinne meakins , regional policy officer for the campaign to protect rural england , told bbc news online : " all the roads planned for the east will have an impact on the countryside in the region and will mean a loss of tranquillity . "

but although general musharraf attended their latest tour , the band have insisted they remain as committed to their often-controversial political message as ever and have not become part of the country 's establishment .
junoon are famed for publicly raising views on issues that many in pakistan would rather be kept quiet , such as hiv / aids , the kashmir dispute , and corruption .
they dismissed general musharraf 's attendance at their gig as little more than a stunt .
" the establishment has joined us , " guitarist salman ahmed told bbc world service 's the ticket programme .
" what it says is pop culture drives politics , so strongly , anywhere in the world right now , " vocalist ali azmat added .
aids mission junoon are the biggest-selling group in all asia and have a massive fan base among the young in the subcontinent .
their high-profile status led , two years ago , to them becoming goodwill ambassadors for the un on the issue of hiv / aids .
ahmed , who attended medical college before joining the band , said that junoon 's high-profile status conferred special duties on the band .
