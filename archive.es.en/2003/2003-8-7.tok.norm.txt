while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .

robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .

as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .

the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .

the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .

their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .

the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .
or expect the same quality and quantity of work from your staff while they slowly melt in the summer ’ s onslaught .
there is an alternative , of course . heavy investment in the electrical fan market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de up in flames : fires ravage southern europe as the mercury climbs higher and higher in europe , forest fires rage across the southern parts of spain and portugal .

so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .
or expect the same quality and quantity of work from your staff while they slowly melt in the summer ’ s onslaught .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .
or expect the same quality and quantity of work from your staff while they slowly melt in the summer ’ s onslaught .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .
and even the recent spat between their country and italy hasn ’ t stopped 10 percent of all german travelers heading to silvio berlusconi ’ s homeland .
other popular spots include croatia , bulgaria and turkey , while more than a third of german holiday makers choose to travel within their own country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well . dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .

the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .

the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 germans plead off work as heat wave stifles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what german employees would rather do than sweat away in their offices .
in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .
or expect the same quality and quantity of work from your staff while they slowly melt in the summer ’ s onslaught .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .

elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "

both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .
and even the recent spat between their country and italy hasn ’ t stopped 10 percent of all german travelers heading to silvio berlusconi ’ s homeland .
other popular spots include croatia , bulgaria and turkey , while more than a third of german holiday makers choose to travel within their own country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well . dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .

the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .

according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .
or expect the same quality and quantity of work from your staff while they slowly melt in the summer ’ s onslaught .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .

but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .

taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .

so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .
and even the recent spat between their country and italy hasn ’ t stopped 10 percent of all german travelers heading to silvio berlusconi ’ s homeland .
other popular spots include croatia , bulgaria and turkey , while more than a third of german holiday makers choose to travel within their own country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .

while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .

economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .

" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .
and even the recent spat between their country and italy hasn ’ t stopped 10 percent of all german travelers heading to silvio berlusconi ’ s homeland .
other popular spots include croatia , bulgaria and turkey , while more than a third of german holiday makers choose to travel within their own country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .

according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 germans plead off work as heat wave stifles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is what german employees would rather do than sweat away in their offices .
in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .
or expect the same quality and quantity of work from your staff while they slowly melt in the summer ’ s onslaught .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .
and even the recent spat between their country and italy hasn ’ t stopped 10 percent of all german travelers heading to silvio berlusconi ’ s homeland .
other popular spots include croatia , bulgaria and turkey , while more than a third of german holiday makers choose to travel within their own country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .
or expect the same quality and quantity of work from your staff while they slowly melt in the summer ’ s onslaught .
there is an alternative , of course . heavy investment in the electrical fan market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de up in flames : fires ravage southern europe as the mercury climbs higher and higher in europe , forest fires rage across the southern parts of spain and portugal .

this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .
and even the recent spat between their country and italy hasn ’ t stopped 10 percent of all german travelers heading to silvio berlusconi ’ s homeland .

" this is not a comeback .

the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .

so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .

cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.08.2003 kraftwerk is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : the forefathers of electronic music .
for almost two decades , the legendary german electronic formation kraftwerk was silent .
now , the pioneers of electronica have returned with a new album top germany 's charts . anyone who may have claimed that kraftwerk had disappeared from the musical landscape is now eating their words .
" this is not a comeback .
we were never gone , " kraftwerk 's ralf hütter said in a statement .
the founding fathers of electronic music released their new album tour de france soundtracks this week .
it marks the first kraftwerk studio album since 1986 's badly-received electric café .
the centennial of the tour de france this summer was the ideal opportunity for the avid cyclists to come out with new material .
but the idea was actually an old one .
the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well .

in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot . when parched regions of europe burst into flame , previously dam-busting rivers are reduced to dry beds and the subject of failing crops makes it to the agendas of worried politicians , you know that it must be pretty hot .
but despite disaster and drought , germans , who are experiencing one of their hottest summers ever , are expected to keep working . but respite may be at hand if some of the nation ’ s politicians get their way .
as germany heads into a week where the forecasted weather is expected to challenge the country ’ s record temperature of 40.2 degrees celsius , politicians from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the green party -lrb- the junior party in the ruling coalition -rrb- have come to the aid of the people , calling for free days for employees when the heat gets too much . “ bosses , have a heart for your workers ! ” said the cdu ’ s christoph böhr .
“ the hours they now spend in the swimming pool can be made up later in the cooler time of the year . ”
hubert ulrich of the greens also appealed to employees : “ when possible , give the people time off because of the heat . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heat blurs the view of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate .
the berlin administration has already reacted to the suffering of employees in governmental buildings as they sweat away under extreme temperatures . considering the welfare of the staff and employees , interior senator ehrhart körting has decided that free time is permitted when temperatures outside stay over 29 degrees celsius .
“ because of the long , persistent heat , for this summer , all department heads are to allow a day off in consideration of the extreme weather conditions , under the condition that staff allow for this in their flexi-time balance . ” germany has been sweltering under temperatures that have so far touched 39.2 degrees celsius – at mannheim airport on monday – with no respite in sight .
experts believe the record temperature set in gärmersdorf in 1983 may be in danger of being overtaken this year .
the whole of europe is wilting in the heat and nuclear reactors are being hosed down in a bid to avert a summer meltdown .
even so , some believe that this is no reason for germans to stop working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : get back to work !
the federal employment court in erfurt is one organization that says the germans should labor on .
a spokesperson for the bundesarbeitsgerichts -lrb- bag -rrb- told the german press association dpa on tuesday that heat in the workplace is no grounds for refusing to work but “ at especially high temperatures , the rate of work can be adjusted if necessary . ”
so , it appears that in the event of possible death by stewing or dehydration , working slowly is the acceptable alternative to taking a day off and living to toil another day . the german civil code disagrees .
clear regulations state the conditions under which germans should be expected to work .
according to the code , the employer is duty bound to protect employees “ against danger to life and health . ”
offices should be maintained at a “ beneficial room temperature ” and if possible be equipped with climate control or air-conditioning .
room temperatures should not exceed 26 degrees celsius . those employers that can not provide a safe and healthy environment for workers in extreme heat now have a choice : follow the lead of the governmental departments who believe that time taken off now can be made up in the future , which will lead to happier and more productive employees in the long run .

all except the germans who are conspicuously fewer in number . it is one of the hottest summers on record for many a year and for those holiday makers who booked their vacation months ago in the hope that 2003 would deliver weather worthy of their main break , it is a welcome , although intense , sunny period .
however , one group traditionally first to grab all the good spots on the pool side is conspicuously smaller in number this year .
while global tourism picks up from the slump caused by terrorist attacks , war and the deadly sars virus , the self-acclaimed champions of world travel are staying at home in increasing numbers .
this summer , there will be fewer germans on the beaches .
a report from british research group mintel sees a strong increase in global tourism in the next three years , with an expected 240 million people from the united states , britain and germany going abroad on holiday by 2005 .
germany will continue to provide the world with the greatest number of travelers in the coming years but by 2015 , britain is expected to leapfrog the united states into second place in the travel league table .
fewer germans traveling than last year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global instability has cut the numbers of people on the beach .
even so , the numbers of germans travelling abroad right now are significantly lower than previous years and estimates expect fewer germans to book a holiday trip – at home or abroad – in 2003 than in the record low 2002 .
it seems it is taking longer for the germans to dip their toes back into the waters of travel after global emergencies such as the war in iraq than other nationalities .
while tourists from the uk , france and elsewhere quickly resumed their travel habits after the end of the war , the usually intrepid and keen germans have stayed away from the travel agencies .
robin zimmermann , a spokesperson at tui , europe ’ s biggest tour operator , told the financial times : " this has been a uniquely german phenomenon .
elsewhere , iraq interrupted the usual travel patterns only temporarily .
in germany , bookings are only now beginning to recover . "
economy and unemployment factors global tourism figures are expected to almost double by 2005 from the low of 185 million travelers in 1999 and will keep growing steadily until at least 2015 , depending on world events , but germans are unlikely to contribute in great numbers while their home economy continues to struggle and the unemployment situation worsens .
" the jobless levels in particular have people worried , " said christian börgen of the drv travel industry association .
" not only are people reluctant to shell out money but many are probably also uncomfortable with the thought of turning their backs on their employers for three full weeks , for fear of not having a job to return to . "
tour operators suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are heading off at the last minute .
as a result , germans are taking shorter summer vacations and leaving the booking of their travel arrangements to the last minute in an attempt to get the cheapest rates available , much to the dismay of the big tour operators .
both tui and thomas cook have cut capacities and lowered prices for the coming winter by 11 percent to compete with last minute agencies which have seen an increase in summer bookings .
tui ’ s total tourism sales are down by 7.3 percent on those from last year with german sales down even more , a 10.8 percent drop in the market from the figures in 2002 .
however , figures suggest that although fewer germans are contemplating holidays this year , in terms of destinations favored by those who are venturing out of germany , there have been no big shifts .
spain and italy still popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain remains the number one destination for germans .
foreign destination number one for germans remains spain , with 13 percent of germans heading for the southern sun .
and even the recent spat between their country and italy hasn ’ t stopped 10 percent of all german travelers heading to silvio berlusconi ’ s homeland .

the original song " tour de france " from 1983 has now been expanded by a prolog and a new version , which is broken down into three " stages . "
the new album also includes seven new songs .
a part of musical history a lot has happened in the music world since kraftwerk brought out their last album .
but the course of contemporary music is inconceivable without their influence .
following the boom of folk music and the hippie movement in the 1960s , the world rediscovered rock music in the 1970s .
but four düsseldorf students calling themselves kraftwerk - which means " power station " in german - wanted to do something different .
they drew on the influence of experimental electronic forces such as composer karlheinz stockhausen to create minimalist music on synthesizers , drum machines and tape recorders .
live performances often included the band leaving the stage and look-a-like robots playing the songs .
their first single " autobahn " in 1974 marked kraftwerk 's breakthrough and established them as the representatives of hi-tech , computerized music .
kraftwerk 's influence can be found in techno , house and electro-pop .
they had an impact on an entire generation of english new-wave acts , such as the human league , gary numan , depeche mode and omd .
david bowie claimed to have long been an admirer of the group .
his track " v-2 schneider " on the album heroes is named after kraftwerk member florian schneider .
taking their time for many years , rumors circulated that kraftwerk was about to release a new album .
but the band , which is notorious for its aversion to public interviews and publicity hype , did n't make information available on the album 's due-date .
so what were kraftwerk 's core duo ralf hütter and florian schneider up to ?
the " musical workers , " as they call themselves , allegedly spent almost every day in their legendary klingklang studio in düsseldorf to work on new compositions .
yet the outside world hardly heard a sound , apart from the expo 2000 jingle and the related single .
critics received the song composed for the world fair in hanover somewhat reservedly and many claim it was solely written for the substantial -lrb- undisclosed -rrb- price tag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk : " tour de france soundtracks " the new album tour de france soundtracks is seeing a different track record .
it has stormed the german charts and is holding the number one spot .
considering that most of germany 's top hits are more rock-oriented , the success of kraftwerk 's classic electronic sound comes somewhat as a surprise .
yet the album has gotten mixed reviews .
many critics feel the band is offering nothing new .
of course , expectations were high after so many years of absence from the musical stage .
but , on the other hand , kraftwerk has no need to be something new .
they already did that - over 30 years ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links kraftwerk cryptic and not very wordy , kraftwerk 's official website captures their public image quite well .

the commissioner , who is championing plans for a new directive on sex discrimination , says insurers should not take account of pregnancy or longer life expectancy when setting premiums .
it is the first time anna diamantopoulou has spoken publicly about her plans to outlaw sex discrimination in the supply of all goods and services .
interviewed on thursday 's edition of bbc news 24 's business today programme , she says women are being punished when they buy insurance because of two biological differences .
higher premiums women pay more for health insurance because of the risks linked to pregnancy .
secondly women get lower incomes from their pension savings when they buy an annuity .
insurers say annuities for women are lower for a reason .
the same pot of pension money has to last longer - so it is spread more thinly over more years .
they say that while health insurance costs more for women at first , it is cheaper at later ages , when men are more likely to claim .
but their arguments have not satisfied the commissioner , who says biological differences should be ignored by insurers .
while women taking out annuities and health insurance may benefit from the law change , women could pay higher car insurance premiums as a result .
women often benefit from cheaper premiums , as they tend to cover fewer miles , and drive smaller cars .
in response mary francis director general of the association of british insurers told the bbc that there was good reason for insurers taking a persons gender into consideration .
" information about differences between the sexes , differences in life expectancy , differences indeed , in the fact that you might get pregnant if you 're a woman are relevant to setting insurance prices , " ms francis said .

" the management of licensed premises can have a significant impact upon the number of violent incidents in and around their premises in order to impact on the levels of violent crime in our town centres . "
joe curran , chair of blackpool licensees ' forum , said the policy will enable the development of a " sensible pricing structure " in the town , which the forum has been campaigning for since 2000 .
" the vast majority of licensees will welcome this agreement as they firmly believe it will have a major impact in the reduction of violent crime , disorder and anti-social behaviour , " he said .
' no speed-drinking ' peter clarke , owner of the heaven and hell nightclub , said : " i agree with a level playing field and totally agree that our premises should be judged on entertainment and not have to compete in a cheap drinks market . "
the conditions of the policy include : no " drink all you can drink for a fixed entry fee " promotions no discounting at all on friday or saturday evenings after 2000 bst no games involving speed-drinking no promotions such as £ 1 a pint in circumstances likely to lead to binge drinking occurring .

and one of his supporters says he will counter-sue for damages .
martin , 58 , of emneth hungate , norfolk , was freed from prison last week after serving two-thirds of a five-year sentence for manslaughter .
in august 1999 he shot dead burglar fred barras , 16 , and wounded the teenager 's accomplice brendan fearon , 33 , after confronting them at his isolated farmhouse late at night .
fearon is suing for loss of earnings and compensation for injuries he sustained when martin shot him .
a report in thursday 's edition of the sun newspaper says the amount fearon is claiming in damages has now been upped from £ 15,000 to £ 100,000 .
mr martin is going to counter-sue for the damages he suffered when burgled and there will be a big court case in london next year peter sainsbury martin supporter but peter sainsbury , who has campaigned for martin 's freedom , says the farmer will counter-sue fearon for the damages he suffered when being burgled and would also challenge fearon 's right to legal aid .
martin 's friends say they believe that fearon has money which he has not declared which could prevent him from claiming legal aid .
" we are going to challenge fearon 's right to legal aid and that process has already started , " said mr sainsbury .
" mr martin is going to counter-sue for the damages he suffered when burgled and there will be a big court case in london next year . "
burglar brendan fearon is suing over the injuries he suffered mr sainsbury said he was not surprised at reports of fearon increasing his claim for compensation , adding : " it comes as no surprise because he 's going to make every effort to maximise what he is going to get . "
the sun quotes " a close associate " as the source of its report .
neither fearon nor his lawyers were available for comment .
the legal battle between fearon and martin is due to take place at the high court in london next year .
martin has sold his story to the daily mirror newspaper for a reported £ 100,000 and has not been seen at his home since he was released from prison last week .

fearon is suing for loss of earnings and compensation for injuries he sustained when martin shot him .
a report in thursday 's edition of the sun newspaper says the amount fearon is claiming in damages has now been upped from £ 15,000 to £ 100,000 .
mr martin is going to counter-sue for the damages he suffered when burgled and there will be a big court case in london next year peter sainsbury martin supporter but peter sainsbury , who has campaigned for martin 's freedom , says the farmer will counter-sue fearon for the damages he suffered when being burgled and would also challenge fearon 's right to legal aid .
martin 's friends say they believe that fearon has money which he has not declared which could prevent him from claiming legal aid .
" we are going to challenge fearon 's right to legal aid and that process has already started , " said mr sainsbury .
" mr martin is going to counter-sue for the damages he suffered when burgled and there will be a big court case in london next year . "
burglar brendan fearon is suing over the injuries he suffered mr sainsbury said he was not surprised at reports of fearon increasing his claim for compensation , adding : " it comes as no surprise because he 's going to make every effort to maximise what he is going to get . "
the sun quotes " a close associate " as the source of its report .
neither fearon nor his lawyers were available for comment .
the legal battle between fearon and martin is due to take place at the high court in london next year .
martin has sold his story to the daily mirror newspaper for a reported £ 100,000 and has not been seen at his home since he was released from prison last week .
