as part of efforts to halt the spread of vcjd , the human form of bse , britain has sourced all plasma for blood products from the us since 1999 .
the conservatives are now calling on the food standards agency to make checks to ensure blood remains safe .
there is no proof yet that vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions .
but the potential danger was highlighted last week when it emerged a patient in a british hospital had died from vcjd after receiving blood from an infected donor .
tory health spokesman andrew lansley said britain could not halt imports of us blood products as it would almost certainly be impossible to find sufficient supplies from a safer source .
but he is calling for action to reassure the public of the safety of the us supplies .
bovine spongiform encephalopathy first surfaced mid-1980s can pass to humans through infected beef products human form of disease called vcjd vcjd has killed 137 people , mainly in the uk us searches for ' mad cow ' clues " there is an important issue that arises from this case , which is to try to maintain the integrity of the american food chain , so we can be sure that american blood products continue not to be at risk of contamination from bse , leading to vcjd , " mr lansley said .
" therefore , the two things i am looking for when parliament returns -lsb- on 5 january -rsb- are firstly , for us to hear from the fsa that they are working with the food and drug administration in america to ensure inspection and controls in america are as good as anywhere , and secondly , to hear from the health secretary -lsb- john reid -rsb- what additional questions he is asking to make sure american blood products are as safe as we can make them . "
several countries banned us beef imports hours after america announced its first suspected case of bse .
the move was led by japan , which bought $ 800m of us beef last year , and canada later followed with a partial ban .
countries that have banned us beef japan canada - partial ban south korea singapore taiwan malaysia thailand hong kong russia australia south africa brazil mexico ukraine china mexico , brazil , russia , ukraine , and a number of asian counties from singapore to south korea were among those who followed japan 's example .
early on thursday , china became the latest country to suspend beef products from the us .
the european union said it was keeping a close eye on the situation , but it has anyway banned most us beef for many years because of growth hormones in the meat .
tissue samples from the suspected cow are already being studied in the uk , which suffered a devastating outbreak of bse in the mid-1990s .
the results will be known in a few days ' time .
so far , 143 cases of vcjd have been diagnosed in the uk , although the numbers of new cases are falling .
there is no established treatment for the illness , which causes massive brain damage and normally kills within months of being detected .

as part of efforts to halt the spread of vcjd , the human form of bse , britain has sourced all plasma for blood products from the us since 1999 .
the conservatives are now calling on the food standards agency to make checks to ensure blood remains safe .
there is no proof yet that vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions .
but the potential danger was highlighted last week when it emerged a patient in a british hospital had died from vcjd after receiving blood from an infected donor .
tory health spokesman andrew lansley said britain could not halt imports of us blood products as it would almost certainly be impossible to find sufficient supplies from a safer source .
but he is calling for action to reassure the public of the safety of the us supplies .
bovine spongiform encephalopathy first surfaced mid-1980s can pass to humans through infected beef products human form of disease called vcjd vcjd has killed 137 people , mainly in the uk us searches for ' mad cow ' clues " there is an important issue that arises from this case , which is to try to maintain the integrity of the american food chain , so we can be sure that american blood products continue not to be at risk of contamination from bse , leading to vcjd , " mr lansley said .
" therefore , the two things i am looking for when parliament returns -lsb- on 5 january -rsb- are firstly , for us to hear from the fsa that they are working with the food and drug administration in america to ensure inspection and controls in america are as good as anywhere , and secondly , to hear from the health secretary -lsb- john reid -rsb- what additional questions he is asking to make sure american blood products are as safe as we can make them . "
several countries banned us beef imports hours after america announced its first suspected case of bse .
the move was led by japan , which bought $ 800m of us beef last year , and canada later followed with a partial ban .
countries that have banned us beef japan canada - partial ban south korea singapore taiwan malaysia thailand hong kong russia australia south africa brazil mexico ukraine china mexico , brazil , russia , ukraine , and a number of asian counties from singapore to south korea were among those who followed japan 's example .
early on thursday , china became the latest country to suspend beef products from the us .
the european union said it was keeping a close eye on the situation , but it has anyway banned most us beef for many years because of growth hormones in the meat .
tissue samples from the suspected cow are already being studied in the uk , which suffered a devastating outbreak of bse in the mid-1990s .
the results will be known in a few days ' time .
so far , 143 cases of vcjd have been diagnosed in the uk , although the numbers of new cases are falling .
there is no established treatment for the illness , which causes massive brain damage and normally kills within months of being detected .

the party is using the 79th birthday of prime minister atal behari vajpayee to look ahead , and hundreds of supporters have gathered outside his residence .
the hindu nationalist bjp recently swept to victory in three out of four state elections by heavily defeating the main opposition congress party .
the vote was its last big test ahead of general elections due by next october .
some observers believe the bjp could be tempted to bring the general election forward , although mr vajpayee has said the polls will be held on schedule .

deputy prime minister lk advani and party president venkaiah naidu are among those slated to take part .
celebrating victory in the recent polls , bjp won big victories in the states of rajasthan , madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh , but lost the capital , delhi , to the congress .
the bjp rose to prominence in india espousing strongly pro-hindu policies .
but observers say it downplayed its hindu nationalism during these elections and that issues such as good governance and development strongly influenced the voters .
the party will deliberate the pros and cons of advancing the general election .
although the state polls witnessed a straight fight between the bjp and the congress , correspondents say next year 's national polls will be very different , given the presence of many regional players .
the bjp is also in disarray in india 's largest state , uttar pradesh , which plays a big role in determining who controls government at the national level .

some observers believe the bjp could be tempted to bring the general election forward , although mr vajpayee has said the polls will be held on schedule .
taking stock " he is the leader of the bjp and will be the country 's next prime minister , " declared party official mukhtar abbas naqvi .
later in the day , party officials are due to discuss its " mission 2004 " - its strategy for the forthcoming general elections .
deputy prime minister lk advani and party president venkaiah naidu are among those slated to take part .
celebrating victory in the recent polls , bjp won big victories in the states of rajasthan , madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh , but lost the capital , delhi , to the congress .
the bjp rose to prominence in india espousing strongly pro-hindu policies .
but observers say it downplayed its hindu nationalism during these elections and that issues such as good governance and development strongly influenced the voters .
the party will deliberate the pros and cons of advancing the general election .
although the state polls witnessed a straight fight between the bjp and the congress , correspondents say next year 's national polls will be very different , given the presence of many regional players .
the bjp is also in disarray in india 's largest state , uttar pradesh , which plays a big role in determining who controls government at the national level .

the farm near yakima , washington , where the cow was found , has been quarantined .
mr dehaven said that because bse was usually transmitted through contaminated feed and had an incubation period of up to five years , it was " important to focus on the feed where she was born " .
tests tissue samples from the suspected cow are already being studied in the uk , which suffered a devastating outbreak of bse in the mid-1990s .
the results will be known in a few days ' time .
details of the case were revealed by us agriculture secretary ann veneman , who said a holstein cow had tested positive on 9 december - but she insisted the country 's beef was safe .

in his christmas sermon dr rowan williams criticised france over plans to ban muslim headscarves in schools .
he said the same suspicion of religion existed in the uk , where tony blair 's beliefs were greeted with " sniggers " .
dr williams said part of the reason lay in the misuse of faith for oppression and violence , as an alibi for atrocity .
the archbishop called on christians to show their faith was " on the side of humanity " .
he said : " discomfort about religion or about a particular religion may be the response of an educated liberal or , at the opposite extreme , the unthinking violence of an anti-semite ; it is n't easy to face the fact that sometimes the effects are similar for the believer . "
christians , muslims , jews and others -lsb- should -rsb- stand with each other and speak out for each other in times of stress or harassment dr rowan williams the archbishop said religious faith had too often become the " language of the powerful " .
he said : " historically , the answer is , alas , that religious faith has too often been the language of the powerful , the excuse for oppression , the alibi for atrocity .
" it has appeared as itself intolerant of difference -lrb- hence the legacy of anti-semitism -rrb- , as a campaigning , aggressive force for uniformity , as a self-defensive and often corrupt set of institutions indifferent to basic human welfare . "
dr williams criticised those who carried out acts of terror in the name of religion , and called for multi-faith unity .

the men had expected to learn their fate at egypt 's emergency high state security court on thursday .
the trio claim they signed false confessions after being tortured .
maajid nawaz , from essex , and londoners ian nisbet and reza pankhurst , are accused of trying to revive an islamic group .
the britons , along with 23 egyptians , are accused of trying to revive islamic liberation party , hizb-ut-tahrir .
the britons , who are all married with children , were seized in a post 11 september crackdown and accused of promoting aims including the overthrow of the egyptian government . "
it is yet another form of pressure , of abuse and of punishment for a group of innocent people who are not guilty of any crime . "
hodan pankhurst the prosecution says hizb-ut-tahrir was banned in 1974 following an attempted coup , while the group argues it was never banned in law .
on thursday the judge adjourned the case until 25 march .
mr pankhurst 's wife , hodan , said of the delay : " it is yet another form of pressure , of abuse and of punishment for a group of innocent people who are not guilty of any crime .
' where is the justice ? '
" we would have been waiting for this verdict for eight months by march unnecessarily so where is the justice ? "
mr nawaz 's wife rabia , said : " we have tried all avenues of action to bring this injustice to an end and i think this further delay is proof , if anyone needs it , that the egyptian judicial process is not there to secure justice but to legitimise the tyranny and corruption of the egyptian government .
" this whole process of delay is punishment in itself . "
the britons claim they were forced to sign confessions which they could not read in october of last year .
their families have demanded the cases against them are thrown out of court .

it was recorded at an army barracks in windsor - the first time the address had been shot entirely on location .
this is the full text of the speech . "
i 'm sure that most of you will be celebrating christmas at home in the company of your families and friends .
but i know that some of you will not be so lucky .
this year , i 'm speaking to you from the household cavalry barracks in windsor , because i want to draw attention to the many servicemen and women who are stationed far from home this christmas .
i 'm thinking about their wives and children and about their parents and friends .
separation at this time is especially hard to bear .
' lasting peace ' it is not just a matter of separation , the men and women of the services continue to face serious risks and dangers as they carry out their duties .
they have done this brilliantly .
i think we all have very good reasons for feeling proud of their achievements , both in war and as they help to build a lasting peace in trouble spots across the globe . "
i know that all our thoughts at this time are with the families who are suffering the pain of bereavement " none of this can be achieved without paying a price .
i know that all our thoughts at this time are with the families who are suffering the pain of bereavement .
all those who have recently lost a close relative or friend will know how difficult christmas can be .
' disciplined teams ' these individual servicemen and women are our neighbours and come from our own towns and villages ; from every part of the country and from every background .
the process of training within the navy , the army and air force has moulded them together into disciplined teams .
they have learnt to take responsibility and to exercise judgement and restraint in situations of acute stress and danger .
they have brought great credit to themselves and to our country as a whole .
' steadfast loyalty ' i had an opportunity recently at the barracks to meet some of those who played their part with such distinction in the iraq operations . "
there are groups of people who are giving their time generously to make a difference to the lives of others " i was left with a deep sense of respect and admiration for their steadfast loyalty to each other and to our nation .
i believe there is a lesson for us all here .
it is that each of us can achieve much more if we work together as members of a team .
the founder of the christian faith himself chose twelve disciples to help him in his ministry .
' singled out ' i was reminded of the importance of teamwork as i presented , for the first time last summer , the queen 's awards for voluntary service by groups within the community .
i have been struck by how often people say to me that they are receiving their reward on behalf of a team and that they do not deserve to be singled out .
this annual award recognises the team rather than the individual .
in this country and throughout the commonwealth there are groups of people who are giving their time generously to make a difference to the lives of others .
as we think of them and of our servicemen and women far from home at this christmas time , i hope we all , whatever our faith , can draw inspiration from the words of the familiar prayer : " teach us good lord to serve thee as thou deservest : to give and not to count the cost ; to fight and not to heed the wounds ; to toil and not to seek for rest ; to labour and not to ask for any reward , save that of knowing that we do thy will . "
it is this knowledge which will help us all to enjoy the festival of christmas .
a happy christmas to you all . "

it was recorded at an army barracks in windsor - the first time the address had been shot entirely on location .
this is the full text of the speech .
i 'm sure that most of you will be celebrating christmas at home in the company of your families and friends .
this year 's christmas speech was the first delivered on location but i know that some of you will not be so lucky .
this year , i 'm speaking to you from the household cavalry barracks in windsor , because i want to draw attention to the many servicemen and women who are stationed far from home this christmas .
i 'm thinking about their wives and children and about their parents and friends .
separation at this time is especially hard to bear .
' lasting peace ' it is not just a matter of separation , the men and women of the services continue to face serious risks and dangers as they carry out their duties .
they have done this brilliantly .
i think we all have very good reasons for feeling proud of their achievements , both in war and as they help to build a lasting peace in trouble spots across the globe .
i know that all our thoughts at this time are with the families who are suffering the pain of bereavement none of this can be achieved without paying a price .
i know that all our thoughts at this time are with the families who are suffering the pain of bereavement .
all those who have recently lost a close relative or friend will know how difficult christmas can be .
' disciplined teams ' these individual servicemen and women are our neighbours and come from our own towns and villages ; from every part of the country and from every background .
the process of training within the navy , the army and air force has moulded them together into disciplined teams .
they have learnt to take responsibility and to exercise judgement and restraint in situations of acute stress and danger .
they have brought great credit to themselves and to our country as a whole .
' steadfast loyalty ' i had an opportunity recently at the barracks to meet some of those who played their part with such distinction in the iraq operations .
there are groups of people who are giving their time generously to make a difference to the lives of others i was left with a deep sense of respect and admiration for their steadfast loyalty to each other and to our nation .
i believe there is a lesson for us all here .
it is that each of us can achieve much more if we work together as members of a team .
the founder of the christian faith himself chose twelve disciples to help him in his ministry .
' singled out ' i was reminded of the importance of teamwork as i presented , for the first time last summer , the queen 's awards for voluntary service by groups within the community .

it was recorded at an army barracks in windsor - the first time the address had been shot entirely on location .
this is the full text of the speech .
i 'm sure that most of you will be celebrating christmas at home in the company of your families and friends .
this year 's christmas speech was the first delivered on location but i know that some of you will not be so lucky .
this year , i 'm speaking to you from the household cavalry barracks in windsor , because i want to draw attention to the many servicemen and women who are stationed far from home this christmas .
i 'm thinking about their wives and children and about their parents and friends .
separation at this time is especially hard to bear .
' lasting peace ' it is not just a matter of separation , the men and women of the services continue to face serious risks and dangers as they carry out their duties .
they have done this brilliantly .
i think we all have very good reasons for feeling proud of their achievements , both in war and as they help to build a lasting peace in trouble spots across the globe .
i know that all our thoughts at this time are with the families who are suffering the pain of bereavement none of this can be achieved without paying a price .
i know that all our thoughts at this time are with the families who are suffering the pain of bereavement .
all those who have recently lost a close relative or friend will know how difficult christmas can be .
' disciplined teams ' these individual servicemen and women are our neighbours and come from our own towns and villages ; from every part of the country and from every background .
the process of training within the navy , the army and air force has moulded them together into disciplined teams .
they have learnt to take responsibility and to exercise judgement and restraint in situations of acute stress and danger .
they have brought great credit to themselves and to our country as a whole .
' steadfast loyalty ' i had an opportunity recently at the barracks to meet some of those who played their part with such distinction in the iraq operations .
there are groups of people who are giving their time generously to make a difference to the lives of others i was left with a deep sense of respect and admiration for their steadfast loyalty to each other and to our nation .
i believe there is a lesson for us all here .
it is that each of us can achieve much more if we work together as members of a team .
the founder of the christian faith himself chose twelve disciples to help him in his ministry .
' singled out ' i was reminded of the importance of teamwork as i presented , for the first time last summer , the queen 's awards for voluntary service by groups within the community .
i have been struck by how often people say to me that they are receiving their reward on behalf of a team and that they do not deserve to be singled out .
this annual award recognises the team rather than the individual .
in this country and throughout the commonwealth there are groups of people who are giving their time generously to make a difference to the lives of others .
as we think of them and of our servicemen and women far from home at this christmas time , i hope we all , whatever our faith , can draw inspiration from the words of the familiar prayer : " teach us good lord to serve thee as thou deservest : to give and not to count the cost ; to fight and not to heed the wounds ; to toil and not to seek for rest ; to labour and not to ask for any reward , save that of knowing that we do thy will . "
it is this knowledge which will help us all to enjoy the festival of christmas .
a happy christmas to you all .

at least 191 people died after inhaling toxic fumes following an explosion at the field in chongqing municipality .
hundreds of others flooded into local hospitals suffering from poisoning and chemical burns .
government officials have arrived at the scene to investigate the disaster and engineers are working to try to seal the blown-out well .
natural gas and sulphurated hydrogen were released by the blast rescue workers are searching surrounding villages for more victims .
president hu jintao has ordered local authorities to do everything possible to speed up the rescue and prevent the poisonous gases from spreading .
ninety-five thousand people have died in work-related accidents in china in the first nine months of this year .
' patients everywhere ' most of the victims died immediately after a well at the field burst and released a cloud of poisonous gases .
a nearby hospital was overwhelmed as it tried to deal with victims of the blast .
go all out to rescue victims , prevent poisonous gas from spreading further and reduce casualties president hu jintao in pictures : gas blast " we are very busy .
there are patients everywhere , " one unnamed hospital worker told the reuters news agency .
almost 300 people , mostly children , were reported to be receiving treatment in hospital , and 10 times that number are thought to have suffered minor symptoms .
the injured were reported to have swollen and sensitive eyes , and some found it difficult to stand , local media reported .
by the end of the day , 41,000 people had been evacuated from within a radius of five kilometres -lrb- three miles -rrb- of the field .
operations were going normally before the gas suddenly exploded from the side of the drill , qian zhijia , deputy head of the gas field , told xinhua news agency .
the accident sent a high concentration of natural gas and sulphurated hydrogen shooting 30 metres -lrb- 100 feet -rrb- out of a burst well .
mr qian says the situation should be under control by friday .
china is notorious for its dangerous working conditions .
cabinet response beijing has sent a team led by a cabinet secretary to the scene , xinhua reported .
it said president hu and other chinese leaders had called on local authorities to " go all out to rescue victims , prevent poisonous gas from spreading further and reduce casualties " .
they urged local officials to accommodate the thousands evacuated .
the natural gas industry is an emblem of modernisation in a country heavily dependent on coal , our correspondent says .
the field belongs to the china national petroleum corporation .
a company spokesman said 13 special rescue vehicles were en route to the scene and that mud would be pumped into the hole to stop the spread of toxic sulphurated hydrogen .
fires have been lit to try to burn off leaking gas , afp news agency reported .
cnpc 's subsidiary petrochina began construction of a $ 400m gas pipeline from chongqing to central china in august .

francis wacziarg is an author and historian .
originally from france , he has lived in india for 33 years .
even though i 'm originally from france , i made india my home .
i acquired indian citizenship after 20 years of living in india , and i find that india has been my country from the word go .
i think the west is old now , while i feel that india is a virgin land before i came , i spent most of my childhood not in france but in other countries , so i had already travelled around quite a bit .
but when i came to india , that was it - this was where i wanted to live .
my decision was only in favour of india - not giving up france .
as it is , i go back to france a few times every year , on work or to see my family .
but i really feel that home is here .
i wrote two books on india , on rajasthan .
in the course of my research on the two books , i came across some very old forts that were in ruins .
my business partner and i had the idea of picking up one of them , restoring it to its original splendour , and converting it into a hotel .
so it went from one first experience to a passion .
i do n't considerer it as a business simply , but more as something that we have to do for society - and for the country .
as far as france is concerned , i consider it a great wealth to be able to have the culture of france .
like india , i think france is backed by centuries of culture .
so i think it 's a great opportunity to sit on the fence in a way , and enjoy both cultures .
i would call myself a franco-indian or an indian-frenchman .
you can never change your culture - you can change your citizenship but you can not change your culture .
i feel richer for that - i have my roots in french culture and i have been able to open up to indian culture .
i do n't think i would like to live in france , because there is in india a sense of achievement which is lost in the west .
i think the west is old now .
i feel that india is a virgin land .
there 's so much that one wants to do in this country .
there are so many things that i would n't have been able to do had i lived in any other country .
india has its particularities in the sense that there are still things that exist from the middle ages and are still contemporary , and can still be achieved here .
that does n't exist in many countries in the world .
my indian friends - and i practically have only indian friends , as i live here permanently - i think they like me for not aping india , but being at home in india .
i do n't wear indian clothes , and people say " we like you for that , " because traditional dress is not fancy dress - and a foreigner wearing indian clothes would tend to consider it fancy dress .
it 's a lack of respect for a culture when you 're not intrinsically part of it , when you ape it to that extent .
so one of the things that people have been consistently telling me is that " we like you for what you are - and yet being so close to us " .

the jodrell bank telescope in cheshire scanned mars for two hours late on thursday , but no signal was picked up indicating the lander was alive .
scientists remain optimistic despite the silence and further efforts will be made to contact beagle on friday .
the big fear is the probe could have crashed into the martian surface .
" jodrell bank listened out for beagle 2 tonight , but did not detect a transmission , " said team spokesman peter barratt .
expected message nasa 's mars odyssey craft will pass over the landing zone at 1815 gmt on boxing day .
why might beagle not call ?
a computer glitch has delayed the transmission perhaps the probe has a misaligned antenna there was some catastrophic failure during landing beagle made it down but fell into a crevasse the us space agency orbiter has already tried once to hear a transmission from beagle - and failed .
researchers must hope it has better luck on the second fly-over .
the beagle 2 lander was supposed to have dived into the martian atmosphere at 0245 gmt on christmas day and reached the surface about seven minutes later ; its impact softened by parachutes and gas-filled bags .
the scientific team are expecting a pre-planned signal from the disc-shaped robotic probe , informing earth it survived the fiery entry .
a picture of itself and the surrounding terrain should also be among the early data returns .
european success even if mars odyssey fails on friday to capture and relay the beagle transmission , the search for the british lander will go on .
both jodrell and odyssey will have other opportunities in the coming days to sweep the martian surface for signs of the 70-kg robotic probe .
cost of beagle 2 total cost : between £ 35m and £ 40m numerous private companies have invested in the project underwritten by european space agency and uk 's department of trade and industry in addition , the beagle team have been offered the services of another large radio telescope at stanford in california to assist the search .
and mars express -lrb- beagle 's mothership -rrb- should also be in position soon to try to make contact with its " baby " .
the success of mars express in obtaining an orbit around the red planet has certainly cheered european scientists as they endure the agony of waiting for word on beagle .
controllers at the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- operations centre at darmstadt , germany , clapped and hugged each other when a big screen showed blips indicating they had regained the orbiter 's data feed after it emerged from behind mars following its first circle .
powerful camera " at least the initial checks show that the spacecraft is in very good condition , " said flight director michael mckay .
the orbit of mars express must now be refined so it can take up its science mission - and make contact with beagle if it truly is operational on the surface .
" the arrival of mars express is a great success for europe and for the international science community .
now , we are just waiting for a signal from beagle 2 to make this christmas the best we could hope for , " said david southwood , head of esa 's science directorate .
mars express is the major part of the european mission - beagle was a late add-on - and will search for water , ice and key chemicals buried under the martian surface .

the jodrell bank telescope in cheshire scanned mars for two hours late on thursday , but no signal was picked up indicating the lander was alive .
scientists remain optimistic despite the silence and further efforts will be made to contact beagle on friday .
the big fear is the probe could have crashed into the martian surface .
" jodrell bank listened out for beagle 2 tonight , but did not detect a transmission , " said team spokesman peter barratt .
expected message nasa 's mars odyssey craft will pass over the landing zone at 1815 gmt on boxing day .
why might beagle not call ?
a computer glitch has delayed the transmission perhaps the probe has a misaligned antenna there was some catastrophic failure during landing beagle made it down but fell into a crevasse the us space agency orbiter has already tried once to hear a transmission from beagle - and failed .
researchers must hope it has better luck on the second fly-over .
the beagle 2 lander was supposed to have dived into the martian atmosphere at 0245 gmt on christmas day and reached the surface about seven minutes later ; its impact softened by parachutes and gas-filled bags .
the scientific team are expecting a pre-planned signal from the disc-shaped robotic probe , informing earth it survived the fiery entry .
a picture of itself and the surrounding terrain should also be among the early data returns .
european success even if mars odyssey fails on friday to capture and relay the beagle transmission , the search for the british lander will go on .
both jodrell and odyssey will have other opportunities in the coming days to sweep the martian surface for signs of the 70-kg robotic probe .
cost of beagle 2 total cost : between £ 35m and £ 40m numerous private companies have invested in the project underwritten by european space agency and uk 's department of trade and industry in addition , the beagle team have been offered the services of another large radio telescope at stanford in california to assist the search .
and mars express -lrb- beagle 's mothership -rrb- should also be in position soon to try to make contact with its " baby " .
the success of mars express in obtaining an orbit around the red planet has certainly cheered european scientists as they endure the agony of waiting for word on beagle .
controllers at the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- operations centre at darmstadt , germany , clapped and hugged each other when a big screen showed blips indicating they had regained the orbiter 's data feed after it emerged from behind mars following its first circle .
powerful camera " at least the initial checks show that the spacecraft is in very good condition , " said flight director michael mckay .
the orbit of mars express must now be refined so it can take up its science mission - and make contact with beagle if it truly is operational on the surface .
" the arrival of mars express is a great success for europe and for the international science community .
now , we are just waiting for a signal from beagle 2 to make this christmas the best we could hope for , " said david southwood , head of esa 's science directorate .
mars express is the major part of the european mission - beagle was a late add-on - and will search for water , ice and key chemicals buried under the martian surface .
