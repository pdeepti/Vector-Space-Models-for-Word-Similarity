germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .
that only became possible after carl gustav became king in 1973 , however , as swedish crown princes lose their claim to the throne if they marry a commoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three decades after meeting at the munich olympic games , carl gustav and silvia attended the 2002 winter games in utah .
the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .
“ we must fight against the extreme material , social and emotional poverty in which they live . ”
during the first four years of its existence , the foundation provided aid to more than 125,000 children in brazil alone . dreaming of art history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal family celebrated silvia 's birthday with an outing at the opera on monday .

" it was a wonderful gathering , " said gunilla von arbin , the world childhood foundation 's secretary general . she added that the establishement of an internet resource guide for swedish children in need called " red pages " was announced at the meeting .
" it 's a new social initiative that has been developed for her majesty , " von arbin told dw-world . before tuesday 's official birthday celebrations , the queen and her family departed to northern sweden for a couple of days , where her children had booked her into a hotel made out of ice , according to news reports . she readily admits that it is not always easy being queen and recently told a swedish news agency about her secret dream of starting something completely new .
“ what i ’ d really like to do is study art history ” like her youngest daughter , silvia said .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .

opposition members have accused the government of rushing the case to trial before the election despite the fact that a majority of suspects is still on the run .
serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .
while the prosecutor has identified jovanovic as the only shooter , one of djindjic ’ s bodyguards has said the bullets came from different directions . even serbian interior minister dusan mihajlovic has expressed doubts that the details of the assassination will become clear without the arrest of the group ’ s alleged mastermind , milorad “ legija ” lukovic , a former chief of the so-called red berets paramilitary unit . criminals had links to government lukovic is the alleged head of the so-called “ zemun clan , ” a mafia-like organization that flourished during serbia 's international isolation through its links to the government of former serbian president slobodan milosevic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped to overthrow milosevic in 2000 and outraged nationalists by sending him to the war crimes court in the hague , apparently planned a crackdown on crime gangs like the zemun clan before he was murdered . nationalists ahead in polls the trial opened just days before sunday ’ s general elections in serbia .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .
they face up to 40 years each in jail if convicted .
the rest will be tried in absentia .
among other crimes , the suspects are charged with murder , terrorism and organized crime . a rushed trial ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defendant mladjan micic , center , sits with jail security officers in a bullet-proof box in the court room on tuesday .
opposition members have accused the government of rushing the case to trial before the election despite the fact that a majority of suspects is still on the run .
serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .
while the prosecutor has identified jovanovic as the only shooter , one of djindjic ’ s bodyguards has said the bullets came from different directions . even serbian interior minister dusan mihajlovic has expressed doubts that the details of the assassination will become clear without the arrest of the group ’ s alleged mastermind , milorad “ legija ” lukovic , a former chief of the so-called red berets paramilitary unit . criminals had links to government lukovic is the alleged head of the so-called “ zemun clan , ” a mafia-like organization that flourished during serbia 's international isolation through its links to the government of former serbian president slobodan milosevic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped to overthrow milosevic in 2000 and outraged nationalists by sending him to the war crimes court in the hague , apparently planned a crackdown on crime gangs like the zemun clan before he was murdered . nationalists ahead in polls the trial opened just days before sunday ’ s general elections in serbia .
three years ago , a coalition of parties , including djindjic ’ s democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , managed to win two-thirds of the votes . however , that coalition broke apart a few weeks ago and former political allies now accuse each other of corruption , abuse of office and connections to organized crime .
djindjic ’ s course of western-style economic and political reforms has been put on hold . recent polls suggest that as a result of this , nationalist parties could emerge as the leading vote-getters this time : milosevic ’ s socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- and the right-extremist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- .

the world ’ s largest passenger ship , the queen mary 2 , headed out to sea from its french shipping yard into a rosy future as luxury cruises enjoy a boom . almost everything on the queen mary 2 can be best described in superlatives .
it is the biggest , most luxurious and most expensive cruise ship that was ever built . at 74 meters high -lrb- 243 feet -rrb- , it is taller than the towers of the spires of the cathedral of notre dame in paris .
and at 345 meters , it is nearly as long as the empire state building is tall .
built in saint-nazaire , a fishing town-turned-shipbuilding center on the atlantic coast of france , the massive ship cost € 667 million -lrb- $ 826 million -rrb- and has room for some 2,600 passengers and a crew of 1,300 .
as the ship was pulled out to sea by tugboats , tens of thousands of people waved farewell from the shore .
a british maritime flag flew from its deck for the first time , following a handing-over ceremony during which its owner , cunard lines , officially took possession of its new flagship . cunard is a british subsidiary of the u.s. group carnival corporation . tragedy throws a pall over farewell initial plans had called for a more exuberant send-off , but that was toned down after an accident on november 15 left 15 people dead - many of them relatives of the workers who built the ship .
they fell to their deaths during a guided tour when a gangway leading to the ship from the quay collapsed . on tuesday , several planned firework displays and other festivities were cancelled because of the tragedy . many inhabitants of saint-nazaire lit candles instead .
" the cruise liner is leaving , but we will stay here with our nightmares , " one of the accident 's survivors , jacques guyader told reuters . astronomical costs after a brief journey to spain , to get the crew used to navigating its 150,000 tons , the qm2 will head to its home port of southampton , england , where britain 's queen elizabeth ii will formally name it in a ceremony on january 8 . it will then leave on its maiden voyage , to florida in the united states .
the cost for that trip also fits into the “ superlative ” category , with cabins running from € 1,300 to more than € 30,000 .
for their money , passengers gain access to the ship ’ s many amenities .
these include : five swimming pools , a thalasso-therapy center , a planetarium , a casino , several bars and restaurants , a ballroom , a 1,000 seat theatre , a virtual reality golf drive , and an art gallery with 200 works of art valued at 4 million euros .
there ’ s even a kennel for pampered pets .
cruises enjoy a boom there are apparently enough well heeled clients who can afford such luxuries ; the first two qm2 cruises are already fully booked .
and it ’ s not just the new shimmering ocean liner that ’ s in demand .
in general , ocean cruises are enjoying an unexpected boom .
the lucrative cruise market is currently dominated by cunard lines and its rival royal carribean , whose gigantic liners can carry up to 4,000 passengers .
despite the general travel slump in the wake of the iraq war and the sars epidemic , both shipping companies have registered hefty profits for 2003 .
prospects look good for the coming year too , with stocks of both cruise companies on wall street shooting to a record year ’ s high last week .
the two companies also expect growth potential in germany .
about 400,000 tourists or 0.5 percent of the german population booked a cruise this year , compared to 1.2 percent in britain and over 2 percent in the u.s. both cunard lines and royal carribean are hoping for a rise in demand in germany with an additional 800,000 passengers signing up for a luxury cruise . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

and at 345 meters , it is nearly as long as the empire state building is tall .
built in saint-nazaire , a fishing town-turned-shipbuilding center on the atlantic coast of france , the massive ship cost € 667 million -lrb- $ 826 million -rrb- and has room for some 2,600 passengers and a crew of 1,300 .
as the ship was pulled out to sea by tugboats , tens of thousands of people waved farewell from the shore .
a british maritime flag flew from its deck for the first time , following a handing-over ceremony during which its owner , cunard lines , officially took possession of its new flagship . cunard is a british subsidiary of the u.s. group carnival corporation . tragedy throws a pall over farewell initial plans had called for a more exuberant send-off , but that was toned down after an accident on november 15 left 15 people dead - many of them relatives of the workers who built the ship .
they fell to their deaths during a guided tour when a gangway leading to the ship from the quay collapsed . on tuesday , several planned firework displays and other festivities were cancelled because of the tragedy . many inhabitants of saint-nazaire lit candles instead .
" the cruise liner is leaving , but we will stay here with our nightmares , " one of the accident 's survivors , jacques guyader told reuters . astronomical costs after a brief journey to spain , to get the crew used to navigating its 150,000 tons , the qm2 will head to its home port of southampton , england , where britain 's queen elizabeth ii will formally name it in a ceremony on january 8 . it will then leave on its maiden voyage , to florida in the united states .
the cost for that trip also fits into the “ superlative ” category , with cabins running from € 1,300 to more than € 30,000 .
for their money , passengers gain access to the ship ’ s many amenities .
these include : five swimming pools , a thalasso-therapy center , a planetarium , a casino , several bars and restaurants , a ballroom , a 1,000 seat theatre , a virtual reality golf drive , and an art gallery with 200 works of art valued at 4 million euros .
there ’ s even a kennel for pampered pets .
cruises enjoy a boom there are apparently enough well heeled clients who can afford such luxuries ; the first two qm2 cruises are already fully booked .
and it ’ s not just the new shimmering ocean liner that ’ s in demand .
in general , ocean cruises are enjoying an unexpected boom .
the lucrative cruise market is currently dominated by cunard lines and its rival royal carribean , whose gigantic liners can carry up to 4,000 passengers .
despite the general travel slump in the wake of the iraq war and the sars epidemic , both shipping companies have registered hefty profits for 2003 .
prospects look good for the coming year too , with stocks of both cruise companies on wall street shooting to a record year ’ s high last week .
the two companies also expect growth potential in germany .
about 400,000 tourists or 0.5 percent of the german population booked a cruise this year , compared to 1.2 percent in britain and over 2 percent in the u.s. both cunard lines and royal carribean are hoping for a rise in demand in germany with an additional 800,000 passengers signing up for a luxury cruise . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the world ’ s largest passenger ship , the queen mary 2 , headed out to sea from its french shipping yard into a rosy future as luxury cruises enjoy a boom . almost everything on the queen mary 2 can be best described in superlatives .
it is the biggest , most luxurious and most expensive cruise ship that was ever built . at 74 meters high -lrb- 243 feet -rrb- , it is taller than the towers of the spires of the cathedral of notre dame in paris .
and at 345 meters , it is nearly as long as the empire state building is tall .
built in saint-nazaire , a fishing town-turned-shipbuilding center on the atlantic coast of france , the massive ship cost € 667 million -lrb- $ 826 million -rrb- and has room for some 2,600 passengers and a crew of 1,300 .
as the ship was pulled out to sea by tugboats , tens of thousands of people waved farewell from the shore .
a british maritime flag flew from its deck for the first time , following a handing-over ceremony during which its owner , cunard lines , officially took possession of its new flagship . cunard is a british subsidiary of the u.s. group carnival corporation . tragedy throws a pall over farewell initial plans had called for a more exuberant send-off , but that was toned down after an accident on november 15 left 15 people dead - many of them relatives of the workers who built the ship .
they fell to their deaths during a guided tour when a gangway leading to the ship from the quay collapsed . on tuesday , several planned firework displays and other festivities were cancelled because of the tragedy . many inhabitants of saint-nazaire lit candles instead .
" the cruise liner is leaving , but we will stay here with our nightmares , " one of the accident 's survivors , jacques guyader told reuters . astronomical costs after a brief journey to spain , to get the crew used to navigating its 150,000 tons , the qm2 will head to its home port of southampton , england , where britain 's queen elizabeth ii will formally name it in a ceremony on january 8 . it will then leave on its maiden voyage , to florida in the united states .
the cost for that trip also fits into the “ superlative ” category , with cabins running from € 1,300 to more than € 30,000 .
for their money , passengers gain access to the ship ’ s many amenities .
these include : five swimming pools , a thalasso-therapy center , a planetarium , a casino , several bars and restaurants , a ballroom , a 1,000 seat theatre , a virtual reality golf drive , and an art gallery with 200 works of art valued at 4 million euros .
there ’ s even a kennel for pampered pets .
cruises enjoy a boom there are apparently enough well heeled clients who can afford such luxuries ; the first two qm2 cruises are already fully booked .
and it ’ s not just the new shimmering ocean liner that ’ s in demand .
in general , ocean cruises are enjoying an unexpected boom .
the lucrative cruise market is currently dominated by cunard lines and its rival royal carribean , whose gigantic liners can carry up to 4,000 passengers .
despite the general travel slump in the wake of the iraq war and the sars epidemic , both shipping companies have registered hefty profits for 2003 .
prospects look good for the coming year too , with stocks of both cruise companies on wall street shooting to a record year ’ s high last week .
the two companies also expect growth potential in germany .
about 400,000 tourists or 0.5 percent of the german population booked a cruise this year , compared to 1.2 percent in britain and over 2 percent in the u.s. both cunard lines and royal carribean are hoping for a rise in demand in germany with an additional 800,000 passengers signing up for a luxury cruise . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .
that only became possible after carl gustav became king in 1973 , however , as swedish crown princes lose their claim to the throne if they marry a commoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three decades after meeting at the munich olympic games , carl gustav and silvia attended the 2002 winter games in utah .
the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .
“ we must fight against the extreme material , social and emotional poverty in which they live . ”
during the first four years of its existence , the foundation provided aid to more than 125,000 children in brazil alone . dreaming of art history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal family celebrated silvia 's birthday with an outing at the opera on monday .

" it was a wonderful gathering , " said gunilla von arbin , the world childhood foundation 's secretary general . she added that the establishement of an internet resource guide for swedish children in need called " red pages " was announced at the meeting .
" it 's a new social initiative that has been developed for her majesty , " von arbin told dw-world . before tuesday 's official birthday celebrations , the queen and her family departed to northern sweden for a couple of days , where her children had booked her into a hotel made out of ice , according to news reports . she readily admits that it is not always easy being queen and recently told a swedish news agency about her secret dream of starting something completely new .
“ what i ’ d really like to do is study art history ” like her youngest daughter , silvia said .
“ maybe one day i ’ ll have enough time to sit down at a university desk . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what ’ s a prince in love to do ?

germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .
that only became possible after carl gustav became king in 1973 , however , as swedish crown princes lose their claim to the throne if they marry a commoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three decades after meeting at the munich olympic games , carl gustav and silvia attended the 2002 winter games in utah .
the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .
“ we must fight against the extreme material , social and emotional poverty in which they live . ”
during the first four years of its existence , the foundation provided aid to more than 125,000 children in brazil alone . dreaming of art history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal family celebrated silvia 's birthday with an outing at the opera on monday .

" it was a wonderful gathering , " said gunilla von arbin , the world childhood foundation 's secretary general . she added that the establishement of an internet resource guide for swedish children in need called " red pages " was announced at the meeting .
" it 's a new social initiative that has been developed for her majesty , " von arbin told dw-world . before tuesday 's official birthday celebrations , the queen and her family departed to northern sweden for a couple of days , where her children had booked her into a hotel made out of ice , according to news reports . she readily admits that it is not always easy being queen and recently told a swedish news agency about her secret dream of starting something completely new .
“ what i ’ d really like to do is study art history ” like her youngest daughter , silvia said .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .

serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .

in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .
they face up to 40 years each in jail if convicted .
the rest will be tried in absentia .
among other crimes , the suspects are charged with murder , terrorism and organized crime . a rushed trial ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defendant mladjan micic , center , sits with jail security officers in a bullet-proof box in the court room on tuesday .
opposition members have accused the government of rushing the case to trial before the election despite the fact that a majority of suspects is still on the run .
serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .
while the prosecutor has identified jovanovic as the only shooter , one of djindjic ’ s bodyguards has said the bullets came from different directions . even serbian interior minister dusan mihajlovic has expressed doubts that the details of the assassination will become clear without the arrest of the group ’ s alleged mastermind , milorad “ legija ” lukovic , a former chief of the so-called red berets paramilitary unit . criminals had links to government lukovic is the alleged head of the so-called “ zemun clan , ” a mafia-like organization that flourished during serbia 's international isolation through its links to the government of former serbian president slobodan milosevic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped to overthrow milosevic in 2000 and outraged nationalists by sending him to the war crimes court in the hague , apparently planned a crackdown on crime gangs like the zemun clan before he was murdered . nationalists ahead in polls the trial opened just days before sunday ’ s general elections in serbia .
three years ago , a coalition of parties , including djindjic ’ s democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , managed to win two-thirds of the votes . however , that coalition broke apart a few weeks ago and former political allies now accuse each other of corruption , abuse of office and connections to organized crime .
djindjic ’ s course of western-style economic and political reforms has been put on hold . recent polls suggest that as a result of this , nationalist parties could emerge as the leading vote-getters this time : milosevic ’ s socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- and the right-extremist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- .

germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .
that only became possible after carl gustav became king in 1973 , however , as swedish crown princes lose their claim to the throne if they marry a commoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three decades after meeting at the munich olympic games , carl gustav and silvia attended the 2002 winter games in utah .
the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .
“ we must fight against the extreme material , social and emotional poverty in which they live . ”
during the first four years of its existence , the foundation provided aid to more than 125,000 children in brazil alone . dreaming of art history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal family celebrated silvia 's birthday with an outing at the opera on monday .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .
they face up to 40 years each in jail if convicted .
the rest will be tried in absentia .
among other crimes , the suspects are charged with murder , terrorism and organized crime . a rushed trial ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defendant mladjan micic , center , sits with jail security officers in a bullet-proof box in the court room on tuesday .
opposition members have accused the government of rushing the case to trial before the election despite the fact that a majority of suspects is still on the run .
serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .
while the prosecutor has identified jovanovic as the only shooter , one of djindjic ’ s bodyguards has said the bullets came from different directions . even serbian interior minister dusan mihajlovic has expressed doubts that the details of the assassination will become clear without the arrest of the group ’ s alleged mastermind , milorad “ legija ” lukovic , a former chief of the so-called red berets paramilitary unit . criminals had links to government lukovic is the alleged head of the so-called “ zemun clan , ” a mafia-like organization that flourished during serbia 's international isolation through its links to the government of former serbian president slobodan milosevic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped to overthrow milosevic in 2000 and outraged nationalists by sending him to the war crimes court in the hague , apparently planned a crackdown on crime gangs like the zemun clan before he was murdered . nationalists ahead in polls the trial opened just days before sunday ’ s general elections in serbia .
three years ago , a coalition of parties , including djindjic ’ s democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- , managed to win two-thirds of the votes . however , that coalition broke apart a few weeks ago and former political allies now accuse each other of corruption , abuse of office and connections to organized crime .
djindjic ’ s course of western-style economic and political reforms has been put on hold . recent polls suggest that as a result of this , nationalist parties could emerge as the leading vote-getters this time : milosevic ’ s socialist party -lrb- sps -rrb- and the right-extremist serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- .

germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .
that only became possible after carl gustav became king in 1973 , however , as swedish crown princes lose their claim to the throne if they marry a commoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three decades after meeting at the munich olympic games , carl gustav and silvia attended the 2002 winter games in utah .
the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .

serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .

germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .
that only became possible after carl gustav became king in 1973 , however , as swedish crown princes lose their claim to the throne if they marry a commoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three decades after meeting at the munich olympic games , carl gustav and silvia attended the 2002 winter games in utah .
the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .
“ we must fight against the extreme material , social and emotional poverty in which they live . ”

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .

serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .
they face up to 40 years each in jail if convicted .
the rest will be tried in absentia .
among other crimes , the suspects are charged with murder , terrorism and organized crime . a rushed trial ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defendant mladjan micic , center , sits with jail security officers in a bullet-proof box in the court room on tuesday .
opposition members have accused the government of rushing the case to trial before the election despite the fact that a majority of suspects is still on the run .
serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .
while the prosecutor has identified jovanovic as the only shooter , one of djindjic ’ s bodyguards has said the bullets came from different directions . even serbian interior minister dusan mihajlovic has expressed doubts that the details of the assassination will become clear without the arrest of the group ’ s alleged mastermind , milorad “ legija ” lukovic , a former chief of the so-called red berets paramilitary unit . criminals had links to government lukovic is the alleged head of the so-called “ zemun clan , ” a mafia-like organization that flourished during serbia 's international isolation through its links to the government of former serbian president slobodan milosevic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped to overthrow milosevic in 2000 and outraged nationalists by sending him to the war crimes court in the hague , apparently planned a crackdown on crime gangs like the zemun clan before he was murdered . nationalists ahead in polls the trial opened just days before sunday ’ s general elections in serbia .

germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .

the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .

the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .

the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .

as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election . serbia ’ s supreme court on tuesday turned down a request by defense lawyers to remove the three judges and the prosecutor in the case .
in his opening statement , the prosecutor accused the suspects of killing djindjic to topple his government . more than nine months after djindjic ’ s assassination outside his office in belgrade on march 12 , the alleged shooter , former elite police officer zvezdan jovanovic , and other defendants had begun to stand trial in a high-security courtroom on monday . only 21 of the 36 suspects in djindjic ’ s murder are in prison , however .

opposition members have accused the government of rushing the case to trial before the election despite the fact that a majority of suspects is still on the run .
serbian justice minister vladan batic has rejected the claims , saying that the state could not wait forever to start the trial . whether djindjic ’ s murder will ever be solved remains uncertain .
while the prosecutor has identified jovanovic as the only shooter , one of djindjic ’ s bodyguards has said the bullets came from different directions . even serbian interior minister dusan mihajlovic has expressed doubts that the details of the assassination will become clear without the arrest of the group ’ s alleged mastermind , milorad “ legija ” lukovic , a former chief of the so-called red berets paramilitary unit . criminals had links to government lukovic is the alleged head of the so-called “ zemun clan , ” a mafia-like organization that flourished during serbia 's international isolation through its links to the government of former serbian president slobodan milosevic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped to overthrow milosevic in 2000 and outraged nationalists by sending him to the war crimes court in the hague , apparently planned a crackdown on crime gangs like the zemun clan before he was murdered . nationalists ahead in polls the trial opened just days before sunday ’ s general elections in serbia .

germans may have abolished the monarchy in 1918 , but they still have “ our silvia ” of sweden .
the heidelberg native , who married king carl xvi gustav almost three decades ago , celebrated her 60th birthday on tuesday . as chief hostess and interpreter for the 1972 olympic games in munich , silvia renate sommerlath looked after a range of celebrities : german chancellor willy brandt , british prime minister edward heath and monaco ’ s royal couple , among others . it was the swedish crown prince , however , who won her heart by staring at her through his binoculars .
“ my husband once said : it just clicked , ” silvia recently told german public television .
“ i believe in destiny and it was no coincidence that we met . ” a commoner fit to be queen having spent 10 years of her childhood in her mother ’ s native brazil and being fluent in seven languages , the dark-haired young woman seemed worldly enough to become queen .
that only became possible after carl gustav became king in 1973 , however , as swedish crown princes lose their claim to the throne if they marry a commoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three decades after meeting at the munich olympic games , carl gustav and silvia attended the 2002 winter games in utah .
the wedding took place on june 19 , 1976 , and silvia quickly became one of the most popular members of the swedish royal family , helping to ensure its survival .
while many of her new countrymen had previously called for abolishing the monarchy , about 70 percent of swedes now want to preserve it . children ’ s advocate however , some have criticized the queen for her outspoken comments on political issues , such as calling for harsher punishments for child molesters . it doesn ’ t seem to have detracted silvia , who is herself a mother of three – crown princess victoria , 26 , prince carl philip , 24 , and princess madeleine , 21 .
“ if i can help children , i ’ ll keep interfering vigorously , ” she said in an interview on germany ’ s ard television . “ the goal is to promote the right of every child to its childhood and to work for better living conditions for children in danger , ” silvia wrote on the web site of world childhood foundation , a charity she created in 1999 .
“ we must fight against the extreme material , social and emotional poverty in which they live . ”
during the first four years of its existence , the foundation provided aid to more than 125,000 children in brazil alone . dreaming of art history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swedish royal family celebrated silvia 's birthday with an outing at the opera on monday .

silvia ’ s birthday wish , a round table on the current problems of children in swedish society , already took place at the royal palace in stockholm on dec .
12 .
" it was a wonderful gathering , " said gunilla von arbin , the world childhood foundation 's secretary general . she added that the establishement of an internet resource guide for swedish children in need called " red pages " was announced at the meeting .
" it 's a new social initiative that has been developed for her majesty , " von arbin told dw-world . before tuesday 's official birthday celebrations , the queen and her family departed to northern sweden for a couple of days , where her children had booked her into a hotel made out of ice , according to news reports . she readily admits that it is not always easy being queen and recently told a swedish news agency about her secret dream of starting something completely new .
“ what i ’ d really like to do is study art history ” like her youngest daughter , silvia said .

the £ 5 daily charge has cut the traffic in central london since it was introduced in february .
just over 40 % of londoners questioned were in favour of the charge , with 31 % against .
but a poll by icm for bbc 's newsnight found 53 % of people living outside the city were against a similar scheme in their area .
the survey found just 22 % of non-londoners were in favour of the scheme .
in total , 1,004 people were interviewed , and 49 english unitary authorities and metropolitan district councils were also surveyed .
congestion charge facts there are now 60,000 fewer car journeys a day in central london traffic delays inside the congestion zone are down 30 % journey times have fallen by 14 % .
the charge is set to raise £ 68m for public transport in 2003 it is hoped in 2005 the scheme will raise £ 100m only one unnamed authority said it was actively considering a congestion charging scheme and 34 said they would watch how other schemes developed .
seven were totally opposed to the idea , while another seven said they were unlikely to give it serious consideration within the next few years , newsnight found .
there were 16 authorities which believed that congestion charges would be extensively used in cities and town centres nationwide in the next 10 years .
but 26 authorities thought it would only spread to a few more places in that time .
mayor of london ken livingstone 's transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- , has begun a six-week consultation with politicians on extending the zone westwards within london .
a 10-week public consultation will follow before mr livingstone decides if he puts it in his manifesto for next june 's mayoral elections .
a tfl spokesman said : " there is now more support than opposition for congestion charging in london .
" a reversal of this pattern where congestion charging is not in force and its benefits are therefore not apparent is perhaps what you would expect - and echoes a similar pattern of views in london before the charge was introduced . "

the extra money raised will be invested in crime reduction .
other devon councils will discuss the issue in january .

he said of the possibility : " if it does , and that home becomes available to a local resident who would n't otherwise have the opportunity to buy , then that would be a good thing .

the extra money raised will be invested in crime reduction .

deputy colin egre says he was not told about a planning meeting which gave permission for the development to be built in st peter .
last friday , developers dandara were given permission to build 99 sheltered units and 51 cottages on the site of the former l 'hermitage hotel .
but deputy egre claims neither he nor the parish constable were told the meeting was happening .
dandara was given permission for the development after reaching a compromise about the size of the project with the planning department .
deputy egre says he has a number of concerns and feels he is now unable to make an informed comment and fairly represent his voters .
he said : " it 's going to change the whole character of the area .
" there are concerns about traffic and the resulting water run-off of any development as well as sewage . "
