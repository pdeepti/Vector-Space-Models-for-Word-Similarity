program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.10.2003 susan sontag receives german peace prize , criticizes u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .
other illustrious recipients include hermann hesse , vaclav havel , jürgen habermas , and last year ’ s winner chinua acheba from nigeria . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de susan sontag wins german peace prize the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize -lrb- june 21 , 2003 -rrb- .

as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "
starting from scratch ?
bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .
toll collect faces fines toll collect has ruled out the possibility of being held responsible for the government ’ s lost revenues .
a spokesman for the consortium said there have " neither been talks about penalty demands nor a basis for doing so . "
but the company could be forced to pay € 250,000 -lrb- $ 292,000 -rrb- a day in fines if the system isn ’ t in operation by january .
the project ’ s first casualty could be michael rummel , toll collect ’ s chief executive .
the newsweekly der spiegel reported this week that representatives of the consortium were negotiating the termination of his contract , but toll collect refuse to confirm the report when questioned by the public broadcaster ard .
until the system is fixed , the government estimates it will lose € 154 million -lrb- $ 180 million -rrb- for each month the tolls remain uncollected . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "

bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .
toll collect faces fines toll collect has ruled out the possibility of being held responsible for the government ’ s lost revenues .
a spokesman for the consortium said there have " neither been talks about penalty demands nor a basis for doing so . "
but the company could be forced to pay € 250,000 -lrb- $ 292,000 -rrb- a day in fines if the system isn ’ t in operation by january .
the project ’ s first casualty could be michael rummel , toll collect ’ s chief executive .
the newsweekly der spiegel reported this week that representatives of the consortium were negotiating the termination of his contract , but toll collect refuse to confirm the report when questioned by the public broadcaster ard .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.10.2003 susan sontag receives german peace prize , criticizes u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .

as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "
starting from scratch ?
bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .

" , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .

she added that german women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer tina theune-meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , coach of the best team of the tournament and the first woman to lead a team to a world cup win , was ecstatic .
" it ’ s pure happiness , " she said after the match on sunday .
" my thanks to the team who managed to make up for trailing behind earlier . "
gerhard mayer-vorfelder , president of germany ’ s soccer association , lauded the squad ’ s performance .
" i ’ m incredibly happy .
it ’ s a proud day for german soccer . "
fifa president joseph blatter summed up the praise being showered on the team from all sides .
" the german team plays the best soccer .
so logically , they deserve the world cup title . "
heroes again for germany back home , a soccer-crazy nation was still reveling in the victory that the men 's team failed to bring home when they lost to brazil in the world cup finals last year . german mass-selling daily bild screamed " we once again have heroes ! " , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .
sparking interest in women 's soccer supporters of women 's soccer hope the world cup win will also provide a boost to the game back home .
interest in the women ’ s national team lags far behind enthusiasm in the men ’ s national squad , which has won three world cup titles .
jana wiske , a report for kicker , a popular soccer magazine told the new york times , " in germany , soccer is a man ’ s game . "
she added that german women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine .
coach theune-meyer thinks sunday ’ s win might change that .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .
though forecasts vary , all agree that europe 's largest economy will have to slash its growth forecast of 0.75 percent this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german debt reaches new record high finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2003 shipping companies put brakes on toll system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : called " simple and practical " by its planners , the toll system has proved anything but .
as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "
starting from scratch ?
bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .
toll collect faces fines toll collect has ruled out the possibility of being held responsible for the government ’ s lost revenues .
a spokesman for the consortium said there have " neither been talks about penalty demands nor a basis for doing so . "
but the company could be forced to pay € 250,000 -lrb- $ 292,000 -rrb- a day in fines if the system isn ’ t in operation by january .
the project ’ s first casualty could be michael rummel , toll collect ’ s chief executive .
the newsweekly der spiegel reported this week that representatives of the consortium were negotiating the termination of his contract , but toll collect refuse to confirm the report when questioned by the public broadcaster ard .
until the system is fixed , the government estimates it will lose € 154 million -lrb- $ 180 million -rrb- for each month the tolls remain uncollected . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .

criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer tina theune-meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , coach of the best team of the tournament and the first woman to lead a team to a world cup win , was ecstatic .
" it ’ s pure happiness , " she said after the match on sunday .
" my thanks to the team who managed to make up for trailing behind earlier . "
gerhard mayer-vorfelder , president of germany ’ s soccer association , lauded the squad ’ s performance .
" i ’ m incredibly happy .
it ’ s a proud day for german soccer . "
fifa president joseph blatter summed up the praise being showered on the team from all sides .
" the german team plays the best soccer .
so logically , they deserve the world cup title . "
heroes again for germany back home , a soccer-crazy nation was still reveling in the victory that the men 's team failed to bring home when they lost to brazil in the world cup finals last year . german mass-selling daily bild screamed " we once again have heroes ! " , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .
sparking interest in women 's soccer supporters of women 's soccer hope the world cup win will also provide a boost to the game back home .
interest in the women ’ s national team lags far behind enthusiasm in the men ’ s national squad , which has won three world cup titles .
jana wiske , a report for kicker , a popular soccer magazine told the new york times , " in germany , soccer is a man ’ s game . "
she added that german women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine .
coach theune-meyer thinks sunday ’ s win might change that .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer tina theune-meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , coach of the best team of the tournament and the first woman to lead a team to a world cup win , was ecstatic .
" it ’ s pure happiness , " she said after the match on sunday .
" my thanks to the team who managed to make up for trailing behind earlier . "
gerhard mayer-vorfelder , president of germany ’ s soccer association , lauded the squad ’ s performance .
" i ’ m incredibly happy .
it ’ s a proud day for german soccer . "
fifa president joseph blatter summed up the praise being showered on the team from all sides .
" the german team plays the best soccer .
so logically , they deserve the world cup title . "
heroes again for germany back home , a soccer-crazy nation was still reveling in the victory that the men 's team failed to bring home when they lost to brazil in the world cup finals last year . german mass-selling daily bild screamed " we once again have heroes ! " , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .
sparking interest in women 's soccer supporters of women 's soccer hope the world cup win will also provide a boost to the game back home .
interest in the women ’ s national team lags far behind enthusiasm in the men ’ s national squad , which has won three world cup titles .
jana wiske , a report for kicker , a popular soccer magazine told the new york times , " in germany , soccer is a man ’ s game . "
she added that german women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine .
coach theune-meyer thinks sunday ’ s win might change that .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2003 shipping companies put brakes on toll system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : called " simple and practical " by its planners , the toll system has proved anything but .
as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "
starting from scratch ?
bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .
toll collect faces fines toll collect has ruled out the possibility of being held responsible for the government ’ s lost revenues .
a spokesman for the consortium said there have " neither been talks about penalty demands nor a basis for doing so . "
but the company could be forced to pay € 250,000 -lrb- $ 292,000 -rrb- a day in fines if the system isn ’ t in operation by january .
the project ’ s first casualty could be michael rummel , toll collect ’ s chief executive .
the newsweekly der spiegel reported this week that representatives of the consortium were negotiating the termination of his contract , but toll collect refuse to confirm the report when questioned by the public broadcaster ard .
until the system is fixed , the government estimates it will lose € 154 million -lrb- $ 180 million -rrb- for each month the tolls remain uncollected . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .
though forecasts vary , all agree that europe 's largest economy will have to slash its growth forecast of 0.75 percent this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german debt reaches new record high finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer tina theune-meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , coach of the best team of the tournament and the first woman to lead a team to a world cup win , was ecstatic .
" it ’ s pure happiness , " she said after the match on sunday .
" my thanks to the team who managed to make up for trailing behind earlier . "
gerhard mayer-vorfelder , president of germany ’ s soccer association , lauded the squad ’ s performance .
" i ’ m incredibly happy .
it ’ s a proud day for german soccer . "
fifa president joseph blatter summed up the praise being showered on the team from all sides .
" the german team plays the best soccer .
so logically , they deserve the world cup title . "
heroes again for germany back home , a soccer-crazy nation was still reveling in the victory that the men 's team failed to bring home when they lost to brazil in the world cup finals last year . german mass-selling daily bild screamed " we once again have heroes ! " , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .
sparking interest in women 's soccer supporters of women 's soccer hope the world cup win will also provide a boost to the game back home .
interest in the women ’ s national team lags far behind enthusiasm in the men ’ s national squad , which has won three world cup titles .
jana wiske , a report for kicker , a popular soccer magazine told the new york times , " in germany , soccer is a man ’ s game . "
she added that german women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine .
coach theune-meyer thinks sunday ’ s win might change that .

from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .

" , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .

as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .

shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .

" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .

bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .

as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "
starting from scratch ?
bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .

on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .
though forecasts vary , all agree that europe 's largest economy will have to slash its growth forecast of 0.75 percent this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german debt reaches new record high finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences .
-lrb- october 12 , 2003 -rrb- paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year .

as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "
starting from scratch ?
bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .
toll collect faces fines toll collect has ruled out the possibility of being held responsible for the government ’ s lost revenues .
a spokesman for the consortium said there have " neither been talks about penalty demands nor a basis for doing so . "
but the company could be forced to pay € 250,000 -lrb- $ 292,000 -rrb- a day in fines if the system isn ’ t in operation by january .
the project ’ s first casualty could be michael rummel , toll collect ’ s chief executive .
the newsweekly der spiegel reported this week that representatives of the consortium were negotiating the termination of his contract , but toll collect refuse to confirm the report when questioned by the public broadcaster ard .
until the system is fixed , the government estimates it will lose € 154 million -lrb- $ 180 million -rrb- for each month the tolls remain uncollected . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .

kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .

" , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .
sparking interest in women 's soccer supporters of women 's soccer hope the world cup win will also provide a boost to the game back home .
interest in the women ’ s national team lags far behind enthusiasm in the men ’ s national squad , which has won three world cup titles .
jana wiske , a report for kicker , a popular soccer magazine told the new york times , " in germany , soccer is a man ’ s game . "
she added that german women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .

criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .

as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.10.2003 susan sontag receives german peace prize , criticizes u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nia kunzer , bottom right , is mobbed by teammates after scoring the golden goal .
kuenzer , better known as a television commentator than a player , had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with germany ’ s national team – during the 2001 european championships , when germany beat sweden , 1-0 also with a " golden goal . "
on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .
along with the world cup title , germany has now also risen to number one in the women 's soccer world rankings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer tina theune-meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- , coach of the best team of the tournament and the first woman to lead a team to a world cup win , was ecstatic .
" it ’ s pure happiness , " she said after the match on sunday .
" my thanks to the team who managed to make up for trailing behind earlier . "
gerhard mayer-vorfelder , president of germany ’ s soccer association , lauded the squad ’ s performance .
" i ’ m incredibly happy .
it ’ s a proud day for german soccer . "
fifa president joseph blatter summed up the praise being showered on the team from all sides .
" the german team plays the best soccer .
so logically , they deserve the world cup title . "
heroes again for germany back home , a soccer-crazy nation was still reveling in the victory that the men 's team failed to bring home when they lost to brazil in the world cup finals last year . german mass-selling daily bild screamed " we once again have heroes ! " , including the women 's soccer champs on its front page along with michael schumacher , who won his record sixth formula one championship on sunday .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally invited the victorious women for a chat at his office in berlin and apologized he couldn ’ t take time off from his hectic reform debate to fly to california personally and watch them in action .
sparking interest in women 's soccer supporters of women 's soccer hope the world cup win will also provide a boost to the game back home .
interest in the women ’ s national team lags far behind enthusiasm in the men ’ s national squad , which has won three world cup titles .
jana wiske , a report for kicker , a popular soccer magazine told the new york times , " in germany , soccer is a man ’ s game . "
she added that german women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine .
coach theune-meyer thinks sunday ’ s win might change that .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .
other illustrious recipients include hermann hesse , vaclav havel , jürgen habermas , and last year ’ s winner chinua acheba from nigeria . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de susan sontag wins german peace prize the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize -lrb- june 21 , 2003 -rrb- .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .
though forecasts vary , all agree that europe 's largest economy will have to slash its growth forecast of 0.75 percent this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german debt reaches new record high finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .

on sunday , the 5 feet 6 inches tall kuenzer once again displayed her winning form as she twisted her body 12 yards from the goal and flicked a header past the outstretched arm of swedish goalkeeper , caroline joensson , to bring home the title .
" proud day for german soccer " the germans went unbeaten in the tournament , winning all five of their matches and even beat defending champions the united states 3-0 in the semi-finals .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .
though forecasts vary , all agree that europe 's largest economy will have to slash its growth forecast of 0.75 percent this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german debt reaches new record high finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences .

" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?

shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .
though forecasts vary , all agree that europe 's largest economy will have to slash its growth forecast of 0.75 percent this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german debt reaches new record high finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .
toll collect faces fines toll collect has ruled out the possibility of being held responsible for the government ’ s lost revenues .
a spokesman for the consortium said there have " neither been talks about penalty demands nor a basis for doing so . "
but the company could be forced to pay € 250,000 -lrb- $ 292,000 -rrb- a day in fines if the system isn ’ t in operation by january .
the project ’ s first casualty could be michael rummel , toll collect ’ s chief executive .
the newsweekly der spiegel reported this week that representatives of the consortium were negotiating the termination of his contract , but toll collect refuse to confirm the report when questioned by the public broadcaster ard .
until the system is fixed , the government estimates it will lose € 154 million -lrb- $ 180 million -rrb- for each month the tolls remain uncollected . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding . following one of their now-regular informal talks on sunday evening , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac called for patience in the european union regarding decision to flout eu budget deficit rules in order to help spark growth in the euro zone 's two largest economies .
" the eu commission and the partner countries in the eu must be interested in seeing the economy grow in germany in france , " schröder told reporters outside chirac 's presidential office in paris .
with the comments , schröder and chirac were once again taking aim at the eu stability and growth pact .
the agreement , designed to protect the value of the single currency the euro , calls for sanctions if a country 's deficit exceeds three percent of its growth domestic product .
eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes told the french paper le monde that despite forecasts that france 's deficit would reach 5 percent , he would not penalize the french government in 2004 .
" to ask france to reduce its public deficit from four percent in 2003 to less than three percent in 2004 would be to demand an effort which would be difficult to justify from an economic point of view , " solbes said in the interview published saturday .
deficit largest in post-war history during sunday 's remarks before the press , chirac echoed those comments , adding that no one should " negate the recognizable first signs of an economic upswing . "
france was under pressure , both from fellow eu states angered at its ballooning deficit and solbes , to take immediate action against the problem .
solbes said he expects france to get its deficit under the three percent threshold in 2005 .
germany is arguing a similar line .
schröder asked for a " flexible interpretation " of the stability pact on sunday , a day after his finance minister said new german borrowing could reach more than € 40 billion this year .
the figure would surpass all of the predictions made by the german finance ministry in the past .
a € 40 billion euro deficit would be the biggest in postwar history and will likely ensure a stability pact violation of over four percent , more than the 3.8 percent has predicted by the ministry up until now .
with only meager growth prospects for next year , the country could be on course to violate the pact for a third year in 2004 .
schröder said sunday that he believes brussels is beginning to understand the dilemma of the eu 's two largest economies .
like france , germany is expecting almost zero growth this year .
though forecasts vary , all agree that europe 's largest economy will have to slash its growth forecast of 0.75 percent this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german debt reaches new record high finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .
" golden goal " clinches the trophy the winning goal came from one of the unlikeliest players in the german team - 23-year-old nia kuenzer from frankfurt , who entered in the 88th minute sunday , expecting to provide some more power with her rested form .

soccer-crazy germany on monday was euphoric after the women 's national team became world champions for the first time following a 2-1 victory over sweden by “ golden goal ” on sunday . five-time european championship winners and 1995 world cup runners-up , the german women 's soccer team finally took home the world championship trophy on sunday after defeating a feisty swedish squad in extra time .
playing in front of a 26,000-strong crowd that favored the swedes in carson , california , the two teams provided a suspense-packed game with a combination of technical skill , attacking tactics and agile ball handling .
from the 25th minute germany 's star forward birgit prinz , the tournament ’ s leading scorer and most valuable player , pounded the swedish goalie with rushes , all which only narrowly missed their destination .
the scandinavians responded by increasing their counterattacks , led by victoria svensson .
in the 41st minute that pressure paid off , as hanna ljungberg drove the ball into germany ’ s net , putting sweden in the lead .
not to be cowed down , the determined germans fought back with midfielder maren meinert scoring the equalizer in the 46th minute .
the two teams were then tied throughout the rest of the game .

"
with a swipe at u.s. president bush and his " imperial program , " the american novelist , playwright and critic accepted the prestigious peace prize from the german booksellers ’ association on sunday . one of america ’ s foremost writers and intellectuals was bestowed with germany ’ s highest literary honor at the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
the german booksellers ’ association , which hands out the annual peace prize , hailed susan sontag for her " exceptional sense of morality and immorality . "
she is no diplomat , the association ’ s director dieter schormann said in his address at frankfurt 's paulskirche , adding that sontag sees her first duty in speaking the truth .
" in a world of false images and distorted truths , she defends the honor of free thought . "
sontag ’ s outspoken opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its response to the september 11 terrorist attacks has frequently led to sharp criticism in her home country .
but the 70 year-old , whose novels , essays and short stories have been translated into more than 30 languages , is generally seen in germany as the american intellectual par excellence , the public conscience of an arrogant superpower .
defending civilization in her acceptance speech , sontag held true to her reputation .
she seized the opportunity to criticize president george w. bush ’ s administration .
she drew attention to the " deliberate absence " from the ceremony of the u.s. ambassador to germany as typical of washington ’ s current ideology of distancing itself from " old europe . "
she went on to lament a transatlantic divide shaped by " latent antagonism " and america ’ s view that it alone could save civilization .
" they see themselves as defending civilization .
the barbarians are outside the gates , " she said describing the attitude of many americans , who believe , that as long as " god is on its side , " nothing can go wrong .
" americans have gotten used to seeing the world in terms of enemies .
terrorist is a more flexible word than communist , " the author of polish-lithuanian-jewish descent told the audience .
transatlantic divide sontag , who has spent much of her literary life going back and forth between europe and the united states , questioned why europe and america had drifted so far apart .
criticizing bush ’ s " imperial program , " she lambasted defense secretary donald rumsfeld ’ s division of europe into old and new .
the author , who was in germany at the time of 9/11 , described the outpouring of sympathy the europeans felt for the united sates , but said much of it had been squandered since then .
" what has followed is an increasing estrangement on both sides . "
" how odd , that when europe and america are so culturally similar , there is such a divide , " she added .
role model for intellectuals for an author who has made a career out of wielding her pen for political causes , such critical statements are nothing new .
sontag has used her intellectual reputation to draw attention to injustices around the world .
from the vietnam war to the death threat against writer salman rushdie , the israeli policy in the palestinian territories or the bombardment of sarajevo , sontag ’ s critical voice has always sounded loud and clear .
in her refusal to shy away from controversy when it comes to speaking out against war and conflict , sontag serves as a " role model for intellectuals , " according to the writer and theater director ivan nagel , who gave the laudation on sunday .
with her fiction and political essays , sontag questions and defends " the concept and the value of western civilization . "
the peace prize , which comes with a cash award of € 15,000 , has been awarded by the german bookseller ’ s association every year since 1950 .
it is given in recognition of an individual ’ s lifetime work in the fields of literature , art or science which contributes to the promotion of peace .
other illustrious recipients include hermann hesse , vaclav havel , jürgen habermas , and last year ’ s winner chinua acheba from nigeria . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de susan sontag wins german peace prize the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize -lrb- june 21 , 2003 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2003 shipping companies put brakes on toll system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : called " simple and practical " by its planners , the toll system has proved anything but .
as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott . the planners of germany ’ s new toll system for heavy trucks wanted to create a model high-tech system that deployed satellites , dashboard computers , toll bridges and payment machines to collect some € 2.8 billion -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- a year without the burden of expensive employees .
instead , it ’ s proven to be an expensive headache at a time when the german government is running up a record budget deficit .
originally slated for operation in august , the defective system now has no launch date in sight , and blame is being thrown in all directions .
truckers boycott system the german truck drivers ’ association disclosed over the weekend that most shipping companies have all but abandoned the system and say they won ’ t participate again until toll collect , the consortium led by deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler behind the expensive project , and the government deliver a working system . the government , meanwhile , has threatened to sue toll collect and cancel its contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shipping companies have stopped installing the toll system and are not replacing defective appliances with new ones , " said karlheinz schmidt , president of the german transport and disposal association -lrb- bgl -rrb- , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
schmidt said a recent survey taken by his organization found that only one in 15 of the onboard toll computers was functioning .
" why should we participate in a test run when the technology is still defective ?
i ’ m only going to take part again until the system ’ s working , " he said .
shipping companies are also clashing with toll collect , the consortium of companies responsible for implementing the ambitious highway tolls .
" they haven ’ t planned these tests very reasonably , " said sebastian lechner , head of bgl ’ s bavarian branch , according to the paper .
" it ’ s still completely unclear when and how the next test phase is supposed to begin .
it changes from day to day . "
starting from scratch ?
bgl ’ s schmidt said he didn ’ t believe the truck toll could be implemented by the new easter target date unless the government , parliament and the toll consortium stop their bickering and deliver concrete results .
" toll collect 's partner firms , daimlerchrysler and deutsche telekom , need to find money and begin planning the system again from the ground up , " schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe german transportation minister manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- of the social democrats recently conceded that he had become aware of the full extent of problems with toll collect one month before the system ’ s planned nationwide introduction in august .
" the full explosiveness of the situation first became apparent during the summer , " stolpe said .
" prior to that , there had been different statements about small deficiencies , but it only became obvious in july that the whole system wasn ’ t ready for service . "
stolpe also said the government would seek the highest possible compensation during negotiations with toll collect .
" we ’ re going to look at the contract for possible penalties and we ’ ll also be discussing lost revenues , " stolpe told the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper .
the transportation minister recently revealed that an exit clause exists in the contract , and he has begun publicly toying with the idea of terminating the government ’ s contract with toll collect .
" we have several cancellation dates that are dependent on development progress , " he said .
stolpe estimated the government would lose € 900 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in revenues if the system isn ’ t implemented until early next year .
given the staggering revenue loss , a number of parliamentarians have called for the full disclosure of the contract – a move that could increase public pressure on the government to seek damages from toll collect .
so far , the companies have not released the document , but a statement is expected on tuesday .
toll collect faces fines toll collect has ruled out the possibility of being held responsible for the government ’ s lost revenues .
a spokesman for the consortium said there have " neither been talks about penalty demands nor a basis for doing so . "
but the company could be forced to pay € 250,000 -lrb- $ 292,000 -rrb- a day in fines if the system isn ’ t in operation by january .

the moves come as communist party leaders attending the 16th party congress in beijing may back a constitutional amendment allowing private property for the first time .
rules published on monday could lead to more widespread use of derivatives , complex bets on future market performance .
the slow move towards derivatives comes ahead of china 's 2006 world trade organisation deadline for opening up its banks to overseas competition .
china has been nervous about allowing the trade ever since the barings scandal of the 1990s , where the british bank was brought down by a trader misusing derivatives .
the rules remain stringent , demanding regulatory approval before trading and long experience on the part of the staff responsible .
foreign firms wanting to trade derivatives will have to show evidence that their headquarters are adequately supervised .
that may prove difficult , since in the us , for example , the derivatives trade is much less regulated than equity or bond trading .
private ownership meanwhile , the party congress deliberations on private property are also keenly awaited .
should the much-touted amendment come about - and thus far no-one is sure it is even on the agenda - it could underwrite a more stable legal system , a common complaint among the investors who have rushed into china in recent years .
china 's leaders have been edging towards private property rules since a 1999 amendment which said private business was an " important component " of the economy .
but the communist party is still walking a tightrope , wanting to use the energy of enterprise without ceding any political control .
ceding control of the currency , for instance , remains off the agenda despite heavy pressure from the us .
president george w bush is due at the asia pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in bangkok this week , and may well tackle chinese president hu jintao in person on the issue .

job numbers have fallen to 3.5 million from 4.2 million in 1998 , backing up union warnings that the sector is in crisis .
derek simpson , general secretary of the amicus trade union , said : " not only are 10-12,000 manufacturing jobs being lost every week in the uk but they are being replaced by low-skilled , low-paid and insecure jobs .
" these statistics are devastating , not only for the individuals and families affected , but for the entire uk economy in the longer term . "
staff cutbacks the sector accounted for 17 % of all jobs in the spring of 1998 , but that figure had dropped to 14 % by this year , the ons said .
the textiles and leather industries have suffered the biggest cutbacks over the past few years , with employment slashed by about half .
other sectors that have faced job cuts include transport equipment , electrical and optical equipment , metals , chemicals , paper and printing .
around 2.6 million men have jobs with manufacturing firms , compared with just under a million women .

the report , entitled bare necessities , is due to be published by think tank democratic dialogue on monday .
it found that more than one third of all children in the province live below the poverty line .
the findings suggest a " scientific " measure of poverty and social exclusion in northern ireland for the first time .
it also claims that poverty in northern ireland is worse than either the republic of ireland or great britain , which are two of the most unequal societies in europe .
the research , directed by professors at both the university of ulster and queen 's university , belfast , is based on a representative sample of more than 3,100 people across northern ireland surveyed between october 2002 and january 2003 .
key findings 37.4 % of ni children are growing up in poor households 67 % of lone parents are in poverty 29 % of women but only 25 % of men are in poor households 56 % of households containing one or more disabled people are in poverty catholics are 1.4 times as likely as protestants to live in poor households the richest 40 % of households together possess 67 % of the total household income in northern ireland the poorest 40 % of households have 17 % of total household income the research measured poverty in terms of both low income and inability to afford things or activities most people regard as necessities of life .
examples of this included " new , not-second hand clothes " , " attending weddings , funerals or similar occasions " and " enough money to pay heating , electricity and telephone bills on time " .
the research found that all sections of the community agree on what the bare necessities of life are .
poor households were found to be those with incomes about half the average and lacking three or more necessities .
the authors conclude that " northern ireland is one of the most unequal societies in the developed world " and they throw up a challenge to the region 's politicians and policy-makers .
" while the divisions around religion , national identity and political preference dominate all discussions in the media , in local council chambers and in the assembly , this study has turned the spotlight to other equally important but less visible divisions of class , gender , age and disability .
" the challenge for northern ireland , as a whole , and local politicians , in particular , is how to reduce these deep fractures of inequality and create a more just society . "
the reduction of poverty and inequality is , they say , " ultimately a matter of political will " .
the bare necessities report was funded by the office of the first minister and deputy first minister , the department of finance and personnel , and the treasury 's evidence-based policy fund .

dr harris , 37 , is said to want to care for 29-year-old girlfriend liz o 'hara , who is suffering from a malignant brain tumour .
the daily mail said he is angry miss o 'hara 's tumour was not diagnosed properly last year .
the paper quotes him as saying she was twice sent away by her gp with headache pills after suffering from headaches last may .
when she was later sent to hospital dr harris said his plea for a brain scan was ignored by a junior doctor .
" i am angry that in this case , despite there being clearly detectable symptoms and signs of something very wrong , that she was sent home from casualty , " the mp for oxford west and abingdon told the newspaper .
he has refused to name the nhs health trust involved .
diagnosis could and should have been made earlier dr evan harris " i 'm not generalising about the nhs but i am saying there is a lesson to be drawn from this case , " the newspaper reports .
dr harris , who is a qualified hospital doctor , said the misdiagnosis was an example of the " doctor knows best " culture in the nhs .
the newspaper says miss o 'hara 's tumour was only diagnosed when she returned to her native ireland .
she is suffering from glioblastoma multiforme , a malignant form of brain tumour .
' great pressure ' miss o 'hara 's symptoms included headaches , vomiting , and a change in personality .
although doctors in dublin removed the tumour after miss o 'hara had lapsed into a coma , her condition is still terminal , the daily mail says .
" diagnosis could and should have been made earlier and the reason for the omission was a straight forward failure to take seriously the complaint of the patient and the concerns of her family , " dr harris is quoted as saying .
" hospital doctors , particularly the junior ones who work at night , are working under great pressure but in this case the diagnosis should have been made . "
dr harris said his partner was " doing well " and the couple had been travelling the world , visiting egypt , prague and south africa .
