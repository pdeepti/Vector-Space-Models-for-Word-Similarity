just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "
members of the united nations , the president said , " now have an opportunity , and the responsibility , to assume a broader role in assuring that iraq becomes a free and democratic nation .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .
bin laden threatens europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden .
in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .

but a spokesperson at the federal ministry of the interior told deutsche welle that the government has no concrete plans at the moment to carry out any " worst case scenario " catastrophe training in any major german city .
however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .
these are the country 's first mobile response vehicles and would be called into action in the event of an attack to determine the threat .

the government has also stockpiled 35 million doses of smallpox vaccine - enough for nearly half the population of germany - and is in the process of acquiring enough vaccine for the entire population in preparation of a biological attack .
it has also recently set up a new high-level agency , the federal office for civil protection and emergency response which will serve as the german government 's central organizational unit for civil security .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2003 europe and u.s. move towards iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new resolution could pave the way for u.n. peacekeepers in iraq .
just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "
members of the united nations , the president said , " now have an opportunity , and the responsibility , to assume a broader role in assuring that iraq becomes a free and democratic nation .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .

in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .

but a spokesperson at the federal ministry of the interior told deutsche welle that the government has no concrete plans at the moment to carry out any " worst case scenario " catastrophe training in any major german city .
however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .
bin laden threatens europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden .
in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .

in october 2002 , the european commission carried out the euratox 2002 trials where crisis teams from france , austria , spain , greece , italy and sweden were tested in a situation where a simulated toxic agent was sprayed over a camp at conjuers in france .
germany increases its preparation plans for exercises similar to those carried out across the united states and most recently in london , are being considered by the german government .
but a spokesperson at the federal ministry of the interior told deutsche welle that the government has no concrete plans at the moment to carry out any " worst case scenario " catastrophe training in any major german city .
however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .
these are the country 's first mobile response vehicles and would be called into action in the event of an attack to determine the threat .

the government has also stockpiled 35 million doses of smallpox vaccine - enough for nearly half the population of germany - and is in the process of acquiring enough vaccine for the entire population in preparation of a biological attack .
it has also recently set up a new high-level agency , the federal office for civil protection and emergency response which will serve as the german government 's central organizational unit for civil security .

the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .

the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.09.2003 europe and u.s. move towards iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new resolution could pave the way for u.n. peacekeepers in iraq .
just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .
bin laden threatens europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden .
in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .

but a spokesperson at the federal ministry of the interior told deutsche welle that the government has no concrete plans at the moment to carry out any " worst case scenario " catastrophe training in any major german city .
however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .
these are the country 's first mobile response vehicles and would be called into action in the event of an attack to determine the threat .

the government has also stockpiled 35 million doses of smallpox vaccine - enough for nearly half the population of germany - and is in the process of acquiring enough vaccine for the entire population in preparation of a biological attack .
it has also recently set up a new high-level agency , the federal office for civil protection and emergency response which will serve as the german government 's central organizational unit for civil security .

the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .

the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .

in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .

but a spokesperson at the federal ministry of the interior told deutsche welle that the government has no concrete plans at the moment to carry out any " worst case scenario " catastrophe training in any major german city .
however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .
these are the country 's first mobile response vehicles and would be called into action in the event of an attack to determine the threat .

the government has also stockpiled 35 million doses of smallpox vaccine - enough for nearly half the population of germany - and is in the process of acquiring enough vaccine for the entire population in preparation of a biological attack .
it has also recently set up a new high-level agency , the federal office for civil protection and emergency response which will serve as the german government 's central organizational unit for civil security .
the french interior ministry could not be drawn on its own plans for future drills but would continue to take part in future european initiatives similar to euratox 2002 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state department praises german anti-terror efforts in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "
members of the united nations , the president said , " now have an opportunity , and the responsibility , to assume a broader role in assuring that iraq becomes a free and democratic nation .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "
members of the united nations , the president said , " now have an opportunity , and the responsibility , to assume a broader role in assuring that iraq becomes a free and democratic nation .

volkswagen , bmw and others are already making vehicles for chinese customers , and now daimlerchrysler has decided to enter the fray . after more than a year of negotiations with its local partner , the beijing automotive industry holding co .
-lrb- baic -rrb- , daimlerchrysler signed a € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- framework agreement in beijing on monday to produce mercedes sedans and trucks in china . " the cooperation agreement with baic marks a very important step for us indeed , " chairman jürgen schrempp said in beijing .

daimlerchrysler spokesman hartmut schick suggested that it would n't take very long , and said the company is expecting the first chinese-made mercedes to roll off the assembly line as soon as 2005 . 20 years on the chinese market so far , daimler has only imported cars to china , although it has already been a presence on the chinese market for 20 years .

nearly 1.13 million vehicles were sold there last year , 56 percent more than in 2001 . volkswagen , general motors , toyota and honda are all major players on the chinese market .
daimlerchrysler 's greatest competitor in china , bmw , signed a joint venture worth € 450 million with brilliance china automotive in march and plans to start producing cars soon . it was just a matter of time until daimlerchrysler expanded operations in china .
" we have been pressing ahead with our china strategy for a long time , " press spokesman schick said .
" the negotiations took over a year ; the result was not a surprising step .
we are now present in all of asia and above all in china in the car and truck segment . " daimlerchrysler already had ties to baic through its 37 percent share in japan 's mitsubishi motors , which manufactures sport utility vehicles together with its chinese partner .
it also owns 10 percent of south korea 's hyundai motors , which makes cars in china too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "
members of the united nations , the president said , " now have an opportunity , and the responsibility , to assume a broader role in assuring that iraq becomes a free and democratic nation .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .

just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .
bin laden threatens europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden .
in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2003 is europe prepared for the inevitable ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's crisis teams are on alert - but how ready are they ?
a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .
bin laden threatens europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden .
in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euratox 2002 .
in october 2002 , the european commission carried out the euratox 2002 trials where crisis teams from france , austria , spain , greece , italy and sweden were tested in a situation where a simulated toxic agent was sprayed over a camp at conjuers in france .
germany increases its preparation plans for exercises similar to those carried out across the united states and most recently in london , are being considered by the german government .
but a spokesperson at the federal ministry of the interior told deutsche welle that the government has no concrete plans at the moment to carry out any " worst case scenario " catastrophe training in any major german city .
however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .
bin laden threatens europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden .
in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .

however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .

a simulated chemical attack on the london underground system this weekend tested britain 's terror response teams .
with experts forecasting european targets in the future , are other capitals prepared for the worst ? if the world ’ s perception had not changed so radically since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states two years ago , the scenes in london on sunday could have easily been mistaken for those from a disaster movie .
in a different time , observers might have looked on with mild interest as hundreds of fire and ambulance staff , backed up by heavily armed police officers in protective suits , carried mock casualties from an underground station in the financial heartland of england ’ s capital .
but this was no film set and the global situation as it is gave events a very serious edge .
in the first major test of its kind carried out by authorities in a major european city , emergency services staged a mock chemical weapons attack on an underground train below london 's banking district in an attempt to gauge the readiness and competence of the capital ’ s response teams in the event of a terrorist attack .
underground attack simulated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's underground system would be a prime target .
using the sarin gas attack on the tokyo underground in 1995 as a template , the simulation involved passengers on a train from waterloo station to bank station being overcome by an unknown chemical .
after being alerted by the tube driver , more than 500 members of the three emergency services sealed off the ‘ hot zone ’ and began evacuating the volunteer " casualties " to street level , some 120 meters above them .
once outside , casualties were decontaminated in special shower tents and transported to hospitals in the capital .
at the same time , people pretending to be affected by the spread of the chemical in a larger ‘ warm zone ’ around the district began arriving at medical centers .
according to the co-coordinators of the test , the main aim of the exercise was to use new diagnostic and treatment equipment and to assess the cohesion between the emergency services .
despite the general consensus among those involved that the exercise was a success and that the structures currently in place worked well , there was an ominous feeling that the controlled conditions of the rehearsal could only achieve so much . resigned to suicide attacks in britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ken livingstone , mayor of london .
ken livingstone , the mayor of london -lrb- picture -rrb- , told the bbc that the exercise would help save lives in the event of a terror attack .
however , he conceded , " we recognize if someone 's prepared to give their life in order to kill , it 's most probably impossible to stop them getting through .
our job is to put into place the things that minimize the loss of life when they do get through . " despite positive noises from the labor government on the success of the exercise , which it maintains had no relation to any specific threat on the capital , opposition ministers have warned that the uk still lags behind the level of response and competency of its counterparts in the united states in the event of a terrorist strike .
the london exercise came at the same time as u.s. emergency services staged a similar test on the benjamin franklin bridge between south jersey and philadelphia .
fire fighters and paramedics converged on the bridge in a simulation based on a terrorist hijacking of a high-speed train loaded with explosives that was intended for detonation at the delaware river crossing ’ s mid-way point .
extensive drills across the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 , 2001 .
the united states has carried out a number of exercises testing the response to further terror attacks since september 11 , 2001 including possible airborne strikes , simulated outbreaks of plague and the mock detonation of radioactive ‘ dirty ’ bombs which could spread contaminating material over a wide urban area .
however , the exercise in london was the first of its kind in a european capital .
the united kingdom was rated tenth on a ‘ league ’ table of most vulnerable countries in terms of terror attacks in a study conducted by the world markets research center -lrb- wmrc -rrb- .
it was the highest rated european country in terms of terrorist threats according to the study , due to its close relationship with the united states - ranked fourth - and its involvement in the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
those european countries that opposed the war in iraq , specifically france and germany were rated as much lower risks with france rated at 23rd and germany 41st .
if anything can be learned from the ‘ war on terror ’ , it must be that no country is immune from attack and that capital cities will always remain an attractive target for those wishing to strike at nations considered to be ‘ the enemy ’ .
terror alerts within europe have increased as the timeline continues to stretch away from september 11 , 2001 towards a new and possibly more spectacular and devastating attack , which experts consider to be “ inevitable . ”
and mounting evidence points to the possibility that next time , it could by a european city counting its dead .
bin laden threatens europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osama bin laden .
in november 2002 , a tape attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden threatened britain , germany , france and italy as well as canada and australia that “ you will be killed just as you killed and you will be bombed just as you bomb . "
the result being that officials across the continent and in germany and france in particular , issued statements warning the people of europe that they needed to be aware that the risk of a terror attack happening on european soil was both “ real and high . ”
just before last christmas , three muslim extremists were arrested in paris after investigations by french police led to the recovery of numerous chemicals in their apartment .
in early january , british police raided a london flat where four north african men were apprehended and charged with manufacturing the deadly toxin ricin .
it would appear that there is increasing justification for the high levels of alert in europe and the belief that it is only a matter of time before a european city is targeted .

but a spokesperson at the federal ministry of the interior told deutsche welle that the government has no concrete plans at the moment to carry out any " worst case scenario " catastrophe training in any major german city .
however , the german government has already taken steps in preperation of a possible nbc attack .
it has provided the 16 german states with a total of 367 state-of-the-art nuclear , biological and chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- detection vehicles .
these are the country 's first mobile response vehicles and would be called into action in the event of an attack to determine the threat .

it has also recently set up a new high-level agency , the federal office for civil protection and emergency response which will serve as the german government 's central organizational unit for civil security .

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .
" yet we can not let past differences interfere with present duties . "

just days after the leaders of france and germany dismissed a u.s.-backed u.n. resolution on iraq as inadequate , europe and america over the weekend appeared to be moving closer to a compromise . only last thursday , french president jacques chriac and german chancellor gerhard schröder rejected an american proposal for a new u.n. resolution on iraq , saying it did not give the united nations a “ dynamic enough ” role in rebuilding the country . but paris and berlin , both staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein , were keen not to shut the door entirely on washington , in the hope the united states might be willing to cede more control to the united nations . “ all of us have the desire to find a compromise , ” said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on saturday , while meeting his eu counterparts near lake garda in northern italy . washington , which has had difficultly stabilizing postwar iraq , would like a new resolution to pave the way for greater international involvement in peacekeeping operations and reconstruction efforts .
but u.s. president george bush has been loath to relinquish command of the iraqi occupation to the world body that once stymied his war efforts . fischer lauds u.s. initiative also in italy , german foreign minister joschka fischer lauded the united states ’ draft resolution for bringing “ movement ” into the discussion how to give the u.n. more responsibility in iraq .
he said he had spoken to u.s. secretary of state colin powell on friday and had listed changes berlin would like to see in the resolution before it could support it in the u.n. security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer . “ we want a transfer to an iraqi authority as soon as possible and a rebuilding of iraqi sovereignty in order to help achieve stability , ” said fischer . the current u.s. draft aims to create an u.n. multinational military force in iraq under american command .
it also would leave u.s. civil administrator paul bremer in charge of the occupation .
according to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , berlin realizes washington will be willing to offer the united nations only a certain degree of new authority .
citing high-ranking german officials , the paper said berlin remained confident a deal for a new resolution could be soon be struck . possible bush-schröder summit ? it was also reported over the weekend that bush was finally prepared to meet schröder or bilateral talks in new york later this month .
the two haven ’ t met one-on-one since bush became upset over schröder ’ s strong opposition to the war in iraq .
schröder is set to attend a meeting of the united nations general assembly from september 22 to 24 . somewhat ironically , the meeting between the two leaders could then take place exactly one year after schröder ’ s election victory that he largely owed to his anti-war stance .
schröder ’ s campaigning so angered bush that he refused to officially congratulate him on his reelection . a bush-schröder summit would signal a great thaw in u.s.-german relations , but it still seems unlikely bush will be able to convince schröder to send troops to iraq .
many observers consider the german army is already pushed to the breaking point with operations in afghanistan and elsewhere .
plus a military engagement in iraq would be unpopular with many germans , who feel their soldiers shouldn ’ t be placed in harm ’ s way for a conflict they didn ’ t want in the first place . speaking to german zdf television on saturday , schröder confirmed his well-known reluctance : “ we have no plans – and that ’ s the way it will stay – to get involved in iraq militarily . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush still , schröder is likely to face some pressure from bush .
during his first white house speech to be given since he announced the bombing of baghdad on march 19 , bush on sunday called for european countries to contribute both financially and militarily to the stabilization and rebuilding of iraq .
" europe , japan and states in the middle east all will benefit from the success of freedom in these two countries , and they should contribute to that success , " he said.he went on to describe military assistance from these countries as a " duty . "
" i recognize that not all our friends agreed with our decision to enforce the security council resolutions and remove saddam hussein from power , " he said .

for three weeks from monday , people will be given leaflets explaining the route and purpose of the link which will connect east and west london .
the pamphlets will have a tear-off returnable postcard on which commuters can comment on the plan .
this campaign is ahead of a major public consultation along the proposed route later in the autumn .
" crossrail will bring many benefits including simpler connections , improved access for all people and a better prospect of jobs and business opportunities for many years to come , " said cross london rail links chief executive norman haste .
" we need the public to play their part in helping to make a reality of easier and less-crowded travel across london , " he said .
crossrail proposal the scheme involves a central east-west tunnel with services extending to two branches to the east and two to the west .
this would involve a central tunnel from west of paddington to east of liverpool street from liverpool street , the line would extend through whitechapel , then dividing into two branches both serving the thames gateway - one going to stratford and joining the existing great eastern lines to shenfield the other will go down to the isle of dogs and the royal docks , crossing the thames to join the lines at abbey wood , with some services continuing to ebbsfleet in kent to the west of paddington , the line would join the great western main line before dividing into two further branches one would join up with the north london line , providing services to richmond and kingston the other would be via ealing and hayes to heathrow along the existing branch served by heathrow express shelved in the 1990s but now revived , the crossrail project has the support in principle of the government .
transport secretary alistair darling announced in july that he was " assembling an expert team to assess the proposals to ensure they offer good value to london and are deliverable " .
if it goes ahead crossrail would run from shenfield in essex through central london to heathrow in the west .
there is also a proposal for a crossrail line 2 , which would create a network of services linking clapham junction in south-west london to dalston in the north-east of the city .
crossrail could provide capacity for an extra 200 , 000 passengers during the morning rush hour and may also create up to 100,000 new jobs .
organisers hope that an application for the railway can be made to parliament from november 2004 , with construction starting in 2007 and trains operational by 2013 .
but mayor ken livingstone has said that he wants crossrail completed by 2012 , so that it can be a part of london 's bid for the 2012 olympic games .

the men , who worked for c and d industrial services , held an unofficial strike last week , but were told on friday they had lost their jobs .
the contract workers claimed their pay was less than that of workers in similar positions at the yard , despite some having been there for up to 20 years .
since 1990 , the contract workers claim their pay has only increased by £ 3.30 an hour .
union bosses had urged the men not to walk out .
but following an unofficial stoppage , the men were sacked .
on monday union leaders hope to persuade shipyard bosses to reverse their decision and enter into talks about pay .
a spokesman for the union amicus said the men still had its support .
he said : " we are hoping we can enter into some positive discussions with the company and with the men concerned .
the men are all time-served craftsmen and they were receiving £ 1.95 an hour less than the time served craftsmen who work directly for the yard .
" they were advised and they knew there was a possibility they could be dismissed if they staged an unofficial walkout .
" we are supporting them on the claim , but we can not condone the walkout . "

picking is due to begin this week - three weeks ahead of schedule .
tony skuriat , whose eglantine vineyard is close to loughborough , leicestershire , is attributing this to a rainy july followed by a hot august .
he said : " the wine will probably keep for longer and this is where the ' vintage years ' idea comes into being , because even in the south of france they do n't have a vintage year every year . "
" we 're not big enough to part company with part of the profits for the middleman " tony skuriat mr skuriat discovered his passion for wine production when he lived in west bridgford , nottinghamshire , working as a secondary school chemistry teacher .
he made the decision to find more suitable premises for wine-growing after his wife veronica pointed out their garden was becoming too crowded with vines for their children to have anywhere left to play .
they eventually started their vineyard on a plot halfway between the nottinghamshire villages of costock and bunny .
the eglantine vineyard 's first commercial crop appeared in 1984 - and in 2003 , clinched a silver medal in the international wine and spirits competition with its dessert wine north star .
like many of the 400 vineyard owners in england and wales , mr skuriat sells his produce straight from his premises .
he said : " we 're not big enough to part company with part of the profits for the middleman . "
despite this , he still manages to sell 4,000 bottles a year - and , with a bumper harvest expected , predicts he will be selling more than that in the future .

ysgol gyfun bryn tawe has been built on the site of the former penlan boys school which has undergone a £ 4m transformation .
it is the first new school in swansea for a decade and comes in response to the growing demand locally for welsh medium education - as in other parts of the country .
pupils will be drawn from a catchment area stretching from clydach in the swansea valley to langland in gower .
in common with other new schools ysgol gyfun bryn tawe will start with an intake of year 7 pupils alone . "
we hope that we do the local community and the whole of swansea proud . "
head teacher david williams initially , the school will have just 96 pupils and 11 teaching posts - for which 138 people applied .
funding for the school has come from both swansea council and the welsh assembly .
" the school is a credit to the enthusiasm from everyone who has fought for a second welsh medium school and swansea council and the assembly for responding to that , " said the school 's head teacher david williams .
" we hope that we do the local community and the whole of swansea proud . "
mother and toddlers in the new school , classrooms have been made 50 % bigger , new specialist teaching areas and laboratories have been created and each section of the school has a gallery for pupils work .
one of the key aims of the school is to promote the welsh language .
partnerships have already started with welsh youth organisations .
the regional officer of the youth movement , the urdd , is to have an office in the school and future initiatives include day and evening welsh lessons and a mothers ' and toddlers ' group .

thousands of chileans are paying tribute to the former socialist president , who died during the military coup of 11 september 1973 .

three senior party members representing different factions are challenging prime minister junichiro koizumi .
mr koizumi -lrb- centre -rrb- has disappointed on the economy the winning candidate automatically becomes prime minister .
mr koizumi , who won the position two-and-a-half years ago with promises of far-reaching reform , has been criticised for his failure to revive the japanese economy .
however , he retains more popular support than any other ldp candidate .
mr koizumi 's easy-going charisma has been on frequent display in recent weeks , from opening the pitching at a school baseball game , to visiting many of the country 's hard-pressed industries .
he needs to make the most of his popularity with the people , because many in his own party would like to see him unseated .
koizumi 's challengers shizuka kamei , 66 : former ldp policy chief ; favours revising pacifist constitution and more public spending masahiko komura , 61 : former foreign minister ; wants less austere fiscal stance takao fujii , 60 : former transport minister ; wants more public spending , but with better focus conservatives in the ldp are unhappy over his insistence on his own choice of ministers , not theirs , and his commitment to reforming japan 's business and political culture , even though he has failed to implement many of his bolder promises of change .
his opponents in the party argue that mr koizumi 's new , independent style of leadership has not delivered any real improvements to the depressed japanese economy .
as the prime minister is more popular with the rank-and-file of the party , he needs their support to win an overall majority in the first round of voting .
if he does not , he faces a run-off election against a single candidate in which only the members of parliament are allowed to vote .
however mr koizumi has two trump cards up his sleeve - the economy is now beginning to show signs of a real recovery , and he remains the only ldp candidate sufficiently popular with the public to ensure victory for the party at the next general election .

the bentley continental gt 's roaring engine , its sleek design , and its hand built wood-and-leather interior belies the car 's core task : to take this sumptuous brand downmarket .
a snip at £ 110,000 , the continental gt will be much cheaper than traditional bentleys when it goes on sale in its home market this month .
consequently , the car will be up against the likes of aston martin 's four seat db9 , due to be launched in frankfurt this week , and ferrari 's forthcoming four seat supercar , expected to be named 460 gt , rather than serious luxury cars like the maybach and rolls-royce .
if you go downmarket a little bit , of course the average wealth of the customers you talk to is a little less than the traditional customers dr franz-josef paefgen bentley motors chief executive the car is expected to do well .
four-wheel drive grip and acceleration to die for makes cruising along welsh mountain roads feel like a flight in an executive jet : smooth , comfortable , fast , exhilarating .
bargain brad wernle , who covers the car industry for automotive news europe , is impressed .
" i suppose the bentley -lsb- continental gt -rsb- looks like a bargain , " says mr wernle , bbc news online 's co-pilot during a test drive .
bentley 's chief executive , franz-josef paefgen , is keen to explain why .
" if you go downmarket a little bit , off course the average wealth of the customers you talk to is a little less than the traditional customers .
" this segment would have slightly younger - not young but younger - customers , and we also hope to talk to a lot more female potential customers with this car . "
bigger market bentley 's traditional customers are not only phenomenally wealthy .
mr tennant : " volkswagen is not doing this as a hobby " .
they are also scarce .
globally , there are only about 80,000 people with more than $ 20m-worth of net investable assets , according to cap gemini ernst & young 's world wealth report 2002 .
by comparison , there are as many as one-and-a-half million people who have net investable assets in excess of $ 3m .
it is this group that bentley sees as its new potential customers .
racing car but , acknowledges mark tennant , bentley 's director of marketing product strategy : selling cars to rich , successful 40-somethings is not a joking matter , at least not when your company is viewed as " very british , very conservative , very establishment " .
to get around such prejudices about the marque , bentley has decided to play the heritage card .
its marketing strategy is based on bentley 's past as a racing brand during the 1920s .
" we are going forward to our roots , " says dr paefgen cryptically , noting that bentley is back in the racing circuit , having won le mans earlier this summer .
strong demand and , looking ahead , the car is set to win a few hearts too .
during our drive across north wales , this four-seat grand tourer performed like a ferrari and turned even more heads .
even the hard-nosed motoring press is drooling over it , with car magazine screaming : " the bentley continental gt , friends , is a lot more than good .
it 's brilliant . "
so there is no surprise that demand for the car is strong .
" we already have a 12-month order book , " says mark tennant , bentley 's director of marketing product strategy .
volkswagen parts one reason for this could be the car 's relatively low price .
bentley , which is owned by the german automotive group volkswagen , has managed to curb costs from soaring by cherry picking parts from other luxury cars within the group .
" the car shares a number of underlying components with the volkswagen phaeton , so some of the cost is shared and not borne entirely by this car alone , " explains mr wernle .
" that makes it more economically feasible .
" in the current automotive environment , more companies are sharing their components , and the key is to do it in a clever way and preserve the integrity of the brand , which i feel bentley has done in this case . "
large potential indeed , the continental gt will be bentley 's first ever mass produced car - though the numbers churned out will remain very low when compared with true mass market vehicles .
dr paefgen : " we are going forward to our roots " .
next year , about 3,500 continentals will leave the bentley factory in crewe , cheshire .
but over time , this number is set to more than double .
" the total potential of the plant is as much as 9,000 per year , " says dr paefgen , referring to plans to produce a four-door version of the continental gt and possibly even a third version of the car in the years ahead .
and soon , these new bentleys should bring benefits for the parent company too .
" i can assure you that volkswagen is not doing this as a hobby .
it produces a very decent commercial return for them , " insists mr tennant .

polanski , who lives in france , was not at the academy awards in march because he could be arrested on child sex charges if he ever goes back to the us .
so the director was presented with the statuette by harrison ford at the deauville film festival in france .
polanski , who also made chinatown , fled the us in 1978 to escape sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl .
this was polanski 's first oscar after being nominated three times dating back to 1969 .
he is now chairing the jury of the deauville festival , in northern france , which celebrates american cinema .
ford , who starred in the director 's 1988 film frantic , was in town after his latest movie , hollywood homicide opened the event on friday .
polanski watched the oscars ceremony at the plaza hotel in paris with friends .
the pianist was based on the memoirs of wladyslaw szpilman , a polish jewish musician who survived nazi-occupied warsaw , but it also drew on the director 's own experiences .
the 70-year-old film-maker was born in france to jewish parents but returned to poland before world war ii .
his mother died in a concentration camp .
after the academy award win , he said : " i am deeply touched to have received the oscar for best director for a film which recounts events which are so close to my personal experience . "
he added that his experiences helped him " understand that art can transcend pain " .
the pianist also won oscars for best actor , for adrien brody , and best adapted screenplay .

the rifle grenade was found by a dutch metal detector enthusiast who was digging with a club close to norden station , near wareham , dorset .

a royal logistics corps army bomb disposal team from salisbury plain in wiltshire were called to the scene and destroyed the grenade just before 1330 bst .
police cordoned off the area swanage railway 's passenger services manager , david green , said they were able to keep all their trains running despite the operation .
mr green said : " everyone on the swanage railway acted with great professionalism in a cool and competent manner when the unexploded bomb was discovered .
" it 's not every day that you get an unexploded bomb on your doorstep and i am just glad that no-one was injured or killed and that the bomb disposal team was able to destroy it through a controlled explosion .
" it 's ironic that the day that this unexploded bomb was found was a day that we had provisionally chosen for holding a war on the line weekend , but the planned event had to be cancelled at an early stage for various reasons . "
