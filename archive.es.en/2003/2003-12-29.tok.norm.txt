five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .

while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2003 germany toys with new big brother technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video monitoring could become a reality on german roads .
while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .
" the existing criminal code isn ’ t enough for it , " schaar said in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" such measures are only allowed in individual cases where there ’ s a concrete suspicion of crime . "
although he said he " didn ’ t see an excessive violation " of citizens ’ rights if license plates , that weren ’ t on a " wanted criminal list , " were immediately erased , schaar added , " i still remain deeply skeptical of it .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.12.2003 german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now taking off from shanghai airport seven days a week three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .
future projects remain uncertain . three days ahead of schedule , the world ’ s first magnetic railway line took off with “ fairly crowded ” carriages , according to the chinese operating company .
no celebrations marked the occasion , however , as the maiden run had already happened on new year ’ s eve 2002 , with german chancellor gerhard schröder and then chinese premier zhu rongji on board . since then , about half a million passengers have used the $ 1 billion -lrb- € 800 million -rrb- rail link during its technologically troubled test phase for the eight minute , 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- ride from shanghai ’ s airport to the city ’ s financial district .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right , and thyssenkrupp ceo ekkehard schulz travelled by shanghai transrapid last september . the trains , which have reached record speeds of 501 kilometers per hour , will now run during weekday mornings and all day on weekends .
by 2005 , transrapid is expected to carry 10 million passengers per year . a chinese showcase for german technology the german transrapid consortium , which is made up of thyssenkrupp and siemens , hailed monday ’ s start of regular operations as a breakthrough for the magnetic railway technology made in germany .
critics have argued , however , that transrapid is an expensive waste of energy as conventional high-speed trains can almost match its speed . transrapid 's chinese customers have also begun to wonder why the system still does n't exist in the country of its conception .
earlier this year , the government of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia scrapped a € 3.2 billion project to build a tranrapid line between düsseldorf and dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid has been running on a test line in northwestern germany , but it 's still unclear whether an actual railway link will ever be built in the country .
“ why don ’ t you build the transrapid in germany , ” asked liang baohua , the governor of jiangsu province , where officials are thinking about ordering the system as well .
while the consortium has abandoned efforts to win the concession for a 1,300 kilometer link from shanghai to beijing , it still hopes to build shorter routes from shanghai to hangzou -lrb- 180 kilometers -rrb- or nanjing -lrb- 300 kilometers -rrb- . munich transrapid in 2010 ? to appease chinese concerns over germany ’ s failure to introduce the system at home , transrapid makers are now setting their hopes on a project connecting munich and its airport and announced a potential starting date of 2010 on monday .
financing of the € 1.6 billion railway link is still uncertain , however . the consortium could make good use of the munich contract as its german factory is running out of work : while 600 people were employed there at the high point of production , the company announced in early december that most of its employees would have to work reduced hours because of a lack of demand . transferring technology and work to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in shanghai , chinese workers have so far only helped to unload transrapid carriages , but they are likely to build them for future lines .
while the shanghai transrapid carriages were still produced in germany , future ones are likely to be made by chinese workers : as the largest potential market for magnetic railway lines , china is calling for a transfer of the technology to build transrapid at home . while describing this as an inevitable step , siemens ceo heinrich von pierer has said that some jobs would still remain in germany . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder christens first transrapid line with tuesday 's successful inauguration of germany 's transrapid train technology , the world 's speediest , in shanghai , chancellor gerhard schröder gets his first good economic news of the year .

while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .

data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .

while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .

learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .

however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”
its counterpart , with the name of the donor on it , will be kept in the library . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration feedback which book one would you consider a must-read for polar researchers living in near-isolation ? 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.12.2003 german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now taking off from shanghai airport seven days a week three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .
future projects remain uncertain . three days ahead of schedule , the world ’ s first magnetic railway line took off with “ fairly crowded ” carriages , according to the chinese operating company .
no celebrations marked the occasion , however , as the maiden run had already happened on new year ’ s eve 2002 , with german chancellor gerhard schröder and then chinese premier zhu rongji on board . since then , about half a million passengers have used the $ 1 billion -lrb- € 800 million -rrb- rail link during its technologically troubled test phase for the eight minute , 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- ride from shanghai ’ s airport to the city ’ s financial district .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right , and thyssenkrupp ceo ekkehard schulz travelled by shanghai transrapid last september . the trains , which have reached record speeds of 501 kilometers per hour , will now run during weekday mornings and all day on weekends .
by 2005 , transrapid is expected to carry 10 million passengers per year . a chinese showcase for german technology the german transrapid consortium , which is made up of thyssenkrupp and siemens , hailed monday ’ s start of regular operations as a breakthrough for the magnetic railway technology made in germany .
critics have argued , however , that transrapid is an expensive waste of energy as conventional high-speed trains can almost match its speed . transrapid 's chinese customers have also begun to wonder why the system still does n't exist in the country of its conception .
earlier this year , the government of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia scrapped a € 3.2 billion project to build a tranrapid line between düsseldorf and dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid has been running on a test line in northwestern germany , but it 's still unclear whether an actual railway link will ever be built in the country .
“ why don ’ t you build the transrapid in germany , ” asked liang baohua , the governor of jiangsu province , where officials are thinking about ordering the system as well .
while the consortium has abandoned efforts to win the concession for a 1,300 kilometer link from shanghai to beijing , it still hopes to build shorter routes from shanghai to hangzou -lrb- 180 kilometers -rrb- or nanjing -lrb- 300 kilometers -rrb- . munich transrapid in 2010 ? to appease chinese concerns over germany ’ s failure to introduce the system at home , transrapid makers are now setting their hopes on a project connecting munich and its airport and announced a potential starting date of 2010 on monday .
financing of the € 1.6 billion railway link is still uncertain , however . the consortium could make good use of the munich contract as its german factory is running out of work : while 600 people were employed there at the high point of production , the company announced in early december that most of its employees would have to work reduced hours because of a lack of demand . transferring technology and work to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in shanghai , chinese workers have so far only helped to unload transrapid carriages , but they are likely to build them for future lines .
while the shanghai transrapid carriages were still produced in germany , future ones are likely to be made by chinese workers : as the largest potential market for magnetic railway lines , china is calling for a transfer of the technology to build transrapid at home . while describing this as an inevitable step , siemens ceo heinrich von pierer has said that some jobs would still remain in germany . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder christens first transrapid line with tuesday 's successful inauguration of germany 's transrapid train technology , the world 's speediest , in shanghai , chancellor gerhard schröder gets his first good economic news of the year .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

future projects remain uncertain . three days ahead of schedule , the world ’ s first magnetic railway line took off with “ fairly crowded ” carriages , according to the chinese operating company .
no celebrations marked the occasion , however , as the maiden run had already happened on new year ’ s eve 2002 , with german chancellor gerhard schröder and then chinese premier zhu rongji on board . since then , about half a million passengers have used the $ 1 billion -lrb- € 800 million -rrb- rail link during its technologically troubled test phase for the eight minute , 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- ride from shanghai ’ s airport to the city ’ s financial district .

critics have argued , however , that transrapid is an expensive waste of energy as conventional high-speed trains can almost match its speed . transrapid 's chinese customers have also begun to wonder why the system still does n't exist in the country of its conception .

“ why don ’ t you build the transrapid in germany , ” asked liang baohua , the governor of jiangsu province , where officials are thinking about ordering the system as well .
while the consortium has abandoned efforts to win the concession for a 1,300 kilometer link from shanghai to beijing , it still hopes to build shorter routes from shanghai to hangzou -lrb- 180 kilometers -rrb- or nanjing -lrb- 300 kilometers -rrb- . munich transrapid in 2010 ? to appease chinese concerns over germany ’ s failure to introduce the system at home , transrapid makers are now setting their hopes on a project connecting munich and its airport and announced a potential starting date of 2010 on monday .

while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .
" the existing criminal code isn ’ t enough for it , " schaar said in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" such measures are only allowed in individual cases where there ’ s a concrete suspicion of crime . "

while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”
its counterpart , with the name of the donor on it , will be kept in the library . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration feedback which book one would you consider a must-read for polar researchers living in near-isolation ? 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2003 european scientists still hopeful about finding lost beagle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists all over the world have joined the search for the missing beagle .
five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .

learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .

however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .

close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.12.2003 german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now taking off from shanghai airport seven days a week three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .
future projects remain uncertain . three days ahead of schedule , the world ’ s first magnetic railway line took off with “ fairly crowded ” carriages , according to the chinese operating company .
no celebrations marked the occasion , however , as the maiden run had already happened on new year ’ s eve 2002 , with german chancellor gerhard schröder and then chinese premier zhu rongji on board . since then , about half a million passengers have used the $ 1 billion -lrb- € 800 million -rrb- rail link during its technologically troubled test phase for the eight minute , 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- ride from shanghai ’ s airport to the city ’ s financial district .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right , and thyssenkrupp ceo ekkehard schulz travelled by shanghai transrapid last september . the trains , which have reached record speeds of 501 kilometers per hour , will now run during weekday mornings and all day on weekends .
by 2005 , transrapid is expected to carry 10 million passengers per year . a chinese showcase for german technology the german transrapid consortium , which is made up of thyssenkrupp and siemens , hailed monday ’ s start of regular operations as a breakthrough for the magnetic railway technology made in germany .
critics have argued , however , that transrapid is an expensive waste of energy as conventional high-speed trains can almost match its speed . transrapid 's chinese customers have also begun to wonder why the system still does n't exist in the country of its conception .
earlier this year , the government of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia scrapped a € 3.2 billion project to build a tranrapid line between düsseldorf and dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid has been running on a test line in northwestern germany , but it 's still unclear whether an actual railway link will ever be built in the country .
“ why don ’ t you build the transrapid in germany , ” asked liang baohua , the governor of jiangsu province , where officials are thinking about ordering the system as well .

financing of the € 1.6 billion railway link is still uncertain , however . the consortium could make good use of the munich contract as its german factory is running out of work : while 600 people were employed there at the high point of production , the company announced in early december that most of its employees would have to work reduced hours because of a lack of demand . transferring technology and work to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in shanghai , chinese workers have so far only helped to unload transrapid carriages , but they are likely to build them for future lines .
while the shanghai transrapid carriages were still produced in germany , future ones are likely to be made by chinese workers : as the largest potential market for magnetic railway lines , china is calling for a transfer of the technology to build transrapid at home . while describing this as an inevitable step , siemens ceo heinrich von pierer has said that some jobs would still remain in germany . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder christens first transrapid line with tuesday 's successful inauguration of germany 's transrapid train technology , the world 's speediest , in shanghai , chancellor gerhard schröder gets his first good economic news of the year .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”
its counterpart , with the name of the donor on it , will be kept in the library . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration feedback which book one would you consider a must-read for polar researchers living in near-isolation ? 9798 dw-tv europe live global 3000 we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2003 european scientists still hopeful about finding lost beagle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists all over the world have joined the search for the missing beagle .
five days after it should have landed on the surface of mars , all attempts have failed to track a signal from beagle 2 , the european space agency ’ s first mars lander . though esa 's five-day , space manhunt for beagle 2 , involving massive radio telescopes in england and the united states , has failed to detect a signal , scientists are n't giving up hope . they say their best chance of tracking the small probe will come after jan .
4 , when the mars express spacecraft enters into an orbit that will bring it within 200-250 kilometers of the planet ’ s surface .
mars express is the only craft that has been designed specifically to communicate with the beagle 2 , providing the best chance of establishing contact with the stray probe .
but first , mars express has to be moved from its higher orbit around the equator to a lower polar orbit - a maneuver that will require the firing of its engine on dec .
30 .
" these key maneuvers will allow us to get even closer to mars , " said michael mckay , esa ’ s mars express flight director .
" they will not only allow us more frequent ‘ overflights ’ of the beagle 2 landing area , but also ensure the beginning of the orbiter ’ s science mission .
as mars express is the planned main communication partner of beagle 2 , the chances of obtaining a signal strongly increase . "
listening for a pulse the team of scientists behind the beagle aren ’ t fretting just yet .
they ’ ve also deployed massive telescopes around the world to trace beagle ’ s signal , including an extremely powerful radio telescope at california ’ s stanford university that is capable of detecting radio emissions from the lander ’ s microchip .
but sifting through the volume of data the telescope delivers will take weeks , like finding a needle in a haystack .
" we haven ’ t yet played all our cards , " said david southwood , the space agency ’ s director of science .
" with mars express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand .
at the moment , i am frustrated rather than concerned . "
once mars express enters into polar orbit , its high-resolution stereo camera can take close-up shots with enough detail to identify the lander ’ s parachutes and gas bags on the martian surface .
beagle 2 is also supposed to increase its radio signals around the time mars express enters into the correct orbit .
" we need to get beagle 2 into a period when it can broadcast for a much longer period , " said colin pillinger , the scientist at britain ’ s open university who created the lander .
" this will happen around jan .
4 after the spacecraft has experienced a sufficient number of communication failures to switch to automatic transmission mode . "
' tiger team ' probes worst-case scenarios meanwhile , scientists in britain have put together a " tiger team " at the british national space center to run through different problem scenarios on a functioning mock-up of the lander to see if and how they can be solved .
" we 've pulled out a number of specialists into a think-tank , " said alan wells , a beagle team scientist .
" these guys are looking at what information we 're getting so far from the contact attempts , analyzing that data and looking at recovery options we can pursue .
what we 're doing is looking at any possibility where beagle 2 is still functioning and we 're not able to communicate with it for some reason . "
scientists initially thought the clock might have damaged as it hurdled through the martian atmosphere , but they have now abandoned that theory in favor of new possibilities .
the first is that beagle may have landed in a canyon , and that its position is obscuring the lander 's signal .
a software glitch in beagle 's clock could be causing it to transmit its signal at the wrong times so that telescopes on earth miss picking it up .
another theory is that the beagle 's oyster-like shell has failed to unfold .
and although the european space agency hasn ’ t given up on the beagle yet , scientists in europe have begun to broach the possibility that it didn ’ t survive the landing .
" we ’ ve always recognized that beagle 2 was a high-risk project , " said lord sainsbury , britain ’ s science minister .
" we must in the future resist the temptation only to do low-risk projects .
long term , we need to be working with the european space agency to ensure that in some form there is a beagle 3 . "
but before any plans for beagle 3 can be laid on the table , scientists need to find out what happened to beagle 2 . esa ’ s southwood is still optimistic the spacecraft can be found .
" i certainly have n't written beagle off , none of the team has , " he said .
" we believe beagle is on the surface and the mother , mars express , is very anxious to get in touch with her baby again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2003 germany toys with new big brother technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video monitoring could become a reality on german roads .
while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .
" the existing criminal code isn ’ t enough for it , " schaar said in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" such measures are only allowed in individual cases where there ’ s a concrete suspicion of crime . "
although he said he " didn ’ t see an excessive violation " of citizens ’ rights if license plates , that weren ’ t on a " wanted criminal list , " were immediately erased , schaar added , " i still remain deeply skeptical of it .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.12.2003 german transrapid runs on schedule in shanghai großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now taking off from shanghai airport seven days a week three decades after germans began working on a magnetic railway and three years after china ordered the system as shanghai ’ s airport connection , trains began regular operations monday .
future projects remain uncertain . three days ahead of schedule , the world ’ s first magnetic railway line took off with “ fairly crowded ” carriages , according to the chinese operating company .
no celebrations marked the occasion , however , as the maiden run had already happened on new year ’ s eve 2002 , with german chancellor gerhard schröder and then chinese premier zhu rongji on board . since then , about half a million passengers have used the $ 1 billion -lrb- € 800 million -rrb- rail link during its technologically troubled test phase for the eight minute , 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- ride from shanghai ’ s airport to the city ’ s financial district .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right , and thyssenkrupp ceo ekkehard schulz travelled by shanghai transrapid last september . the trains , which have reached record speeds of 501 kilometers per hour , will now run during weekday mornings and all day on weekends .
by 2005 , transrapid is expected to carry 10 million passengers per year . a chinese showcase for german technology the german transrapid consortium , which is made up of thyssenkrupp and siemens , hailed monday ’ s start of regular operations as a breakthrough for the magnetic railway technology made in germany .
critics have argued , however , that transrapid is an expensive waste of energy as conventional high-speed trains can almost match its speed . transrapid 's chinese customers have also begun to wonder why the system still does n't exist in the country of its conception .
earlier this year , the government of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia scrapped a € 3.2 billion project to build a tranrapid line between düsseldorf and dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid has been running on a test line in northwestern germany , but it 's still unclear whether an actual railway link will ever be built in the country .
“ why don ’ t you build the transrapid in germany , ” asked liang baohua , the governor of jiangsu province , where officials are thinking about ordering the system as well .
while the consortium has abandoned efforts to win the concession for a 1,300 kilometer link from shanghai to beijing , it still hopes to build shorter routes from shanghai to hangzou -lrb- 180 kilometers -rrb- or nanjing -lrb- 300 kilometers -rrb- . munich transrapid in 2010 ? to appease chinese concerns over germany ’ s failure to introduce the system at home , transrapid makers are now setting their hopes on a project connecting munich and its airport and announced a potential starting date of 2010 on monday .
financing of the € 1.6 billion railway link is still uncertain , however . the consortium could make good use of the munich contract as its german factory is running out of work : while 600 people were employed there at the high point of production , the company announced in early december that most of its employees would have to work reduced hours because of a lack of demand . transferring technology and work to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in shanghai , chinese workers have so far only helped to unload transrapid carriages , but they are likely to build them for future lines .
while the shanghai transrapid carriages were still produced in germany , future ones are likely to be made by chinese workers : as the largest potential market for magnetic railway lines , china is calling for a transfer of the technology to build transrapid at home . while describing this as an inevitable step , siemens ceo heinrich von pierer has said that some jobs would still remain in germany . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder christens first transrapid line with tuesday 's successful inauguration of germany 's transrapid train technology , the world 's speediest , in shanghai , chancellor gerhard schröder gets his first good economic news of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2003 germany toys with new big brother technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video monitoring could become a reality on german roads .
while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .
" the existing criminal code isn ’ t enough for it , " schaar said in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" such measures are only allowed in individual cases where there ’ s a concrete suspicion of crime . "
although he said he " didn ’ t see an excessive violation " of citizens ’ rights if license plates , that weren ’ t on a " wanted criminal list , " were immediately erased , schaar added , " i still remain deeply skeptical of it .

future projects remain uncertain . three days ahead of schedule , the world ’ s first magnetic railway line took off with “ fairly crowded ” carriages , according to the chinese operating company .
no celebrations marked the occasion , however , as the maiden run had already happened on new year ’ s eve 2002 , with german chancellor gerhard schröder and then chinese premier zhu rongji on board . since then , about half a million passengers have used the $ 1 billion -lrb- € 800 million -rrb- rail link during its technologically troubled test phase for the eight minute , 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- ride from shanghai ’ s airport to the city ’ s financial district .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right , and thyssenkrupp ceo ekkehard schulz travelled by shanghai transrapid last september . the trains , which have reached record speeds of 501 kilometers per hour , will now run during weekday mornings and all day on weekends .
by 2005 , transrapid is expected to carry 10 million passengers per year . a chinese showcase for german technology the german transrapid consortium , which is made up of thyssenkrupp and siemens , hailed monday ’ s start of regular operations as a breakthrough for the magnetic railway technology made in germany .
critics have argued , however , that transrapid is an expensive waste of energy as conventional high-speed trains can almost match its speed . transrapid 's chinese customers have also begun to wonder why the system still does n't exist in the country of its conception .
earlier this year , the government of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia scrapped a € 3.2 billion project to build a tranrapid line between düsseldorf and dortmund . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid has been running on a test line in northwestern germany , but it 's still unclear whether an actual railway link will ever be built in the country .
“ why don ’ t you build the transrapid in germany , ” asked liang baohua , the governor of jiangsu province , where officials are thinking about ordering the system as well .
while the consortium has abandoned efforts to win the concession for a 1,300 kilometer link from shanghai to beijing , it still hopes to build shorter routes from shanghai to hangzou -lrb- 180 kilometers -rrb- or nanjing -lrb- 300 kilometers -rrb- . munich transrapid in 2010 ? to appease chinese concerns over germany ’ s failure to introduce the system at home , transrapid makers are now setting their hopes on a project connecting munich and its airport and announced a potential starting date of 2010 on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2003 germany toys with new big brother technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video monitoring could become a reality on german roads .
while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .
" the existing criminal code isn ’ t enough for it , " schaar said in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" such measures are only allowed in individual cases where there ’ s a concrete suspicion of crime . "

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”

german rescue specialists are trained to react swiftly to natural disasters such as earthquake and offer expertise on the ground .
the “ academy for crisis management ” has experience in dealing with the worst . barely 24 hours after a massive earthquake flattened the city of bam in southeastern iran , 30 earthquake specialists from germany ’ s federal relief organization -lrb- thw -rrb- were on a plane bound for the crisis zone .
equipped with sniffer dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other hi-tech tools , the team set about looking for survivors trapped under tons of fallen debris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the earthquake in bam they were assisted by workers from other aid organizations such as the german red cross , who flew in with almost 33 tons of medicine , tents , blankets , jackets and water-purification plants .
coordinated by the foreign ministry in berlin , the massive german search and rescue operation in iran which involved nearly 70 specialists , was up and running within hours of the teams ’ arrival in bam .
learning to cope with crisis the speed and the efficiency of the aid operation could be pinned to the germans ’ fabled skills for organization and precision .
but the main reason behind saturday ’ s well-executed rescue maneuver lies in the town of ahrweiler , near the city of bonn .
there , in a former german army base , lies germany ’ s " academy of crisis management , emergency planning and civilian protection . "
as the name suggests , the institution trains heads of various aid and relief organizations in dealing with natural and man-made catastrophes such as earthquakes , floods , terror attacks and war .
the academy offers around 400 seminars a year as well as advanced training for all those who need to organize professional help in the event of crisis .
that includes police , fire-fighters , soldiers and civilian employees and ministry staff , who , for instance , are responsible for providing electricity and drinking water .
learning to think fast with the help of invented horror scenarios , participants in the academy ’ s seminars learn how to think and react quickly to a number of different crisis situations .
during a recent course on flood management , for example , a class comprised of heads of various private aid agencies and federal emergency services discussed the best way to achieve a coordinated and smooth relief effort involving the fire engine department , the thw and non-governmental aid organizations .
one of the participants , rainer blumrath , who works for the fire department and attends several courses at the academy on " heading technical deployments , " told dw-radio that the seminars and courses were especially important for meeting colleagues from other german states and swapping experiences that could provide important insights .
coordination the key dietrich läpke , head of the " academy for crisis management " underscored coordination as the all-important factor when it comes to reacting to disaster , particularly since the borders between protecting the civilian population and providing disaster relief had become increasingly blurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german solider helps a woman out of the water during floods in eastern germany last year .
in germany , the two fields are divided among the federal government and the 16 federal states : while the government is expected to protect citizens if a war breaks out , the states are responsible for handling natural catastrophes .
however , recent experience , such as last year ’ s floods in eastern germany -lrb- photo -rrb- , have shown that such deployments can rarely be carried out alone .
" protecting civilians and providing disaster relief will change further and become more international in the future , " läpke said .
" the academy expects further work in this regard because natural catastrophes seldom let national state borders stop them . "
close cooperation between army and aid agencies frank jörres , a member of the german red cross , also stressed that the army and aid organizations need to work closely together when disaster strikes and emphasized it was important that both sectors know the other ’ s working methods and functions .
jörres offers preparatory seminars at the academy on the cooperation between civilian and military organizations abroad .
subject matter usually includes the work of the united nations , its special affiliated organizations and aid programs .
in addition , participants learn how aid organizations like the international committee of the red cross fulfill their tough mandate or how the european commission finances such efforts . sandra ketterer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes for finding survivors fade in iran with aid from relief organizations around the world , the iranian city of bam is slowly piecing itself back together .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”
its counterpart , with the name of the donor on it , will be kept in the library . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration feedback which book one would you consider a must-read for polar researchers living in near-isolation ? dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

german artist lutz fritsch wants to install one amid the bleak beauty of a research station in the weddell sea . in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet , a handful of climatologists examine centuries-old ice for clues about the weather in eras long past .
here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”

here , between neon tubes and measuring devices , there would seem to be no place for art and literature . yet that ’ s exactly what german sculptor and artist lutz fritsch wants to create : a “ library in the ice , ” an archive of human achievements in contrast to nature at its most extreme . party of ten the neumayer scientific research station , run by germany ’ s alfred-wegener-institute for polar exploration , houses up to ten people who live and work there during the antarctic winter .
each team overwintering at the station stays there for 14 to 15 months , and for nine months of that time , their only link to the outside world is by radio or satellite . during the winter of 1994/95 , fritsch travelled to neumayer aboard the research ship polar star , spending a number of weeks with the scientists .
the artist says the idea for the library came from experiencing the vastness of the landscape compared to the closeness of the living quarters , which consist of adjoining corrugated metal containers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the library should be “ the opposite of the sobriety of the research station , ” says fritsch , a “ place in the ice in which to ruminate about the fast , hectic world back home . ” the library will also be housed in a corrugated metal container ; the idea of a specially made , glassed-walled building was nixed due to cost considerations .
but while similarly isolated from the bitter cold , it is nonetheless different from its weatherbeaten counterparts . cherry wood and leather painted bright green with a pink roof , the library is designed to stand out on the antarctic ice shelf like a colorful building block , offering strong contrast to its monotonous surroundings .
the cozy interior invites guests to sit down and stay a while : bookshelves of cherry wood and a brown leather sofa exude warmth and comfort .
a small window over the reading table looks out onto a view of endless ice desert and an empty horizon . fritsch aims to use the library to create a dialog between art and science , connecting artists and thinkers from various disciplines together .
he has asked hundreds of individual artists and scientists to each donate the one book that they think the polar researchers absolutely must read during their 15-month stay at neumayer , something that applies to their particularly isolated situation .
each book is signed by the person who recommended it , and comes with a commentary as to why it was selected . thus far , fritsch has collected some 500 books , from writers such as günter grass and christa wolf , and film director tom tykwer ; he hopes eventually to have between 1,000 and 1,500 .
günter grass chose his novel my century , while filmmaker tom tykwer chose danish author peter hoeg ’ s novel borderliners , a rumination on the limitations of time and space . fundraising bookends the library container was delivered to the antarctic in early december , and the books should follow sometime in 2004 .
the project is supported in part by the alfred wegener institute , who provided the container and transport .
fritsch hopes to pay for the interior decoration and other costs through special edition aluminum bookends . for 1,000 euros , a buyer can get a bookend engraved with the words “ library in the ice . ”

while germany ’ s toll system for heavy trucks flounders , a new big brother for the country ’ s roads is already in the planning : a surveillance system of cameras installed at important traffic junctions to track criminals . german security experts are experimenting with a new tool that might facilitate their work in hunting down wanted criminals and car thieves .
a security concept , presented at the conference of german interior ministers this past summer and kept under wraps until recently leaked to the press , details how surveillance technology could help monitor germany ’ s roads by scanning the license plates of all cars driving by .
the information would be processed and fed into a specially-designed computer that would compare the information with the central criminal database at the federal investigation agency -lrb- bka -rrb- in wiesbaden and thus help trace stolen cars and wanted criminals .
security experts from germany ’ s 16 states as well as from the federal government are said to have shown interest in the new technology .
a few states such as bavaria and hesse are allegedly already working on implementing the concept within their state security structures and even experts at the german border protection force are reported to be confident that the new technology would assist in the search for criminals .
the nuts and bolts the monitoring technology is fairly simple .
video cameras installed at central traffic intersections , in tunnels and on the highways all over germany would permanently film the license plates of all cars driving by .
the images are then digitalized for the computer to read the license numbers .
the computer would be programmed to issue an alarm when it finds a match between one of the cars ’ license numbers and that of one listed in the central criminal database .
it then indicates if a number plate is forged , a car is registered as " stolen " or if the car driver is on a " wanted list . "
a police patrol would then just need to follow the offender and stop the car .
successful precedents to go by the new hi-tech security technology coincides with the german government ’ s much-touted plans to roll out a new toll collecting system on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles .
the system , the world ’ s first to use satellite technology to record highway mileage logged by trucks and charge fares automatically , however , has run into embarrassing technical and financial glitches , thus delaying the launch by a whole year .
but unlike the state of the art toll collect system , experts have ample proof that the new monitoring technology works .
in london , all entry and exit points in the city are scrutinized with the help of video cameras within the framework of the new traffic congestion fee .
hamburg police chief udo nagel , who paid a visit to the metropolitan police in london in early november told news magazine spiegel that the result was " very convincing . "
he said his counterparts in london didn ’ t miss a single suspicious vehicle thanks to the new technology .
in italy the monitoring system is currently in use , and in switzerland authorities deployed the technology in 2001 .
a video camera monitors the sihlquai street in central zurich and scans around 10,000 license plates a day .
data security a controversial issue despite the proven efficiency of the monitoring system , it still remains unclear when the new technology will be installed in germany .
an overriding problem remains the question of data privacy laws , an issue that all legislative assemblies in germany ’ s 16 federal states will have to grapple with before giving the go-ahead for the technology .
though germany ’ s criminal code generally allows the use of technology for hunting down criminals and in so-called danger prevention measures such as the observation of terror suspects , the blanket monitoring that the new technology entails remains a controversial issue as normal citizens would also be scanned by the cameras .
federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar said he didn ’ t believe the new security plans had a sufficient legal basis .
" the existing criminal code isn ’ t enough for it , " schaar said in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" such measures are only allowed in individual cases where there ’ s a concrete suspicion of crime . "
although he said he " didn ’ t see an excessive violation " of citizens ’ rights if license plates , that weren ’ t on a " wanted criminal list , " were immediately erased , schaar added , " i still remain deeply skeptical of it .

but his opponent alvaro colom has refused to concede defeat yet , hoping for a late rally .
with almost all the ballots counted , mr berger , 57 , a conservative former mayor of guatemala city , is said to have an unassailable lead over mr colom , 52 .
it is the second presidential election since a peace deal ended guatemala 's 36-year civil war in 1996 .
light voting mr berger declared himself the winner with results showing him leading mr colom 56 % to 44 % with 70 % of votes counted .
the election commission said preliminary tallies could change a great deal , but the bbc 's greg morsbach says mr berger 's win is expected to be confirmed .
international election observers visiting guatemala said the turnout had been lower than expected .
but they added that the election passed off peacefully without the violence and intimidation seen in november 's first round when 58 % of voters went to the polls .
security had been tight amid fears that supporters of the former military ruler , general efrain rios montt , would again take to the streets to hamper the election process after their candidate was defeated in the first round .
our correspondent says one of the first challenges mr berger will have to face is to decide what to do about the former dictator .
many guatemalans are demanding that the general be brought to justice for alleged crimes , such as corruption and murder , committed during his presidency in the early 1980s .
mr colom , who called himself the " candidate of the poor " , had vowed to bring mr rios montt to justice for the alleged killing of hundreds of civilians during his rule in the early 1980s .
the former military ruler loses his parliamentary immunity from prosecution on 14 january , when he has to give up his seat as a member of guatemala 's congress .
mr berger lost to the current president , alfonso portillo , in 1999 .
but after a landslide victory five years ago , president portillo has been accused of corruption and has seen his party lose ground in congress .

mr pugh has warned that wales is one of the least active countries in europe and that exercise habits must change to prevent a future explosion of obesity-related illnesses swamping the welsh nhs .
mr pugh claims that wales is one of the most unhealthy nations in europe and the lack of exercise taken by a large section of the welsh population is a " potential timebomb " underneath the nhs .
according to research , fewer than 30 % of welsh people take any exercise .
mr pugh was speaking ahead of a sport and exercise summit with health experts , which is due to take place next month .
we must tackle bad habits early on dr simon fradd mr pugh said that the nhs in wales could be " overwhelmed by a tidal wave of obesity driven by sickness " .
he added : " only 28 % of our adult population take exercise , obesity levels are growing to epidemic levels and obesity is a significant cause of diabetes , cancer and heart disease .
" this is a potential timebomb under our health service .
" the costs of inactivity in wales are around £ 100m a year , and are set to grow .
" wales is one of the least active parts of the whole of europe .
there are warnings that obesity levels are rising in wales " we are even less active that the english - let alone healthy nations such as finland . "
dr simon fradd is chairman of developing patient partnerships which has published a survey into the attitudes of 11 to 15 year olds towards obesity .
he said two thirds of this age group said they did care about their weight and wanted to know how to control it , but at the same time obesity had " doubled in 10 years in this group . "
" this raises questions about the development of diabetes and other diseases , " he said .
" i really do think we have to grapple with health education for young people so they know about healthy lifestyles in general .
" you ca n't just change things with leaflets it needs to change from the cradle . "

air marshals are due to start flying on routes to the us this week in a move which has been attacked by british pilots .
mr learmont , of flight international magazine , said if would-be hijackers were able to get a gun on board , it would be a handgun .
" you could n't get a kalashnikov on board , it 's so big that even the doziest guy on the x-ray machine in the airport would see that being got on board .
so we 're talking handguns . "
he said that all flights into america had re-enforced bullet proof cockpit doors which stay locked during the flight .
we do n't want gun fight at the ok corral going on in the back of our aircraft david learmont " nobody can get into the cockpit and take the aircraft over so all that can happen , and this is the worst , is that one person with one handgun can get on board and threaten one passenger , " he told bbc news .
" by the time that he might have harmed that passenger he 'll be under a heap of other passengers just like the shoe bomber was a year ago .
" when people see suspicious things happening on an aircraft the passengers are no longer passive . "
he said the strong cockpit doors were the reason the airlines and the international air transport association , the trade association of all the world 's airlines , were opposed to introducing air marshals .
" the reaction of the pilots ' union , has been we do n't want more guns on board an aircraft .
" if somebody does manage to smuggle a handgun on board , we do n't want gun fight at the ok corral going on in the back of our aircraft . "
deterrent he continued : " so you do n't need security guards on board any longer - at least not ones that are armed with firearms .
" that just increases the danger to the passengers on board and this , i think , is the pointless aspect that both the pilots and the airlines are talking about . "
mr learmont said he believed the government was a " political statement " which would fail to reassure passengers .
however he said he thought it might deter would-be hijackers .
" if it has a deterrent effect then it has n't been an entire waste of time . "

the study in the journal cancer by an international researchers analysed data on more than 17,000 patients .
the five year survival rate in the us was 89 % compared to 79 % in europe .
however , 41 % of the us cases were diagnosed at an early stage , compared to just 29 % in europe .
early treatment of breast cancer greatly improves survival rates as the disease can be treated before it has the chance to spread to other parts of the body .
the team also found that a greater proportion of elderly women than young women in the us were diagnosed at an early stage - 43 % of over-65s compared to 38 % of younger women .
the situation was reversed in europe , with early-stage tumours more commonly diagnosed in younger female sufferers - 31 % of under-65s compared to 25 % of older women .
better screening the research suggests that screening programmes and awareness of the signs of breast cancer among women are better in the us , allowing tumours to be picked up at an earlier stage .
it could also be that there is less of a delay between a woman visiting her doctor with suspicions of a breast lump and a diagnosis being made .

first staged in 1931 , eugene o 'neill 's play is a heady mix of familial intrigue , freudian psychodrama and greek tragedy that leaves the audience both exhilarated and exhausted .
dame helen is on superb form as the new england matriarch who murders her husband in league with her younger lover .
but her performance is matched by that of relative newcomer eve best as the vengeful daughter who exacts bloody retribution .
body count clocking in at four-and-a-half hours , this terrific revival lasts the length of two prime suspects and has a body count to match .
the setting is america at the end of its civil war , but the inspiration lies even further back in time - the oresteia by aeschylus .
you do n't have to be a classical scholar to enjoy this play , but it does help to know electra and her brother orestes murdered clytemnestra and her lover after they killed agamemnon .
o 'neill thought this myth would be an ideal foundation for a " modern psychological drama " of " murderous family love and hate " .
helen mirren cradles paul hilton in mourning becomes electra the first half of the play belongs to mirren 's lustful christine mannon , whose desire for sailor paul mcgann and hatred for her war hero husband -lrb- tim pigott-smith -rrb- provokes a shocking crime of passion .
but in what looks like a symbolic passing of the flame from one acting generation to another , the focus shifts halfway through to eve best 's embittered lavinia .
having persuaded her shell-shocked soldier brother orrin -lrb- paul hilton -rrb- to avenge their father 's murder , " vinny " is sucked into a grim vortex of guilt , fear and incest .
as the author 's deranged alter ego , hilton comes to the boil so often he eventually runs out of steam .
best , though , delivers a titanic performance that puts both her and the audience through the emotional wringer .
sexual jealousy director howard davies is no stranger to o 'neill 's hefty epics , having staged the iceman cometh in 1998 with kevin spacey .
with help from bob crowley 's protean set design and dominic muldowney 's moody music , he skilfully evokes an eerie world of forbidden yearnings , dark secrets and devouring sexual jealousy .
inevitably there are some sluggish patches , and a comic interlude featuring the mannon 's ghost-fearing black servants now feels faintly racist .
but this is still a landmark production of a rarely revived play , with two british actresses at the top of their respective games .
mourning becomes electra continues in repertoire at the national theatre lyttelton .
have you seen mourning becomes electra ?
what did you think of helen mirren 's performance ?
send us your views .
my husband and i saw the play at the november 17th preview .
although there were a few little blips typical of many opening night performances i thought it was nothing less than spectacular .
helen mirren was in top form and eve best 's portrayal of lavinia was superb .
coming from a canadian province where there are as many accents as there are bays and coves , i was able to understand and hence forgive the sometimes inconsistent attempts at southern american accents .
that in itself is a monumental challenge and , overall , the cast delivered an ensemble performance .
the set was absolutely incredible and minimalist enough to ensure attention would be focused on the acting .
i loved the play and would see it again in a heartbeat ! ! !
gwen tremblett , newfoundland , canada beautiful .
for once an actress who is held up and not glorified for the sake of it .
plus the added glory of supporting cast of astronomical proportions .
see it .
please do .
mel smith , i saw one of the previews and was enthralled by helen mirren 's magnificent performance .
all of the players were excellent and managed to breathe life into the play in spite of the gargantuan set .
my only quibble : the accents they used were utterly unfamilar to me , and i have been in many of the 50 states .
most of the mannon family members were doing a cross between manhattan , cincinatti , and atlanta . -lrb- ? ! ? -rrb-
other than that , i am happy to report that mirren 's fainting spell and the heart-attack-bed-scene were superb by the time i saw the preview ; absolutely nobody laughed because those scenes were gripping .
lisa , usa for me the biggest revelation , and best male performance , was from paul mcgann , who i 've not seen act on stage before .
he created a wholly credible character -lrb- and , incidentally , spoke with the most fully consistent accent -rrb- and had more authority and presence than anyone on the stage excepting mirren , best , and rebecca johnson .
let 's hope the national can get him to do more for it .
one other point .
the actors in mourning becomes electra are trying to simulate a range of accents from the mid-19th century united states .
they do so , for the most part , perfectly believably .
even the strongest british and irish actors , in a show that clocks in at just under four and a half hours , are occasionally going to hear their vowels slip .
so what ?
being in the physical presence of the actors , and accepting their human fallibility , is part of the interest and distinctiveness of live theatre .
simon wilson , london it was nice to see helen mirren , paul mcgann and tim piggot-smith at the national theatre , however four and a half hours for any play is way too much !
it could do with being cut back by about an hour .
james van-der heiden , uk well , there 's melodrama and there 's overacting .
the heart attack bed scene was hilarious .
what with the cumbersome and oft-moved sets , the interchangable accents and the light-hearted staging , i thought this was truly dreadful .
very disappointing and not at all o 'neill .
give it a wide berth .
cath dearth , uk having just witnessed the ' debacle ' that was mourning , i can only sit in amazement at the above praise .
it was horrendous .
not only were the accents appalling , sounding sometimes irish , sometimes bad southern drawl , the play was ill-concieved and poorly performed .
the lightness of performance has nothing to do with o 'neill 's dark forces .
i was shocked to find light-hearted jokes where none were intended , and a thoroughly ' london ' / tabloid approach to sex , when the work deals with a puritan new england , not too far from the time of the scarlett letter .
everyone giggled and smirked at this most deadly serious melodrama .
a disaster .
this is not o 'neill as it is meant to be done.the real o 'neill is bleaker than ibsen and as fraught with horrific destiny as a beckett anchored in time .
peter carlin , united kingdom breathtaking , just so beautiful and well structured .
ca n't wait to see it again .
domino , england though i am delighted to have seen this rarely mounted play that has long been a favourite to read , i feel the director missed the boat with the tone of the piece .
angling for more of a gone with the wind feel -lrb- light , southern - eek those sundry and uneven approximations of american accents -rrb- than the more dense puritanical tragedy it was written as .
eve best did quite a wonderful job with a tour de force role .
sharon , france i initially thought " why does it have to be so long ? " - but my concerns about falling asleep in the stalls were swept away as i watched the events unfold .
believe me , it 's a terrific production and the cast is flawless - helen mirren , eve best -lrb- up for an award , surely -rrb- and paul hilton are superb .
and bob crowley 's set is most impressive , as it rolls forward and back to reveal the exterior and interior of the mannion house ... and at one stage , transforms into a ship .
the national theatre has done it again !
andrew buckingham , london saw this earlier this evening - helen mirren was her usual excellent self but the performance was from eve best - she was unbelievably good .
well worth sitting through the 4 hours 30 minutes !
jac , uk outstanding as always .
helen mirren was beautiful , believable and captivating .
i agree completely with your reviewer .
ann powell groner , denmark electra-fying !
amazing stage set and mirren and newcomer eve best are first class .
i do n't mind sitting through another 4 and a half hours of this .
jericho , england helen mirren performs with a breath-taking lightness of touch .
she has the ability to evoke simultaneous distaste and empathy for her character .
she captivates with her body movements .
she both seduces and chills with her voice .
sheila keating , united kingdom i would agree with everything said above bar one aspect ; i found that the set was clumsy and distracting .
the cast , however , were all but wooden , 4 and a half hours seemed like 4 and a half minutes .
harry , uk my wife and i saw the play in previews .
very well done indeed .
however , as others have commented , the accents were distracting .
connecticut is not in the south , and no one in the us pronounces ' past ' -lrb- and similar words -rrb- as the english do .
it would have been better to simply use uk accents -lrb- or the increasingly ubiquitous mid-atlantic -rrb- .

a total of 64,000 people fled the remote , mountainous area after a natural gas well burst last week , releasing a high concentration of natural gas and sulphurated hydrogen .
on monday , some 20,000 people were returning to homes within five kilometres -lrb- three miles -rrb- of the gas field in the town of gaoqiao near chongqing , state television reported .
deadly gas mix of natural gas and sulphurated hydrogen left acid burns on eyes , skin and lungs at least 233 people dead in pictures many had been sleeping on floors in schools and government buildings in nearby towns .
other residents had already returned to outlying areas on sunday , after engineers had pumped 480 cubic metres of concrete into the burst gas well to seal it .
" air and water in most villages are safe now and evacuees can begin returning , " said zhang shaozhi , the local director of environmental protection , quoted by the official xinhua news agency .
but some villages still showed " high concentrations of poisonous gas " which might delay the return of residents living closest to the gas field , said xinhua .
the government said it has set up five monitoring stations around the gas field to continue checking the air and water .
the number of people known to have died rose to 233 after an additional 35 bodies were found on sunday , according to state media .
most of the deaths and injuries were caused by gas inhalation .
survivors described the gas as an acrid black fog that clung to the ground , choking them and burning their eyes and skin .
investigation medical workers have disinfected eight villages close to the site of the leak and removed almost 4,000 animal carcasses which covered the area .
" i want to clean up my house and count my losses because we ca n't smell the fumes now , " one farmer told xinhua .
china is notorious for its dangerous working conditions in factories and coalmines , but this is reported to be its worst industrial accident .
the explosion took place at a natural gas field operated by the state-run oil company china national petroleum corporation , which as of monday had not released any statements of condolence or responsibility for the disaster .
now that the well has been blocked , an investigation has been launched which will decide if the company is responsible .
many of the confirmed dead are children or elderly people who were unable to flee after the explosion .
those who did not escape in time - including farm animals and fish - suffered burns to their skin and lungs from the gas .
chilling accounts have appeared in state media of emergency crews finding silent villages strewn with bodies of adults and children , some overcome as they tried to flee along mountain paths .

a total of 64,000 people fled the remote , mountainous area after a natural gas well burst last week , releasing a high concentration of natural gas and sulphurated hydrogen .
on monday , some 20,000 people were returning to homes within five kilometres -lrb- three miles -rrb- of the gas field in the town of gaoqiao near chongqing , state television reported .

in the fourth part of the series , bridget kendall travels to tatarstan - a republic inside the russian federation whose distance from moscow means it is the local leaders who hold the most sway .
it was our first day in kazan , the capital of tatarstan .
and we had come , of all places , to an acqua park , an indoor water amusement centre .
in front of us delirious children shrieked and splashed as they feverishly tumbled down the water slides , dodging the heaving artificial waves in the biggest pool , ducking to swim through tunnels into smaller grottos .
a slightly distorted loudspeaker voice informed us this was the biggest amusement park of its type in russia .
" the pearl of tatarstan , " declared the voice before being drowned out , rather incongruously , by a shaky recording of tchaikovsky 's swan lake music .
suddenly , round the corner , we sensed the approach of the tatar leader , president mintimer shaimiev .
he moved forward with the quiet , regal manner of a leader who has no need to raise his voice to command attention .
and behind him came the inevitable retinue of grey-suited official courtiers .
we were told the entire presidential apparatus and most important ministers of his government were here for this grand opening .
all looked slightly uncomfortable in the clammy swimming pool heat , and all were dutifully shod , as required by hygiene rules , in bright blue plastic shoe covers .
perennial paradoxes tatarstan is a state within a state , a republic inside the russian federation .
but it is also a signatory to a unique treaty which in 1994 gave the tatars equal sovereignty alongside russia and considerable control over their own laws and - crucially - tax income from their oil fields .
president shaimiev knows the wisdom of keeping the broad mass of the population happy bridget kendall but then president putin took office and changed the rules , once again putting tatarstan 's status under the spotlight .
so is tatarstan an integral part of russia or not ?
it is a key question in the sometimes tense negotiations going on at the moment between moscow and kazan as they endeavour to clarify what russia 's federal system should mean in practice .
this , after all , is one of the perennial paradoxes about russia .
it is true that everything ultimately depends on the federal authorities in moscow .
but on the ground , it often seems that it is the local mayor or governor - or in tatarstan 's case , president - who is the feudal overlord , holding court and dispensing favours , too far away ever to be really under moscow 's thumb , however tightly the kremlin tries to keep a grip on what is happening .
according to president shaimiev 's political adviser , dr rafael khakimov , tatarstan 's independence has already been curtailed .
" take the police , " he said .
" these days they take their orders from moscow , so do all the security services .
there used to be parallel ministries , so we could also have a say .
now they want to run everything from the centre . "
' we live in paradise ' but ask the women who invited us to break the muslim fast of ramadan with them in a tatar village and they will say it is president shaimiev who rules them .
women break the fast of ramadan as the former local communist party chief and an experienced political survivor , he knows the wisdom of keeping the broad mass of the population happy .
hence the acqua parks , and the newly asphalted roads and the gas pipes being run out to villages to give them instant hot water .
not a bad perk for tatarstan 's citizens .
in many other parts of russia , villagers still traipse through the snow to the well to get water .
" we remember times just after the war when we were eating nettles and green potatoes , " said our hostess , as she finished prayers and invited us to a table laden with steaming bowls of soup , newly baked pies and piles of fruit .
" now we live in paradise . "
but the economic relationship with moscow is only one part of tatarstan 's story .
the other is the revival of a language and culture which 15 years ago tatar intellectuals were afraid was in danger of extinction .
language laws across russia as a whole , the muslim tatars are the largest ethnic minority - at least five million strong .
but in tatarstan , they account for just 50 % of the population and mixed marriages are frequent .
i well remember visiting kazan in early 1991 and being impressed by the sense of urgency among tatar writers who were driving the nationalist movement .
in those days their immediate goal was to harness the new power of computers to their cause and launch a concerted programme of tatar desktop publishing .
muslim tatars account for just 50 % of the population in tatarstan " if we do n't do something soon to save the language and literature , it will be gone .
everyone will speak russian , " they told me .
a decade later , new tatar grammar schools have been opened in kazan , tatar language has an equal status with russian in the republic , and muslim tatar women have sued and won a court battle with moscow to be allowed to wear headscarves on their passport photos .
at the parliament in kazan , we were told of plans for a new law to require local businesses to pay 15 % bonuses to workers who could speak both languages ; or , in other words , to pay less to those russians who do not speak tatar .
not a move that moscow is likely to tolerate .
already , the russian parliament has overruled one tatar law aimed at switching the written language from the russian cyrillic alphabet to the latin script .
the tatar government has quietly postponed the move , concerned not to jeopardise negotiations with moscow .
of course we have freedom of speech here .
the press criticise me all the time .
they just have to show responsibility president shaimiev but outraged tatar nationalists say the russian ban infringes their constitutional rights , and warn they will go all the way to the european court of human rights in strasbourg to fight their corner if necessary .
meanwhile , sitting in his lavishly restored presidential palace in the kazan kremlin , president shaimiev smiles his benign grandfatherly smile and tells us there is no conflict with moscow .
" when putin said he wanted more vertical control , i was one of the first to support him , " he said .
" had i been president of russia , i 'd have done exactly the same . "
but surely what this wily former communist chief means is that firm control over his own people is something he also needs , in order to pursue his delicate negotiations with moscow .
so he keeps the lid on dangerous dissent - whether from islamic radicals , or tatars nationalists , or disgruntled russians .
" of course we have freedom of speech here .
the press criticise me all the time . "
but he adds : " they just have to show responsibility . "
another paradox : of all the places in russia we have visited so far , this seemed the least open .
little tatarstan , positioning itself as a beacon of democracy in russia , a test case for moscow 's tolerance .
yet , on our journey at least , where local political control seemed most in evidence .
unless stated , all images by teresa cherfas , who also produced the series .
the fourth programme from inside putin 's russia is broadcast on bbc world service radio starting on 29 december , 2003 at 0005 gmt .
the series will also be broadcast on bbc radio 4 from 5 january , 2004 .

the other is the revival of a language and culture which 15 years ago tatar intellectuals were afraid was in danger of extinction .
language laws across russia as a whole , the muslim tatars are the largest ethnic minority - at least five million strong .
but in tatarstan , they account for just 50 % of the population and mixed marriages are frequent .
i well remember visiting kazan in early 1991 and being impressed by the sense of urgency among tatar writers who were driving the nationalist movement .
in those days their immediate goal was to harness the new power of computers to their cause and launch a concerted programme of tatar desktop publishing .
muslim tatars account for just 50 % of the population in tatarstan " if we do n't do something soon to save the language and literature , it will be gone .
everyone will speak russian , " they told me .
a decade later , new tatar grammar schools have been opened in kazan , tatar language has an equal status with russian in the republic , and muslim tatar women have sued and won a court battle with moscow to be allowed to wear headscarves on their passport photos .
at the parliament in kazan , we were told of plans for a new law to require local businesses to pay 15 % bonuses to workers who could speak both languages ; or , in other words , to pay less to those russians who do not speak tatar .
not a move that moscow is likely to tolerate .
already , the russian parliament has overruled one tatar law aimed at switching the written language from the russian cyrillic alphabet to the latin script .
the tatar government has quietly postponed the move , concerned not to jeopardise negotiations with moscow .
of course we have freedom of speech here .
the press criticise me all the time .
they just have to show responsibility president shaimiev but outraged tatar nationalists say the russian ban infringes their constitutional rights , and warn they will go all the way to the european court of human rights in strasbourg to fight their corner if necessary .
meanwhile , sitting in his lavishly restored presidential palace in the kazan kremlin , president shaimiev smiles his benign grandfatherly smile and tells us there is no conflict with moscow .
" when putin said he wanted more vertical control , i was one of the first to support him , " he said .
" had i been president of russia , i 'd have done exactly the same . "
but surely what this wily former communist chief means is that firm control over his own people is something he also needs , in order to pursue his delicate negotiations with moscow .
so he keeps the lid on dangerous dissent - whether from islamic radicals , or tatars nationalists , or disgruntled russians .
" of course we have freedom of speech here .
the press criticise me all the time . "
but he adds : " they just have to show responsibility . "
another paradox : of all the places in russia we have visited so far , this seemed the least open .
little tatarstan , positioning itself as a beacon of democracy in russia , a test case for moscow 's tolerance .
yet , on our journey at least , where local political control seemed most in evidence .

the fourth programme from inside putin 's russia is broadcast on bbc world service radio starting on 29 december , 2003 at 0005 gmt .

in the fourth part of the series , bridget kendall travels to tatarstan - a republic inside the russian federation whose distance from moscow means it is the local leaders who hold the most sway .
it was our first day in kazan , the capital of tatarstan .
and we had come , of all places , to an acqua park , an indoor water amusement centre .
in front of us delirious children shrieked and splashed as they feverishly tumbled down the water slides , dodging the heaving artificial waves in the biggest pool , ducking to swim through tunnels into smaller grottos .
a slightly distorted loudspeaker voice informed us this was the biggest amusement park of its type in russia .
" the pearl of tatarstan , " declared the voice before being drowned out , rather incongruously , by a shaky recording of tchaikovsky 's swan lake music .
suddenly , round the corner , we sensed the approach of the tatar leader , president mintimer shaimiev .
he moved forward with the quiet , regal manner of a leader who has no need to raise his voice to command attention .
and behind him came the inevitable retinue of grey-suited official courtiers .
we were told the entire presidential apparatus and most important ministers of his government were here for this grand opening .
all looked slightly uncomfortable in the clammy swimming pool heat , and all were dutifully shod , as required by hygiene rules , in bright blue plastic shoe covers .
perennial paradoxes tatarstan is a state within a state , a republic inside the russian federation .
but it is also a signatory to a unique treaty which in 1994 gave the tatars equal sovereignty alongside russia and considerable control over their own laws and - crucially - tax income from their oil fields .
president shaimiev knows the wisdom of keeping the broad mass of the population happy bridget kendall but then president putin took office and changed the rules , once again putting tatarstan 's status under the spotlight .
so is tatarstan an integral part of russia or not ?
it is a key question in the sometimes tense negotiations going on at the moment between moscow and kazan as they endeavour to clarify what russia 's federal system should mean in practice .
this , after all , is one of the perennial paradoxes about russia .
it is true that everything ultimately depends on the federal authorities in moscow .
but on the ground , it often seems that it is the local mayor or governor - or in tatarstan 's case , president - who is the feudal overlord , holding court and dispensing favours , too far away ever to be really under moscow 's thumb , however tightly the kremlin tries to keep a grip on what is happening .
according to president shaimiev 's political adviser , dr rafael khakimov , tatarstan 's independence has already been curtailed .
" take the police , " he said .
" these days they take their orders from moscow , so do all the security services .
there used to be parallel ministries , so we could also have a say .
now they want to run everything from the centre . "
' we live in paradise ' but ask the women who invited us to break the muslim fast of ramadan with them in a tatar village and they will say it is president shaimiev who rules them .
women break the fast of ramadan as the former local communist party chief and an experienced political survivor , he knows the wisdom of keeping the broad mass of the population happy .
hence the acqua parks , and the newly asphalted roads and the gas pipes being run out to villages to give them instant hot water .
not a bad perk for tatarstan 's citizens .
in many other parts of russia , villagers still traipse through the snow to the well to get water .
" we remember times just after the war when we were eating nettles and green potatoes , " said our hostess , as she finished prayers and invited us to a table laden with steaming bowls of soup , newly baked pies and piles of fruit .
" now we live in paradise . "
but the economic relationship with moscow is only one part of tatarstan 's story .
the other is the revival of a language and culture which 15 years ago tatar intellectuals were afraid was in danger of extinction .
language laws across russia as a whole , the muslim tatars are the largest ethnic minority - at least five million strong .

the qualifications and curriculum authority -lrb- qca -rrb- said mike tomlinson 's qualifications task force seemed to be favouring some sort of diploma .
so it was timely to consider " the main example currently in use in the uk " .
its study found that a-levels and the ib made similar demands on candidates , who achieved broadly similar results .
the qca review was also motivated by government demands to include a broader range of qualifications in school league tables from next year .
what it is the authority says the international baccalaureate diploma programme , created in 1968 , has " a number of staunch supporters in the uk who are vocal in declaring its qualities " .
the international baccalaureate organisation -lrb- ibo -rrb- describes it as a demanding pre-university course of study designed for highly motivated students aged 16 to 19 .
its two-year international curriculum allows students to fulfil the requirements of their state education systems without being based on any one .
an " idealistic vision " underpinned the aim of having a common curriculum and university entry credential for students moving from one country to another .
as well as a traditional curriculum it includes theory of knowledge , creativity , action and service , and an extended essay .
" the ibo 's goal is to educate the whole person and foster responsible , compassionate citizens . "
subject groups students study six main subjects - three or four at higher level , the others at standard level .
they are chosen from language , second language , individuals and societies - things such as business and management , economics , geography - experimental sciences , maths and computer science , and the arts .
a-levels , on the other hand , did not call for students to follow an overall programme and there was " little real guidance " on the programme of study even for each subject .
ibs are graded from 7 down to 1 , a-levels from a down to e. comparing the two sets of qualifications was not easy , the qca said .
" indeed , such are the differences that some of the questions are almost impossible to answer . "
findings so four subjects were chosen for comparison , with the aim of covering a range of traditional subjects in the curriculum : chemistry , english literature , history and mathematics .
the study was done by examiners in the various subjects and by university admissions experts .
their findings were that a level and ib examinations were comparable in the demands they placed on candidates .
" there were some interesting subject-specific differences either in breadth or depth , compensated in each case by parallel differences in depth or breadth , " says the qca report .
performances producing different grades at the top and the bottom were also comparable .
some differences could not be reconciled .
for example , ib chemistry practical skills were assessed internally against prescribed criteria , whereas the a-level practical was an external exam .
" these very dissimilar methods of assessing the same range of knowledge and skills proved hard for all the reviewers to compare . "
differences other fundamental differences emerged .
the ib , for example , was " traditionally rooted in a concept of the educated person with which matthew arnold would probably have felt comfortable . "
arnold , the poet and critic , studied continental systems in his role as schools inspector in an effort to improve educational standards in victorian england .
a-levels , far from being a complete programme of study , were designed as " a set of single subject examinations which can be taken in combination with any other subjects or with none . "
other complications came from the modular nature of a-levels and the ability to re-sit modules , and the fact that the curriculum 2000 changes , introducing as-levels , had yet to bed down .
as a result the bottom line of the study is that its conclusions " remain useful insights not precise statements " .

the qualifications and curriculum authority -lrb- qca -rrb- said mike tomlinson 's qualifications task force seemed to be favouring some sort of diploma .

the international baccalaureate organisation -lrb- ibo -rrb- describes it as a demanding pre-university course of study designed for highly motivated students aged 16 to 19 .

" indeed , such are the differences that some of the questions are almost impossible to answer . "
findings so four subjects were chosen for comparison , with the aim of covering a range of traditional subjects in the curriculum : chemistry , english literature , history and mathematics .
the study was done by examiners in the various subjects and by university admissions experts .
their findings were that a level and ib examinations were comparable in the demands they placed on candidates .

the qualifications and curriculum authority -lrb- qca -rrb- said mike tomlinson 's qualifications task force seemed to be favouring some sort of diploma .
so it was timely to consider " the main example currently in use in the uk " .
its study found that a-levels and the ib made similar demands on candidates , who achieved broadly similar results .
the qca review was also motivated by government demands to include a broader range of qualifications in school league tables from next year .
what it is the authority says the international baccalaureate diploma programme , created in 1968 , has " a number of staunch supporters in the uk who are vocal in declaring its qualities " .
the international baccalaureate organisation -lrb- ibo -rrb- describes it as a demanding pre-university course of study designed for highly motivated students aged 16 to 19 .
its two-year international curriculum allows students to fulfil the requirements of their state education systems without being based on any one .
an " idealistic vision " underpinned the aim of having a common curriculum and university entry credential for students moving from one country to another .
as well as a traditional curriculum it includes theory of knowledge , creativity , action and service , and an extended essay .
" the ibo 's goal is to educate the whole person and foster responsible , compassionate citizens . "
subject groups students study six main subjects - three or four at higher level , the others at standard level .
they are chosen from language , second language , individuals and societies - things such as business and management , economics , geography - experimental sciences , maths and computer science , and the arts .
a-levels , on the other hand , did not call for students to follow an overall programme and there was " little real guidance " on the programme of study even for each subject .

just before christmas , the department of trade and industry said it would let internet service providers and community groups use the 5.8ghz band c spectrum .
" opening this band is expected to boost the development of fixed wireless access services , such as low cost internet access in areas not currently reached by broadband services , " said the dti in a statement .
the ministry of defence had resisted opening up the spectrum because it has radar systems operating in band c of the 5ghz part of the spectrum .
low fees as from 5 january , groups can apply for licences to use the radio frequency from the new communications regulator , ofcom .
bt says it wants broadband for everyone the fees have been kept deliberately low , with a cost of £ 1 per net terminal , subject to a minimum of annual charge of £ 50 .
the licences will be available from the start of february .
the decision could help bring high-speed wireless net access to every household in the country .
the telecoms giant bt is already testing a wireless broadband service using the 5.8ghz band of the radio spectrum .
net signals the three-month trials are taking place in ballingry in fife , scotland , pwllheli in wales , porthleven in cornwall and campsie in northern ireland .
the technology being tested sends the internet signal using radio waves , without the need for wires , similar to wi-fi technology .
the signal travels from a base station to a home computer through a low-power antenna .
it is similar to a satellite dish , but is smaller and diamond-shaped and fits onto the side of a house .
if successful , it could be used to take broadband to rural areas which can not get it by cable or over the phone line .
the trials are part of bt 's pledge to offer broadband to all of uk by 2005 .
