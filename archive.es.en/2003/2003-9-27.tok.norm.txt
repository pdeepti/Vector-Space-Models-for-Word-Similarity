in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .
but most observers don ’ t believe it is lucrative enough for russia to risk its strategic relationship with the u.s. after all , the united states is russia ’ s most important trading partner after germany and italy .
energy cooperation in the energy sector alone , the two countries are banking on future cooperation totaling in the billions .
but even there , problems still need to be ironed out .
the u.s. has long said it wants to promote russia as an alternative source of oil as a counterbalance to the politically unstable middle east region .
but russia 's infrastructure is crumbling and requires billions in foreign investment that ca n't come quickly enough .
fears that washington 's new strategic focus is on iraqi oil could make also provide for uncomfortable conversation at camp david . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia says chechen rebels behind blasts after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .
the weapons embargo forbade companies from trading with iraq but some continued to do so , risking serious sanctions . investigators seized files and computers from the headquarters of the companies ksb ag in bavaria , katex textilien gmbh in hesse , and mea machinery and mea international north rhine westphalia . no wmd parts delivered ksb allegedly delivered six chemical pumps , ordered in december 2000 and delivered into iraq through jordan .
katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .
the remaining two companies delivered precision lasers , ordered in september 2000 , to baghdad via a turkish company .
the companies however did n't deliver parts to nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , according to the stern report . investigators say that in some cases it is still unclear if the company 's executives were aware of the weapons trade .
but stern recovered one document from an mea executive that praised the partnership between his firm and iraq . germany has long enjoyed a reputation for high-quality and sophisticated products in the arab world and hussein 's search for hi-tech weapons and durable parts invariably led him to it during the course of his rule .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .

but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .
the weapons embargo forbade companies from trading with iraq but some continued to do so , risking serious sanctions . investigators seized files and computers from the headquarters of the companies ksb ag in bavaria , katex textilien gmbh in hesse , and mea machinery and mea international north rhine westphalia . no wmd parts delivered ksb allegedly delivered six chemical pumps , ordered in december 2000 and delivered into iraq through jordan .
katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .

the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .

russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .
but most observers don ’ t believe it is lucrative enough for russia to risk its strategic relationship with the u.s. after all , the united states is russia ’ s most important trading partner after germany and italy .
energy cooperation in the energy sector alone , the two countries are banking on future cooperation totaling in the billions .
but even there , problems still need to be ironed out .
the u.s. has long said it wants to promote russia as an alternative source of oil as a counterbalance to the politically unstable middle east region .
but russia 's infrastructure is crumbling and requires billions in foreign investment that ca n't come quickly enough .

he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .
but most observers don ’ t believe it is lucrative enough for russia to risk its strategic relationship with the u.s. after all , the united states is russia ’ s most important trading partner after germany and italy .
energy cooperation in the energy sector alone , the two countries are banking on future cooperation totaling in the billions .
but even there , problems still need to be ironed out .
the u.s. has long said it wants to promote russia as an alternative source of oil as a counterbalance to the politically unstable middle east region .
but russia 's infrastructure is crumbling and requires billions in foreign investment that ca n't come quickly enough .
fears that washington 's new strategic focus is on iraqi oil could make also provide for uncomfortable conversation at camp david . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia says chechen rebels behind blasts after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .

katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .
the weapons embargo forbade companies from trading with iraq but some continued to do so , risking serious sanctions . investigators seized files and computers from the headquarters of the companies ksb ag in bavaria , katex textilien gmbh in hesse , and mea machinery and mea international north rhine westphalia . no wmd parts delivered ksb allegedly delivered six chemical pumps , ordered in december 2000 and delivered into iraq through jordan .
katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .
the remaining two companies delivered precision lasers , ordered in september 2000 , to baghdad via a turkish company .
the companies however did n't deliver parts to nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , according to the stern report . investigators say that in some cases it is still unclear if the company 's executives were aware of the weapons trade .
but stern recovered one document from an mea executive that praised the partnership between his firm and iraq . germany has long enjoyed a reputation for high-quality and sophisticated products in the arab world and hussein 's search for hi-tech weapons and durable parts invariably led him to it during the course of his rule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.09.2003 bush and putin to put relations back on track großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir putin and george w. bush are friendly again , but will bush look into the russian leader 's " soul " again at camp david ?
in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .
but most observers don ’ t believe it is lucrative enough for russia to risk its strategic relationship with the u.s. after all , the united states is russia ’ s most important trading partner after germany and italy .
energy cooperation in the energy sector alone , the two countries are banking on future cooperation totaling in the billions .
but even there , problems still need to be ironed out .
the u.s. has long said it wants to promote russia as an alternative source of oil as a counterbalance to the politically unstable middle east region .
but russia 's infrastructure is crumbling and requires billions in foreign investment that ca n't come quickly enough .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .
the weapons embargo forbade companies from trading with iraq but some continued to do so , risking serious sanctions . investigators seized files and computers from the headquarters of the companies ksb ag in bavaria , katex textilien gmbh in hesse , and mea machinery and mea international north rhine westphalia . no wmd parts delivered ksb allegedly delivered six chemical pumps , ordered in december 2000 and delivered into iraq through jordan .
katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .
the remaining two companies delivered precision lasers , ordered in september 2000 , to baghdad via a turkish company .
the companies however did n't deliver parts to nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , according to the stern report . investigators say that in some cases it is still unclear if the company 's executives were aware of the weapons trade .
but stern recovered one document from an mea executive that praised the partnership between his firm and iraq . germany has long enjoyed a reputation for high-quality and sophisticated products in the arab world and hussein 's search for hi-tech weapons and durable parts invariably led him to it during the course of his rule .
since the u.n. imposed the embargo on iraq following hussein 's invasion of kuwait in 1990 , numerous german firms have come under investigation for illicit trade with the rogue state . in the months leading up to the united states ' military invasion in march 2003 , a weapons dossier released by the iraqi government named 80 german firms said to have worked with the country in developing its weapons program . the illegal arms trade continued all the way up until 2001 , according to the dossier . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi report could prove damaging to germany iraq ’ s declaration of its weapons programs contains explosive news for germany , a berlin paper has reported .
the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .
but most observers don ’ t believe it is lucrative enough for russia to risk its strategic relationship with the u.s. after all , the united states is russia ’ s most important trading partner after germany and italy .
energy cooperation in the energy sector alone , the two countries are banking on future cooperation totaling in the billions .
but even there , problems still need to be ironed out .
the u.s. has long said it wants to promote russia as an alternative source of oil as a counterbalance to the politically unstable middle east region .
but russia 's infrastructure is crumbling and requires billions in foreign investment that ca n't come quickly enough .
fears that washington 's new strategic focus is on iraqi oil could make also provide for uncomfortable conversation at camp david . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia says chechen rebels behind blasts after saturday ’ s deadly explosions at a moscow rock concert , russian authorities immediately pointed their fingers at chechen separatists , who they say staged the attack to disrupt russian peace plans for the region .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .
the weapons embargo forbade companies from trading with iraq but some continued to do so , risking serious sanctions . investigators seized files and computers from the headquarters of the companies ksb ag in bavaria , katex textilien gmbh in hesse , and mea machinery and mea international north rhine westphalia . no wmd parts delivered ksb allegedly delivered six chemical pumps , ordered in december 2000 and delivered into iraq through jordan .
katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .
the remaining two companies delivered precision lasers , ordered in september 2000 , to baghdad via a turkish company .
the companies however did n't deliver parts to nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , according to the stern report . investigators say that in some cases it is still unclear if the company 's executives were aware of the weapons trade .
but stern recovered one document from an mea executive that praised the partnership between his firm and iraq . germany has long enjoyed a reputation for high-quality and sophisticated products in the arab world and hussein 's search for hi-tech weapons and durable parts invariably led him to it during the course of his rule .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .

" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .
the weapons embargo forbade companies from trading with iraq but some continued to do so , risking serious sanctions . investigators seized files and computers from the headquarters of the companies ksb ag in bavaria , katex textilien gmbh in hesse , and mea machinery and mea international north rhine westphalia . no wmd parts delivered ksb allegedly delivered six chemical pumps , ordered in december 2000 and delivered into iraq through jordan .
katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .
the remaining two companies delivered precision lasers , ordered in september 2000 , to baghdad via a turkish company .
the companies however did n't deliver parts to nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , according to the stern report . investigators say that in some cases it is still unclear if the company 's executives were aware of the weapons trade .
but stern recovered one document from an mea executive that praised the partnership between his firm and iraq . germany has long enjoyed a reputation for high-quality and sophisticated products in the arab world and hussein 's search for hi-tech weapons and durable parts invariably led him to it during the course of his rule .

in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them . after vladimir putin joined forces with germany and france in taking a strong stance against the iraq war earlier this year , distance and tension became the order of the day between washington and moscow .
even after the initial success of the war , russia stood behind its assessment of the situation .
putin even recently said that washington ’ s current request for aid in securing and reconstructing iraq only served to justify his original position .
yet even though putin attacked the united states during his speech before the united nations earlier this week , during his visit with bush at camp david on saturday , he is likely to look to the future .
and that could be good for the u.s. for a number of reasons .
savoir faire foremost among them is that bush needs the russians for the know-how they acquired in iraq through decades-long engagements in the euphrates and tigris regions .
" he wants russia ’ s cooperation on one most-important issue : iraq reconstruction , " said lilia shevtsova , author of the book putin ’ s russia .
" that ’ s why he definitely doesn ’ t want to spoil any moods or any kind of personal chemistry with president putin . "
bush has his work cut out for him .
he must win over russia , which as a permanent member of the un security council holds veto power , before the united states can ensure the passage of any new iraq-related resolution . if bush can persuade putin to support the resolution , there could be an even greater bounty : the possibility remains that putin could send troops into iraq .
and that 's why bush will have to treat putin as a friend and partner at camp david rather than as an adversary . despite the recent frost , russia and the u.s. have continued to work closely together on many different fronts .
both countries have joined forces in the battle against international terrorism following the sept .
11 attacks on washington and new york .
the u.s. then offered support to russian last year when chechen rebels stormed a moscow theater and held hundreds hostage in a dramatic siege that ended with a huge body count .
though the united states has continued to criticize russia for human rights violations in chechnya , it has mostly done so in passing .
conflict over iran where washington has been a more vocal critic has been in moscow ’ s support for iran ’ s nuclear program .
russia has aided in the construction of a nuclear reactor in the iranian city of buschir .
but the u.s. suspects that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and that russia 's aid has been helping the country achieve the goal of building a nuclear bomb more quickly .
bush is n't alone in his suspicions about iran 's intentions : the internation atomic energy agency in vienna has given iran until the end of october to provide proof that its nuclear program has been developed exclusively for civilian purposes .
but the russians contend that they have only aided iran in producing nuclear facilities for civilian uses and have rejected washington 's accusations .
bush has already said he will hold intense talks with putin this weekend over iran .
“ it is very important for the world to come together to make it very clear to iran that there will be universal condemnation if they continue with a nuclear weapons program , ” bush said this week .
“ people understand the danger of the iranians having a nuclear weapons program – and you bet i ’ ll be talking to president putin about it this weekend . ”
for russia , nuclear cooperation with iran is a lucrative business .
but most observers don ’ t believe it is lucrative enough for russia to risk its strategic relationship with the u.s. after all , the united states is russia ’ s most important trading partner after germany and italy .
energy cooperation in the energy sector alone , the two countries are banking on future cooperation totaling in the billions .

following a scoop by the hamburg magazine stern , german law enforcement is investigating four firms for illegal arms trading with iraq while the country was under a u.n. embargo . germany 's customs investigators confirmed this week that they raided the offices of four german companies suspected of providing technology and material for iraq 's secret weapons program .
the companies , located in four small cities in southern germany , are accused of delivering the equipment to iraq through other countries in 2000 .
the customs office said the evidence came from the magazine stern , which turned over documents found in archives of the bashair trading company , allegedly the center of saddam hussein 's weapons acquisition program in baghdad . alongside german companies , firms in poland , russia , south korea , even the united states evaded the united nations-imposed embargo on iraq , according to the documents .
the weapons embargo forbade companies from trading with iraq but some continued to do so , risking serious sanctions . investigators seized files and computers from the headquarters of the companies ksb ag in bavaria , katex textilien gmbh in hesse , and mea machinery and mea international north rhine westphalia . no wmd parts delivered ksb allegedly delivered six chemical pumps , ordered in december 2000 and delivered into iraq through jordan .
katex delivered 80 acid pumps in april 2000 , through a jordanian firm .
the remaining two companies delivered precision lasers , ordered in september 2000 , to baghdad via a turkish company .
the companies however did n't deliver parts to nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , according to the stern report . investigators say that in some cases it is still unclear if the company 's executives were aware of the weapons trade .
but stern recovered one document from an mea executive that praised the partnership between his firm and iraq . germany has long enjoyed a reputation for high-quality and sophisticated products in the arab world and hussein 's search for hi-tech weapons and durable parts invariably led him to it during the course of his rule .
since the u.n. imposed the embargo on iraq following hussein 's invasion of kuwait in 1990 , numerous german firms have come under investigation for illicit trade with the rogue state . in the months leading up to the united states ' military invasion in march 2003 , a weapons dossier released by the iraqi government named 80 german firms said to have worked with the country in developing its weapons program . the illegal arms trade continued all the way up until 2001 , according to the dossier . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi report could prove damaging to germany iraq ’ s declaration of its weapons programs contains explosive news for germany , a berlin paper has reported .

hathaway , a member of mid devon district council and a member of cullompton town council , said the decision was a " scandalous adjudication " .
mid devon council called for the tribunal to ban him because it said the assault meant hathaway had failed to comply with the councillor 's code of conduct , which orders members not to behave in a manner which could bring his office or authority into disrepute .
the punishment does not fit the crime david hathaway the tribunal , which sat in exeter , concluded hathaway had breached this provision by assaulting the traffic warden .
" this judgment is the first in the country to result in the disqualification of a district councillor , " said mid devon 's director of corporate services , jan shadbolt .
ms shadbolt said hathaway was a member of cullompton town council when the assault took place .
he was elected to mid devon council in may this year .
she said some key general principles of the code of conduct included personal judgment , respect for others and a duty to uphold the law .
" clearly , in this case , the tribunal felt that all three had been breached and has taken a very firm view of the situation , " she said .
hathaway said it was a " very nasty " decision .
" the punishment does not fit the crime , " he said .
" i do not think i should have been disqualified . "
he said the year 's disqualification by the adjudication panel for england in reality meant that he would not be able to stand for the district council until the next election in three and a half year 's time .
mr hathaway appeared before magistrates in june last year and pleaded guilty to a common assault charge .
he was given a six-month conditional discharge , and ordered to pay £ 50 compensation and £ 55 prosecution costs .

for countries like nigeria , space-based observation makes sense a kosmos-3m booster rocket took the satellite - one of six in total - into orbit at 0612 gmt on saturday , after a 24-hour delay .
" the nigerian delegation is very happy to see this event go on successfully .
we 've been waiting very anxiously , " said nigeria 's science and technology minister turner isoun .
nigeria becomes the third african country to have a presence in space , after south africa and algeria .
although russian engineers managed the launch , the satellite 's ground control station will be in the nigerian capital abuja and staffed by 15 nigerian scientists .
disaster warnings the nigeriasat-1 is nigeria 's contribution to a network called the disaster monitoring constellation .
each satellite belongs to one country , but they will share information with each other when disaster monitoring is needed .
for the rest of the time , each nation can use its satellite as it wishes .
either you decide to place people everywhere to monitor -lsb- nigeria -rsb- on the ground , or you launch one satellite space consultant stefan barensky is nigeria 's satellite a good investment ?
a prestigious project for president olusegun obasanjo which has been greeted with much excitement by the local media , the satellite has nevertheless provoked controversy .
commentators have argued that a country where more than 80 million out of 126 million citizens live in abject poverty ought not to be spending its limited resources on a space programme .
' economic sense ' but other observers say that for large countries such as nigeria , space-based observation can make economic sense , as monitoring things like deforestation and water resources from the ground can be very laborious .
" if you have a volcanic eruption that is going to take place , a satellite can tell you in advance that this volcanic eruption is coming , " says former nigerian presidential adviser on space dr ade abiodun .
you start small - you learn from that experience - and from that you gain a lot of capability dr ade abiodun " and therefore the decision-makers now have adequate information to warn the populace to move away . "
dr abiodun says nigeria may eventually start building its own satellites .
the disaster monitoring constellation satellites , which cost less than $ 10m each , have been built by a british-based company , surrey satellite technology .
" you start small - you learn from that experience - and from that you gain a lot of capability , " he said .
stefan barensky , a consultant on international space issues , agrees that satellites can be an efficient use of public money .
" nigeria is a very big country with an important agriculture , with important resources , and a fast-growing population , so if you 're the government , the nigerian government , you have to manage all this , " he says .
" and either you decide to place people everywhere to monitor this on the ground , or you launch one satellite . "
