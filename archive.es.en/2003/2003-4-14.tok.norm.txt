on sunday he took part in the london marathon before his meeting with his uk opposite number , tony blair , on monday .
mr dzurinda 's website describes him as a " fiery " marathon runner , and he has becomethe first serving prime minister to run in the event .
he finished in a time of three hours 36 minutes 27 seconds , eight minutes better than his time in the new york marathon two years ago .
his time was a clear 18 minutes ahead of mr blair 's director of communications , alastair campbell - even though the british prime minister 's aide is three years younger .
the 48-year-old slovak 's enthusiasm for sport sometimes exhausts those who work with him .
his minders , in particular , have difficulties keeping up on training runs .
but party colleagues were also obliged to cycle round the country during last year 's election campaign , on a whim of the prime minister 's .
visiting politicians have also been known to look on with unease as he joins in lustily with gipsy dancers , unsure whether they too should take part - and whether they could keep up .
sport as politics however , things do not always go smoothly for mr dzurinda himself .
on a czech fun run a few years ago he accidentally crossed on to the course marked out for the prague marathon , which was being held simultaneously , and ended up running double the intended nine kilometres .
this was mr dzurinda 's 18th marathon .
he set his personal best of two hours 55 minutes in the malokarpatsky marathon in eastern slovakia in 1986 .
his office said he was running to express support for the struggle against global terrorism and for the us-led coalition fighting in iraq .
there are some echoes with the 2001 new york marathon , which mr dzurinda ran in order to express his solidarity with the city , in the wake of the 11 september attacks .
mr dzurinda had hoped to meet england footballer ashley cole during his visit to the uk , to apologise for racist abuse from slovak fans during a euro 2004 qualifying match in october - but cole could not fit it into his schedule .
doughnut fan mr dzurinda also has a taste for sporting metaphors .
he saw his party 's years in opposition as the early part of a long-distance race , claiming - correctly as it turned out - that he and his allies would win in the end .
he has also likened the battle for membership of the eu to a game of football - one which will be approaching extra time when he travels on to athens next week to sign the eu accession treaty .
on his website , mr dzurinda describes his favourite food as doughnuts from his native spis region , in eastern slovakia - fatty and sugary , with jam in the middle .
a spokeswoman at the slovak embassy in london said the doughnuts were extremely fattening , but added that mr dzurinda has no need to worry .
" he 's quite short and slim , " she said , guessing at a height of 172 centimetres -lrb- a little less than five feet eight inches -rrb- , and a weight of 70 kilogrammes -lrb- 11 stone -rrb- .
" short , yes , " says a journalist who has spent time with him .
" but very energetic . "

researchers are in talks with forces in the region to test the technology - the first time it would be available for forces in the uk .
the new system looks for involuntary gestures which act as clues as to whether the person being interviewed is telling the truth .
the silent talker device has been developed in the region and is touted as having a 90 % success rate .
it uses a video camera linked to an artificial intelligence system that spots small movements people make unconsciously when they lie . "
we believe its widespread use would be a serious and unacceptable erosion of the right to silence " mark littlewood , liberty the traditional polygraph test , used in the us , is claimed by some to have a 60 % to 70 % success rate .
but mark littlewood , of the human rights organisation liberty , said the device could infringe people 's rights .
he added : " the full consent of the suspect should be required .
" we are sceptical of its reliability and believe its more widespread use would be a serious and unacceptable erosion of the right to silence . "
ian donald , a psychology professor at liverpool university , told the engineer magazine that a great deal of interest had been shown in the project .
' micro-gestures ' he said developers were in informal talks with cheshire , greater manchester and merseyside police forces .
dr janet rothwell , psychology researcher at manchester metropolitan university , said : " the artificial intelligence system watches for micro-gestures , blushing and head and shoulder movement .
" at a basic level it is trained to identify an object , such as an eye .
" the next level is to understand if that object is being deformed , for example an eye changing shape . "
suspects and their lawyers could still veto the use of the technology during interviews and the law would need to be changed before results could be admissible in court .
the police information and technology organisation said it was monitoring the project .
the us government is also believed to be interested in silent talker , said the engineer .
