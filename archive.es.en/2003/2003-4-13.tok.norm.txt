leipzig großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig goes for the olympics : enthusiasm barely contained after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany . chancellor gerhard schröder announced the german national olympic committee 's -lrb- nok -rrb- decision to a packed house in munich on saturday afternoon .
leipzig and hamburg were running neck-and-neck until 4:40 p.m. when he finally ended the suspense .
leipzig had been designated germany 's candidate for the 2012 summer olympic games and rostock was chosen by the nok to bid for the olympic sailing competition . " i 'm pleased to congratulate leipzig and rostock , " schröder said .
" the government will do what it can so that the bid is successful .
it goes without saying that all of germany stands behind the two cities . " more than 40,000 people celebrated the news in the streets of leipzig . " thank you for giving us your confidence .
this is a terrific day for germany , a terrific day for sports . "
leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee exclaimed . tough requirements five cities submitted official proposals to the nok in may last year to host the 2012 summer olympics .
leipzig vied with düsseldorf , frankfurt , hamburg and stuttgart . the application process represented a significant challenge for bidding cities .
they had to comply to a 33-page catalogue of requirements for hosting the olympics , including the ability to provide transportation for 150,000 accredited participants and as many as 500,000 spectators on top days . the would-be host cities were required to provide access to a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms within 50 kilometers of the city center .
the nok also considered whether a venue had developed feasible financing for the games and what kind of environmental impact the olympics would have on the surrounding community . rostock was up against kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . a fresh image germany has n't hosted the olympics for 30 years .
that ill-fated event continues to plague the country 's olympic history . in one of the darkest olympic moments , palestinian terrorists held members of the israeli team hostage in the olympic village in munich in 1972 .
two teammates were killed by gunmen , and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt . germany has long sought to refurbish its olympic image , but the country has made seven unsuccessful bids since then , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin . but jacques rogge , international olympic committee president , had encouraging words for the country after the decision for leipzig was announced . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization , have a team with good experience .
other small cities have had olympic games too , like lillehammer -lsb- norway -rsb- .
helsinki was n't big either .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force .

he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles .

they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force .

he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles . " " we should use the experience the u.n. has acquired in other areas in rebuilding a democratic iraq , " schröder said , after receiving an honorary doctorate from st. petersburg 's law faculty on friday . the three leaders all welcomed saddam hussein 's deposal .
they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .
the former iraqi regime owes € 7.5 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- to russia and france each and around € 4 million -lrb- $ 4.3 -rrb- to germany . u.s. deputy defense minister paul wolfowitz had called on the three countries to waive a large part of iraq 's debts to support reconstruction . that issue could be discussed at a summit of g-8 states in france in late may , putin said . putin and chirac were both critical of the u.s. and britain 's actions .

" instead of continuing the " ineffective , inauspicious axis of three " the german government should have begun talks with the united states and britain , he added . his colleague , christian democrat foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble , accused the trio of misusing the summit to strengthen the " paris-berlin-moscow axis .

leipzig großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig goes for the olympics : enthusiasm barely contained after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany . chancellor gerhard schröder announced the german national olympic committee 's -lrb- nok -rrb- decision to a packed house in munich on saturday afternoon .
leipzig and hamburg were running neck-and-neck until 4:40 p.m. when he finally ended the suspense .
leipzig had been designated germany 's candidate for the 2012 summer olympic games and rostock was chosen by the nok to bid for the olympic sailing competition . " i 'm pleased to congratulate leipzig and rostock , " schröder said .
" the government will do what it can so that the bid is successful .
it goes without saying that all of germany stands behind the two cities . " more than 40,000 people celebrated the news in the streets of leipzig . " thank you for giving us your confidence .
this is a terrific day for germany , a terrific day for sports . "
leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee exclaimed . tough requirements five cities submitted official proposals to the nok in may last year to host the 2012 summer olympics .
leipzig vied with düsseldorf , frankfurt , hamburg and stuttgart . the application process represented a significant challenge for bidding cities .
they had to comply to a 33-page catalogue of requirements for hosting the olympics , including the ability to provide transportation for 150,000 accredited participants and as many as 500,000 spectators on top days . the would-be host cities were required to provide access to a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms within 50 kilometers of the city center .
the nok also considered whether a venue had developed feasible financing for the games and what kind of environmental impact the olympics would have on the surrounding community . rostock was up against kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . a fresh image germany has n't hosted the olympics for 30 years .
that ill-fated event continues to plague the country 's olympic history . in one of the darkest olympic moments , palestinian terrorists held members of the israeli team hostage in the olympic village in munich in 1972 .
two teammates were killed by gunmen , and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt . germany has long sought to refurbish its olympic image , but the country has made seven unsuccessful bids since then , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin . but jacques rogge , international olympic committee president , had encouraging words for the country after the decision for leipzig was announced . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization , have a team with good experience .
other small cities have had olympic games too , like lillehammer -lsb- norway -rsb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce the gigantism , " rogge said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a win-win situation for olympic hopefuls five cities are vying to be germany ’ s candidate for the 2012 summer olympics and hoping to bring more jobs and more money to their regions .
but are the games really worth much more than they ’ ll cost ?

leipzig großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig goes for the olympics : enthusiasm barely contained after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany . chancellor gerhard schröder announced the german national olympic committee 's -lrb- nok -rrb- decision to a packed house in munich on saturday afternoon .
leipzig and hamburg were running neck-and-neck until 4:40 p.m. when he finally ended the suspense .
leipzig had been designated germany 's candidate for the 2012 summer olympic games and rostock was chosen by the nok to bid for the olympic sailing competition . " i 'm pleased to congratulate leipzig and rostock , " schröder said .
" the government will do what it can so that the bid is successful .
it goes without saying that all of germany stands behind the two cities . " more than 40,000 people celebrated the news in the streets of leipzig . " thank you for giving us your confidence .
this is a terrific day for germany , a terrific day for sports . "
leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee exclaimed . tough requirements five cities submitted official proposals to the nok in may last year to host the 2012 summer olympics .
leipzig vied with düsseldorf , frankfurt , hamburg and stuttgart . the application process represented a significant challenge for bidding cities .
they had to comply to a 33-page catalogue of requirements for hosting the olympics , including the ability to provide transportation for 150,000 accredited participants and as many as 500,000 spectators on top days . the would-be host cities were required to provide access to a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms within 50 kilometers of the city center .
the nok also considered whether a venue had developed feasible financing for the games and what kind of environmental impact the olympics would have on the surrounding community . rostock was up against kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . a fresh image germany has n't hosted the olympics for 30 years .
that ill-fated event continues to plague the country 's olympic history . in one of the darkest olympic moments , palestinian terrorists held members of the israeli team hostage in the olympic village in munich in 1972 .
two teammates were killed by gunmen , and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt . germany has long sought to refurbish its olympic image , but the country has made seven unsuccessful bids since then , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin . but jacques rogge , international olympic committee president , had encouraging words for the country after the decision for leipzig was announced . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization , have a team with good experience .
other small cities have had olympic games too , like lillehammer -lsb- norway -rsb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce the gigantism , " rogge said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a win-win situation for olympic hopefuls five cities are vying to be germany ’ s candidate for the 2012 summer olympics and hoping to bring more jobs and more money to their regions .
but are the games really worth much more than they ’ ll cost ?

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .
among others , he was responsible for protecting the kurds in northern iraq during and after the 1991 gulf war .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .
among others , he was responsible for protecting the kurds in northern iraq during and after the 1991 gulf war .
this was an operation with a u.n. mandate , and the general is known to support the idea of cooperation with the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq looks toward rebuilding once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .
among others , he was responsible for protecting the kurds in northern iraq during and after the 1991 gulf war .

together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany . chancellor gerhard schröder announced the german national olympic committee 's -lrb- nok -rrb- decision to a packed house in munich on saturday afternoon .
leipzig and hamburg were running neck-and-neck until 4:40 p.m. when he finally ended the suspense .
leipzig had been designated germany 's candidate for the 2012 summer olympic games and rostock was chosen by the nok to bid for the olympic sailing competition . " i 'm pleased to congratulate leipzig and rostock , " schröder said .
" the government will do what it can so that the bid is successful .
it goes without saying that all of germany stands behind the two cities . " more than 40,000 people celebrated the news in the streets of leipzig . " thank you for giving us your confidence .
this is a terrific day for germany , a terrific day for sports . "
leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee exclaimed . tough requirements five cities submitted official proposals to the nok in may last year to host the 2012 summer olympics .
leipzig vied with düsseldorf , frankfurt , hamburg and stuttgart . the application process represented a significant challenge for bidding cities .
they had to comply to a 33-page catalogue of requirements for hosting the olympics , including the ability to provide transportation for 150,000 accredited participants and as many as 500,000 spectators on top days . the would-be host cities were required to provide access to a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms within 50 kilometers of the city center .
the nok also considered whether a venue had developed feasible financing for the games and what kind of environmental impact the olympics would have on the surrounding community . rostock was up against kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . a fresh image germany has n't hosted the olympics for 30 years .
that ill-fated event continues to plague the country 's olympic history . in one of the darkest olympic moments , palestinian terrorists held members of the israeli team hostage in the olympic village in munich in 1972 .
two teammates were killed by gunmen , and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt . germany has long sought to refurbish its olympic image , but the country has made seven unsuccessful bids since then , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin . but jacques rogge , international olympic committee president , had encouraging words for the country after the decision for leipzig was announced . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization , have a team with good experience .
other small cities have had olympic games too , like lillehammer -lsb- norway -rsb- .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force .

he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles .

they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force . "
he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles . " " we should use the experience the u.n. has acquired in other areas in rebuilding a democratic iraq , " schröder said , after receiving an honorary doctorate from st. petersburg 's law faculty on friday . the three leaders all welcomed saddam hussein 's deposal .
they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .
the former iraqi regime owes € 7.5 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- to russia and france each and around € 4 million -lrb- $ 4.3 -rrb- to germany . u.s. deputy defense minister paul wolfowitz had called on the three countries to waive a large part of iraq 's debts to support reconstruction . that issue could be discussed at a summit of g-8 states in france in late may , putin said . putin and chirac were both critical of the u.s. and britain 's actions .
putin pointed out that the fact weapons of mass destruction had not yet been found in iraq called into question the logic of the u.s.-led war there . schröder refrained from criticizing the coalition . opposition denounces summit leading german oppositional politicians were critical of the summit . friedbert plüger , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrat - christian socialist parliamentary group said in a an interview on inforadio berlin-brandenburg it was " somewhat questionable whether it was smart that the three , who were decidedly against the route the americans and british took , met again right after the war and vociferously made demands . " instead of continuing the " ineffective , inauspicious axis of three " the german government should have begun talks with the united states and britain , he added . his colleague , christian democrat foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble , accused the trio of misusing the summit to strengthen the " paris-berlin-moscow axis . "
he maintained that the cost would be continued poor relations with the united states , which was contrary to germany 's interests , he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . free democrat parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said in the same paper the united states was again being confronted by a " closed anti-atlantic front , " while schröder had become an " axis smith " and had learned nothing " from our history .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .

leipzig großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig goes for the olympics : enthusiasm barely contained after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany . chancellor gerhard schröder announced the german national olympic committee 's -lrb- nok -rrb- decision to a packed house in munich on saturday afternoon .
leipzig and hamburg were running neck-and-neck until 4:40 p.m. when he finally ended the suspense .
leipzig had been designated germany 's candidate for the 2012 summer olympic games and rostock was chosen by the nok to bid for the olympic sailing competition . " i 'm pleased to congratulate leipzig and rostock , " schröder said .
" the government will do what it can so that the bid is successful .
it goes without saying that all of germany stands behind the two cities . " more than 40,000 people celebrated the news in the streets of leipzig . " thank you for giving us your confidence .
this is a terrific day for germany , a terrific day for sports . "
leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee exclaimed . tough requirements five cities submitted official proposals to the nok in may last year to host the 2012 summer olympics .
leipzig vied with düsseldorf , frankfurt , hamburg and stuttgart . the application process represented a significant challenge for bidding cities .
they had to comply to a 33-page catalogue of requirements for hosting the olympics , including the ability to provide transportation for 150,000 accredited participants and as many as 500,000 spectators on top days . the would-be host cities were required to provide access to a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms within 50 kilometers of the city center .
the nok also considered whether a venue had developed feasible financing for the games and what kind of environmental impact the olympics would have on the surrounding community . rostock was up against kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . a fresh image germany has n't hosted the olympics for 30 years .
that ill-fated event continues to plague the country 's olympic history . in one of the darkest olympic moments , palestinian terrorists held members of the israeli team hostage in the olympic village in munich in 1972 .
two teammates were killed by gunmen , and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt . germany has long sought to refurbish its olympic image , but the country has made seven unsuccessful bids since then , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin . but jacques rogge , international olympic committee president , had encouraging words for the country after the decision for leipzig was announced . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization , have a team with good experience .
other small cities have had olympic games too , like lillehammer -lsb- norway -rsb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce the gigantism , " rogge said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a win-win situation for olympic hopefuls five cities are vying to be germany ’ s candidate for the 2012 summer olympics and hoping to bring more jobs and more money to their regions .
but are the games really worth much more than they ’ ll cost ?

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .

they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force . "
he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles . " " we should use the experience the u.n. has acquired in other areas in rebuilding a democratic iraq , " schröder said , after receiving an honorary doctorate from st. petersburg 's law faculty on friday . the three leaders all welcomed saddam hussein 's deposal .
they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .
the former iraqi regime owes € 7.5 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- to russia and france each and around € 4 million -lrb- $ 4.3 -rrb- to germany . u.s. deputy defense minister paul wolfowitz had called on the three countries to waive a large part of iraq 's debts to support reconstruction . that issue could be discussed at a summit of g-8 states in france in late may , putin said . putin and chirac were both critical of the u.s. and britain 's actions .
putin pointed out that the fact weapons of mass destruction had not yet been found in iraq called into question the logic of the u.s.-led war there . schröder refrained from criticizing the coalition . opposition denounces summit leading german oppositional politicians were critical of the summit . friedbert plüger , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrat - christian socialist parliamentary group said in a an interview on inforadio berlin-brandenburg it was " somewhat questionable whether it was smart that the three , who were decidedly against the route the americans and british took , met again right after the war and vociferously made demands . " instead of continuing the " ineffective , inauspicious axis of three " the german government should have begun talks with the united states and britain , he added . his colleague , christian democrat foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble , accused the trio of misusing the summit to strengthen the " paris-berlin-moscow axis . "
he maintained that the cost would be continued poor relations with the united states , which was contrary to germany 's interests , he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . free democrat parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said in the same paper the united states was again being confronted by a " closed anti-atlantic front , " while schröder had become an " axis smith " and had learned nothing " from our history .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .
among others , he was responsible for protecting the kurds in northern iraq during and after the 1991 gulf war .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force . "
he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles .

leipzig großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig goes for the olympics : enthusiasm barely contained after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany . chancellor gerhard schröder announced the german national olympic committee 's -lrb- nok -rrb- decision to a packed house in munich on saturday afternoon .
leipzig and hamburg were running neck-and-neck until 4:40 p.m. when he finally ended the suspense .
leipzig had been designated germany 's candidate for the 2012 summer olympic games and rostock was chosen by the nok to bid for the olympic sailing competition . " i 'm pleased to congratulate leipzig and rostock , " schröder said .
" the government will do what it can so that the bid is successful .
it goes without saying that all of germany stands behind the two cities . " more than 40,000 people celebrated the news in the streets of leipzig . " thank you for giving us your confidence .
this is a terrific day for germany , a terrific day for sports . "
leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee exclaimed . tough requirements five cities submitted official proposals to the nok in may last year to host the 2012 summer olympics .
leipzig vied with düsseldorf , frankfurt , hamburg and stuttgart . the application process represented a significant challenge for bidding cities .
they had to comply to a 33-page catalogue of requirements for hosting the olympics , including the ability to provide transportation for 150,000 accredited participants and as many as 500,000 spectators on top days . the would-be host cities were required to provide access to a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms within 50 kilometers of the city center .
the nok also considered whether a venue had developed feasible financing for the games and what kind of environmental impact the olympics would have on the surrounding community . rostock was up against kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . a fresh image germany has n't hosted the olympics for 30 years .
that ill-fated event continues to plague the country 's olympic history . in one of the darkest olympic moments , palestinian terrorists held members of the israeli team hostage in the olympic village in munich in 1972 .
two teammates were killed by gunmen , and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt . germany has long sought to refurbish its olympic image , but the country has made seven unsuccessful bids since then , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin . but jacques rogge , international olympic committee president , had encouraging words for the country after the decision for leipzig was announced . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization , have a team with good experience .
other small cities have had olympic games too , like lillehammer -lsb- norway -rsb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce the gigantism , " rogge said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a win-win situation for olympic hopefuls five cities are vying to be germany ’ s candidate for the 2012 summer olympics and hoping to bring more jobs and more money to their regions .
but are the games really worth much more than they ’ ll cost ?

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force . "
he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles . " " we should use the experience the u.n. has acquired in other areas in rebuilding a democratic iraq , " schröder said , after receiving an honorary doctorate from st. petersburg 's law faculty on friday . the three leaders all welcomed saddam hussein 's deposal .
they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .
the former iraqi regime owes € 7.5 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- to russia and france each and around € 4 million -lrb- $ 4.3 -rrb- to germany . u.s. deputy defense minister paul wolfowitz had called on the three countries to waive a large part of iraq 's debts to support reconstruction . that issue could be discussed at a summit of g-8 states in france in late may , putin said . putin and chirac were both critical of the u.s. and britain 's actions .
putin pointed out that the fact weapons of mass destruction had not yet been found in iraq called into question the logic of the u.s.-led war there . schröder refrained from criticizing the coalition . opposition denounces summit leading german oppositional politicians were critical of the summit . friedbert plüger , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrat - christian socialist parliamentary group said in a an interview on inforadio berlin-brandenburg it was " somewhat questionable whether it was smart that the three , who were decidedly against the route the americans and british took , met again right after the war and vociferously made demands . " instead of continuing the " ineffective , inauspicious axis of three " the german government should have begun talks with the united states and britain , he added . his colleague , christian democrat foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble , accused the trio of misusing the summit to strengthen the " paris-berlin-moscow axis . "
he maintained that the cost would be continued poor relations with the united states , which was contrary to germany 's interests , he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . free democrat parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said in the same paper the united states was again being confronted by a " closed anti-atlantic front , " while schröder had become an " axis smith " and had learned nothing " from our history .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .
he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .
it is clear the system of international law must change and be refined to meet the needs of that rapidly changing world , " putin said .
" it is important that -lsb- the united nations has -rsb- the instruments available to resolve the problems of world security , " he said . as u.s. and british forces struggled to quell looting in iraqi cities , french president chirac said at a conference on international law attended by the three leaders on friday , " no long term international order can be based on the logic of force . "
he emphasized that force should only be employed as a last resort and only with the sanction of the united nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder too , highlighted the importance of the u.n. he said it remained " the sole world body based on universal values and legal principles . " " we should use the experience the u.n. has acquired in other areas in rebuilding a democratic iraq , " schröder said , after receiving an honorary doctorate from st. petersburg 's law faculty on friday . the three leaders all welcomed saddam hussein 's deposal .
they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .
the former iraqi regime owes € 7.5 million -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- to russia and france each and around € 4 million -lrb- $ 4.3 -rrb- to germany . u.s. deputy defense minister paul wolfowitz had called on the three countries to waive a large part of iraq 's debts to support reconstruction . that issue could be discussed at a summit of g-8 states in france in late may , putin said . putin and chirac were both critical of the u.s. and britain 's actions .
putin pointed out that the fact weapons of mass destruction had not yet been found in iraq called into question the logic of the u.s.-led war there . schröder refrained from criticizing the coalition . opposition denounces summit leading german oppositional politicians were critical of the summit . friedbert plüger , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrat - christian socialist parliamentary group said in a an interview on inforadio berlin-brandenburg it was " somewhat questionable whether it was smart that the three , who were decidedly against the route the americans and british took , met again right after the war and vociferously made demands . " instead of continuing the " ineffective , inauspicious axis of three " the german government should have begun talks with the united states and britain , he added . his colleague , christian democrat foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble , accused the trio of misusing the summit to strengthen the " paris-berlin-moscow axis . "
he maintained that the cost would be continued poor relations with the united states , which was contrary to germany 's interests , he told the welt am sonntag newspaper . free democrat parliamentary group leader wolfgang gerhardt said in the same paper the united states was again being confronted by a " closed anti-atlantic front , " while schröder had become an " axis smith " and had learned nothing " from our history .

the three agreed the united nations must play a central role in rebuilding iraq , and force should only be used as a last resort . the leaders of germany , france and russia laid out the results of their two-day summit in st. petersburg to discuss the issue of postwar iraq on saturday and tried to shake off the impression that their meeting was a reaction to the u.s.-british summit in belfast earlier in the week . the three statesmen did not back off from their insistence that the united nations should be the guiding force in reconstructing iraq , but their tones were muted . their views " practically coincided " in the conviction to uphold the role of the u.n. russian prime minister vladimir putin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.04.2003 meet the man responsible for postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge : retired lt. gen. jay garner will be in charge of u.s. aid in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .
among others , he was responsible for protecting the kurds in northern iraq during and after the 1991 gulf war .
this was an operation with a u.n. mandate , and the general is known to support the idea of cooperation with the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq looks toward rebuilding once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .

leipzig großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig goes for the olympics : enthusiasm barely contained after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany . chancellor gerhard schröder announced the german national olympic committee 's -lrb- nok -rrb- decision to a packed house in munich on saturday afternoon .
leipzig and hamburg were running neck-and-neck until 4:40 p.m. when he finally ended the suspense .
leipzig had been designated germany 's candidate for the 2012 summer olympic games and rostock was chosen by the nok to bid for the olympic sailing competition . " i 'm pleased to congratulate leipzig and rostock , " schröder said .
" the government will do what it can so that the bid is successful .
it goes without saying that all of germany stands behind the two cities . " more than 40,000 people celebrated the news in the streets of leipzig . " thank you for giving us your confidence .
this is a terrific day for germany , a terrific day for sports . "
leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee exclaimed . tough requirements five cities submitted official proposals to the nok in may last year to host the 2012 summer olympics .
leipzig vied with düsseldorf , frankfurt , hamburg and stuttgart . the application process represented a significant challenge for bidding cities .
they had to comply to a 33-page catalogue of requirements for hosting the olympics , including the ability to provide transportation for 150,000 accredited participants and as many as 500,000 spectators on top days . the would-be host cities were required to provide access to a minimum of 42,000 hotel rooms within 50 kilometers of the city center .
the nok also considered whether a venue had developed feasible financing for the games and what kind of environmental impact the olympics would have on the surrounding community . rostock was up against kiel , lübeck , stralsund and cuxhaven . a fresh image germany has n't hosted the olympics for 30 years .
that ill-fated event continues to plague the country 's olympic history . in one of the darkest olympic moments , palestinian terrorists held members of the israeli team hostage in the olympic village in munich in 1972 .
two teammates were killed by gunmen , and nine others died during an ill-fated rescue attempt . germany has long sought to refurbish its olympic image , but the country has made seven unsuccessful bids since then , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin . but jacques rogge , international olympic committee president , had encouraging words for the country after the decision for leipzig was announced . " germany , leipzig and rostock have good chances .
we know they are exacting in organization , have a team with good experience .
other small cities have had olympic games too , like lillehammer -lsb- norway -rsb- .
helsinki was n't big either .
we want to reduce the gigantism , " rogge said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a win-win situation for olympic hopefuls five cities are vying to be germany ’ s candidate for the 2012 summer olympics and hoping to bring more jobs and more money to their regions .
but are the games really worth much more than they ’ ll cost ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.04.2003 meet the man responsible for postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge : retired lt. gen. jay garner will be in charge of u.s. aid in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .
among others , he was responsible for protecting the kurds in northern iraq during and after the 1991 gulf war .
this was an operation with a u.n. mandate , and the general is known to support the idea of cooperation with the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq looks toward rebuilding once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .

he called for modernization of the united nations and said that proper consultation could prevent future conflicts . " we understand the world is changing rapidly .

they were , however , skeptical that the united states and britain intended to make room for the united nations to take on the leading role in rebuilding iraq , despite statements this week from u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair that that would be the case . not full consensus although agreed on the role of the united nations , differences were apparent in their views on iraq 's future . while schröder has said it is too early to begin concrete negotiations on the postwar order in iraq , russia and france appear to be anxious to stake out roles in the oil industry there .

dw-world takes a closer look at retired army general jay garner , the man who will make key decisions on humanitarian aid - and lucrative rebuilding contracts - as the leader of the u.s. cleanup effort there . the office for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , or orha , began its humanitarian aid operations in iraq this week .
working out of kuwait , u.s.-led ohra has sent 20 representatives to the southern iraqi port city of umm qasr , where its stated goals are to determine the level of aid needed and to open up a dialog with the locals there .
perhaps most importantly , however , ohra will award key contracts for rebuilding iraq .
the man in charge is 64-year-old jay garner , whose ties to bush 's inner circle and prior experience in wartime administration helped land him the job .
but many feel that garner , who has close ties to the defense industry and is known for his ardently pro-israel stance , is the wrong man for the post .
controversial appointment " currently the task of overseeing the transition to democracy in iraq will fall on the shoulders of a man who was chosen by the bush administration ... without a confirmation hearing or even a press interview , " reads a statement from the web site , stopjaygarner.com , an international coalition of humanitarian and human rights organizations who want the u.n. to assume the main role in the war 's immediate aftermath .
they go on to say garner is " just the man to inflame iraq and the region , " noting that the former army general " until recently was building weapons systems now being used in the iraq war . "
indeed , garner is not only a retired lieutenant army general , but also the president of weapons maker sy technology - which provides technical support for missile systems currently in use in the iraq war .
his tenure from 1997 , when he took the job with no private sector experience , until his temporary leave of absence , featured exactly the type of conflict-of-interest flare-up anti-garner advocates fear will repeat itself in iraq .
biff baker , a retired lieutenant colonel of the space command , alleged that garner used his pentagon connections to win $ 100 million in contracts for the company . garner , who denied any wrongdoing , countered with a defamation suit .
the matter was settled out of court in january .
insider 's insider david kirp , a professor of ethics at the university of california , berkeley , called garner 's appointment a " charming example " of u.s. indifference to the iraqi people , and said it showed a lack of foresight on the part of the united states .
garner is an insider 's insider in the bush administration .
a longtime friend of u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld , he has ties to u.s. vice president dick cheney , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz , and the powerful former chairman of the defense policy board , richard perle .
garner shares their stance on the current middle east conflict , and co-signed a declaration that stated that israel has shown " admirable restraint " in putting down the current intifada .
perhaps with an eye on the controversy , the pentagon has indicated that garner - who has been regularly denounced by the council on american-islamic relations - will hold the position for only a few months until he is replaced by a civilian figure .
frustration in the senate richard lugar , the republican chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , has expressed his frustration that the bush administration has been less than open about the scope of its plans for rebuilding iraq .
lugar says the pentagon has refused his and other committees ' repeated requests to meet with garner , and ignored their calls for more information .
he and his staff have received only " inconclusive and not very comprehensive views " on garner 's plans , lugar said .
" this , in my judgement , is a missed opportunity for the administration to communicate its view on iraq reconstruction , not only to senators but to the american people , " said a frustrated lugar .
previous experience despite concerns over conflicts of interest , garner does have some outstanding qualifications for the job .
his admirers describe him as compassionate and people-oriented .
most importantly , he already has experience in organizing humanitarian aid operations .
among others , he was responsible for protecting the kurds in northern iraq during and after the 1991 gulf war .
this was an operation with a u.n. mandate , and the general is known to support the idea of cooperation with the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq looks toward rebuilding once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .

these development goals are on the agenda for a meeting of a policy making ministers ' committee of the world bank and the international monetary fund in washington on sunday .
a report by world bank staff for the meeting says there are considerable risks that key development goals will not be met , and major work is needed to turn the situation round .
on a similar theme , un high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , says the iraq war is diverting the world 's attention away from africa .
" crises like the one in iraq impact negatively on the funding for africa , where there are three million refugees , " mr lubbers said .
" the world should now focus on africa not iraq . "
he said the un refugee agency needed an additional $ 100m to fund repatriation programmes for africa 's refugees .
developed countries needed to do more to help refugees fleeing from civil conflicts in the continent , mr lubbers said .
' the other war ' the world bank paper warns that on current trends , most countries in africa south of the sahara will fall short of the poverty reduction goal .
for other objectives , especially in health and education , the risks of failure are more pervasive across the regions of the world .
some of the countries concerned and development lobby groups are anxious that the international focus on iraq may divert attention away from what the world bank president , james wolfensohn , called " the other war " - the war on poverty .
he also said that it is an urgent issue where work should not be delayed from one meeting to the next because of other priorities .
he noted that iraq does not appear on the agenda for this meeting of the world bank and imf development committee , but he could n't guarantee that no one would raise it .
both he and the head of the international monetary fund , horst kohler , have however already made it clear that they are keen to get involved in the reconstruction of iraq .

the trio left killhope lead mine in weardale in the early hours of sunday after hearing " strange noises " .
dean maynard , danny jones and ron wilson had asked to spend the night at the north of england lead mining museum , to raise money for a newcastle based cancer charity .
the three men are interested in the paranormal and brought along hi-tech equipment to photograph what they call " orbs " - thought to be the life force energy of ghosts .
but at 0100 bst on sunday they said they witnessed some orbs in what was the sleeping area of the mine , as well as hearing some eerie noises .
the trio stuck it out until 0300 bst , when a woman 's " screaming " in nearby woods , prompted an early evacuation .
the mine was started in 1853 and closed about 1910 , reopening briefly during world war i. for a few short years in the 1870s , the mine was one of the richest in britain .

originally from belfast 's shankill road , he is said to have provided the vital intelligence that guided killers to their targets .
the leading loyalist was recruited by colonel gordon kerr to the force research unit -lrb- fru -rrb- - an army agency involved in gathering intelligence from loyalists .
brigadier kerr , who is now military attache in beijing , also defended nelson to the first stevens inquiry .
