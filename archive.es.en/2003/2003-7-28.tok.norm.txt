a look back at happier times reveals how out of character this spat is . in contrast to the united states , relations between communist cuba and the european union have been distinctly warm - up until a month ago .
as the island ’ s biggest trade partner and financial supporter , the eu ’ s relationship with president fidel castro was unparalleled among western states . then , in april , cuba re-introduced the death penalty and executed three hijackers who commandeered a ferry in an attempt to escape to the united states .
this was followed in june by the arrest of 75 political dissidents who were sentenced to long prison terms . cuba had instigated its harshest political clampdown in decades and the european union joined the world in condemning it . a look back at better times but before the back and forth over the clamp-down stole the headlines , europe and cuba were - one could go so far to say - friends .
politicians such as spain 's foreign minister abel matutes , manuel marin , the former vice president of the european commission and numerous eu delgations have been welcomed on the island and heads of states such as king juan carlos of spain have met with castro as the hand of friendship was extended further in the past decade . in 1996 , the eu offered to legitimately recognize castro 's cuba and improve trade and diplomatic relations in return for assurances on human rights issues .
while noises were made and trade improved , the core demands went unaddressed as the money flowed between them . as well as accounting for some 40 percent of cuba 's trade , and much of its foreign investment , europeans have also maintained links with cuba through tourism and student exchange programs . an estimated 6 million european tourists have visited the island in the last decade .
visitors from germany , italy , france and the u.k. continue to make up between 52 and 54 percent of cuba 's annual tourism numbers and the euro is widely accepted in many areas popular with european tourists . but now , in the light of cuba 's latest actions , this history of exchange and friendship is in danger of collapsing into animosity . the eu takes a hard line in response to the " recent deplorable actions " , the eu openly considered restricting its contact with cuba .
a sharply worded statement announced a number of possible sanctions , including the restriction of high-level government visits and limiting the profile of eu ambassadors at cultural events .
a complete re-evaluation of relations was not ruled out . the statement demanded the immediate release of all political prisoners in cuba .
it added that the eu was " deeply concerned about the continuing flagrant violation of human rights and of fundamental freedoms of members of the cuban opposition and of independent journalists . " castro ’ s regime had violated fundamental freedoms in cuba , said the statement , and its current clampdown was aimed at " depriving civilians of the ultimate human right , that of life " .
indeed , these were harsh words , and not likely to go over well coming from a former friend . castro strikes back castro was enraged .
still fuming at the fact that eu ambassadors had been entertaining cuban dissidents at social events , he lashed out .
most recently , at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the revolution that installed him as leader on saturday , castro verbally attacked the eu , calling it the " trojan horse " of the united states and stated that cuba no longer needed eu funds to survive . but this bold remark follows weeks of verbal tirades , with castro taking on europe collectively and european leaders individually . shortly after the eu statement was issued , castro accused those who had signed it of bowing to the " nazi-fascist policy " of the united states .
he said that the eu ’ s new policy " must have been written in a drunken state , if not with alcohol , then in a state of euro-centric drunkenness . " castro also had strong words for individual leaders .
directing his ire at spain ’ s prime minister jose maria aznar , one of the most vocal of the eu leaders in calling for sanctions , castro said : " from a political and moral point of view , aznar is a coward , " and likened him to adolf hitler , calling him " the little führer with the moustache . " italy came next .
current eu president and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was branded a " fascist " , " bandit " and " a clown " after italy cut off € 40 million in aid . and , last but not least , british prime minister tony blair was attacked for leading the u.k. into a war with iraq , and he was personally held responsible by castro for his role in the death of scientist david kelly , the biological weapons expert who committed suicide two weeks ago .
possible consequences whether these and future remarks turn out to be bluster and nothing more remains to be seen .
what is certain though is that cuba ’ s powerful friend is not happy and the consequences may have more wide ranging effects than even fidel castro can imagine . a breakdown in relations may not only cut the flow of cash from the politicians and businesses but a less than warm welcome from fidel would surely put off some of the 150,000 european travelers that annually vacation on the island .

"
he went on to dismiss the eu as an agent of the united states and called the union a “ group of old colonial powers historically responsible for slave trafficking , looting and even the extermination of entire peoples . ” arrogant and calculating the cuban leader , the world 's longest-serving head of government , used the speech , broadcast live on state-run television and radio , to mock europe 's political leaders , saying they were unable to deal independently with his country without taking american policies into consideration .
castro criticized what he called europe 's " arrogant and calculating attitude , in hope of reconciliation with the masters of the world " – again referring to the u.s. castro ’ s remarks have added more tension to a spat that has soured relations and placed the eu in cuba ’ s bad books alongside the united states . until recently , the relationship between europe and cuba had been amicable , with the 15-member union , cuba ’ s largest trade and investment partner , seen as an economic lifeline for the ailing communist state .
earlier this year , the eu even opened an office in havana specifically to administer the € 14.3 million -lrb- $ 16.4 million -rrb- it provides the island in annual aid . deteriorating relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escape attempt from cuba .
however , relations deteriorated rapidly in early june when the eu raised the prospect of sanctions over cuba 's mass imprisonment of dissidents and its human rights record this year .
further denouncements came after the execution in april of three cuban men who attempted to hijack a ferry and force it to the united states .
hundreds of people try to reach the u.s. by sea every year , some risking their lives in home-made vessels . in a statement on sunday , the eu 's executive arm said it regretted castro 's remarks but intended to continue offering its support in the absence of an official cuban request not to do so .
the european commission added that it wished to " stress its commitment to continue supporting the cuban people and in particular those most in need . " cuba has gone from being the third-richest country in latin america to one of the poorest .
its economy now relies heavily on funds sent from cubans abroad and on tourism , much of which stems from the eu .
despite the economic woes of castro ’ s government , cuba has the highest life expectancy in latin america and one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world .
it also has one of the highest literacy rates , with just over 95 percent of the population being able to read . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : cuba pays price for castro 's arrogance over the weekend fidel castro celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the cuban revolution with a fiery speech in which he rejected humanitarian aid from the eu .

a look back at happier times reveals how out of character this spat is . in contrast to the united states , relations between communist cuba and the european union have been distinctly warm - up until a month ago .
as the island ’ s biggest trade partner and financial supporter , the eu ’ s relationship with president fidel castro was unparalleled among western states . then , in april , cuba re-introduced the death penalty and executed three hijackers who commandeered a ferry in an attempt to escape to the united states .
this was followed in june by the arrest of 75 political dissidents who were sentenced to long prison terms . cuba had instigated its harshest political clampdown in decades and the european union joined the world in condemning it . a look back at better times but before the back and forth over the clamp-down stole the headlines , europe and cuba were - one could go so far to say - friends .
politicians such as spain 's foreign minister abel matutes , manuel marin , the former vice president of the european commission and numerous eu delgations have been welcomed on the island and heads of states such as king juan carlos of spain have met with castro as the hand of friendship was extended further in the past decade . in 1996 , the eu offered to legitimately recognize castro 's cuba and improve trade and diplomatic relations in return for assurances on human rights issues .
while noises were made and trade improved , the core demands went unaddressed as the money flowed between them . as well as accounting for some 40 percent of cuba 's trade , and much of its foreign investment , europeans have also maintained links with cuba through tourism and student exchange programs . an estimated 6 million european tourists have visited the island in the last decade .
visitors from germany , italy , france and the u.k. continue to make up between 52 and 54 percent of cuba 's annual tourism numbers and the euro is widely accepted in many areas popular with european tourists . but now , in the light of cuba 's latest actions , this history of exchange and friendship is in danger of collapsing into animosity . the eu takes a hard line in response to the " recent deplorable actions " , the eu openly considered restricting its contact with cuba .
a sharply worded statement announced a number of possible sanctions , including the restriction of high-level government visits and limiting the profile of eu ambassadors at cultural events .
a complete re-evaluation of relations was not ruled out . the statement demanded the immediate release of all political prisoners in cuba .
it added that the eu was " deeply concerned about the continuing flagrant violation of human rights and of fundamental freedoms of members of the cuban opposition and of independent journalists . " castro ’ s regime had violated fundamental freedoms in cuba , said the statement , and its current clampdown was aimed at " depriving civilians of the ultimate human right , that of life " .
indeed , these were harsh words , and not likely to go over well coming from a former friend . castro strikes back castro was enraged .
still fuming at the fact that eu ambassadors had been entertaining cuban dissidents at social events , he lashed out .
most recently , at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the revolution that installed him as leader on saturday , castro verbally attacked the eu , calling it the " trojan horse " of the united states and stated that cuba no longer needed eu funds to survive . but this bold remark follows weeks of verbal tirades , with castro taking on europe collectively and european leaders individually . shortly after the eu statement was issued , castro accused those who had signed it of bowing to the " nazi-fascist policy " of the united states .
he said that the eu ’ s new policy " must have been written in a drunken state , if not with alcohol , then in a state of euro-centric drunkenness . " castro also had strong words for individual leaders .
directing his ire at spain ’ s prime minister jose maria aznar , one of the most vocal of the eu leaders in calling for sanctions , castro said : " from a political and moral point of view , aznar is a coward , " and likened him to adolf hitler , calling him " the little führer with the moustache . " italy came next .
current eu president and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was branded a " fascist " , " bandit " and " a clown " after italy cut off € 40 million in aid . and , last but not least , british prime minister tony blair was attacked for leading the u.k. into a war with iraq , and he was personally held responsible by castro for his role in the death of scientist david kelly , the biological weapons expert who committed suicide two weeks ago .
possible consequences whether these and future remarks turn out to be bluster and nothing more remains to be seen .
what is certain though is that cuba ’ s powerful friend is not happy and the consequences may have more wide ranging effects than even fidel castro can imagine . a breakdown in relations may not only cut the flow of cash from the politicians and businesses but a less than warm welcome from fidel would surely put off some of the 150,000 european travelers that annually vacation on the island .
there would not only be a damaging loss of revenue but also a loss of faith - something much harder to repair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de castro widens eu-cuba diplomatic rift diplomatic tensions between the eu and cuba were exacerbated over the weekend by remarks made by fidel castro in his speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the revolution which brought him to power .

his outburst has elicited comments in the european papers . the french paper le figaro was of the opinion that the people of cuba will pay a high price for president castro 's arrogance .
the european union is not only cuba 's biggest trading partner , it is also the main investor in the country .

many cubans , both at home and in exile , are just waiting for the day when they can start to build a new future for their country .

by david green bbc news online , manchester ben street is around half a mile from the sports city complex around the corner from manchester 's impressive commonwealth games stadium , lies a row of terraced houses .
red brick shining out against the mid-summer gloom , they were once the epitome of a northern inner-city community - classic coronation street , in fact .
but now ben street 's main features are the grim metal shutters over windows and an eerie , ghost-town like silence .
the contrast with the sports city complex just half a mile away , where much of the commonwealth games events were staged , is striking .
now many residents are wondering whether the games - hailed as a success when they were staged a year ago - will prove equally as successful in improving their lives in the long term .
the city council certainly seems to think so .
only last week it announced the games had created 6,300 new full time jobs , an annual boost of £ 18m in tourist income and £ 570m regeneration money for east manchester .
i moved back here from london because of the games - keith cassanova in pictures but for bill booth , who has lived in the suburb of clayton for 27 years , questions remain .
he said : " i live in heather street and the state of some of the homes that we live next to , that belong to registered social landlords and private landlords , are quite atrocious .
" who would want to buy one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house .
" the council could put some of the regeneration money into these properties and do them up . "
to be fair to councillors , revamp plans for the area have been refused by residents because they fear compulsory purchase orders would mean them taking out second mortgages to pay for new homes .
a brand new canalside apartment block is also currently being built - but mr booth says they are not the answer .
he said : " the new jobs are 100 % welcome and i do n't mind the new apartments being built , which will bring new people into the area .
who would want to purchase one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house bill booth , of clayton , manchester " but my big fear is that these new properties will be too expensive for the locals .
" all of this regeneration , is it for the people who have lived here most of their lives ? "
jim larkin , who lives in bank street , clayton , has similar fears .
he said : " i could see poorer people being forced out into poorer areas and the problems we 've had here being replicated elsewhere .
" i just hope that the whole feeling that came from the games keeps on expanding . "
both men cite the games as the best thing to happen to east manchester in decades .
and in nearby beswick , people like barbara taylor , who runs a homewatch group , have mainly positive things to say .
she said : " it 's put beswick on the map and made people realise that we are n't bandit country anymore .
" there 's been a lot of money spent on the private and council properties which will be transferred to a social landlord .
the city of manchester stadium dominates the skyline " also , while i 'm not too sure people feel a sense of pride at this time , they are n't talking about moving away anymore .
" they can see a future for themselves and for their children . "
veronica powell , 74 , who has lived in beswick all of her life , is equally optimistic .
she said : " it was absolutely wonderful that we got the commonwealth games , it 's the beginning of what 's going to continue for this area .
" ten years ago we had a really bad time because we had horrible flats and maisonettes , and a big fear of crime .
" the rebuilding that they are doing and the hotels that are going to spring up will bring a different kind of people in , but it 's going to bring money into the area .
" once we get the metro -lsb- trams -rsb- here , going into manchester for work will be easy peasy .
" it 's going to be quite profitable for us , i think . "

by david green bbc news online , manchester ben street is around half a mile from the sports city complex around the corner from manchester 's impressive commonwealth games stadium , lies a row of terraced houses .
red brick shining out against the mid-summer gloom , they were once the epitome of a northern inner-city community - classic coronation street , in fact .
but now ben street 's main features are the grim metal shutters over windows and an eerie , ghost-town like silence .
the contrast with the sports city complex just half a mile away , where much of the commonwealth games events were staged , is striking .
now many residents are wondering whether the games - hailed as a success when they were staged a year ago - will prove equally as successful in improving their lives in the long term .
the city council certainly seems to think so .
only last week it announced the games had created 6,300 new full time jobs , an annual boost of £ 18m in tourist income and £ 570m regeneration money for east manchester .
i moved back here from london because of the games - keith cassanova in pictures but for bill booth , who has lived in the suburb of clayton for 27 years , questions remain .
he said : " i live in heather street and the state of some of the homes that we live next to , that belong to registered social landlords and private landlords , are quite atrocious .
" who would want to buy one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house .
" the council could put some of the regeneration money into these properties and do them up . "
to be fair to councillors , revamp plans for the area have been refused by residents because they fear compulsory purchase orders would mean them taking out second mortgages to pay for new homes .
a brand new canalside apartment block is also currently being built - but mr booth says they are not the answer .
he said : " the new jobs are 100 % welcome and i do n't mind the new apartments being built , which will bring new people into the area .
who would want to purchase one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house bill booth , of clayton , manchester " but my big fear is that these new properties will be too expensive for the locals .
" all of this regeneration , is it for the people who have lived here most of their lives ? "
jim larkin , who lives in bank street , clayton , has similar fears .
he said : " i could see poorer people being forced out into poorer areas and the problems we 've had here being replicated elsewhere .
" i just hope that the whole feeling that came from the games keeps on expanding . "
both men cite the games as the best thing to happen to east manchester in decades .
and in nearby beswick , people like barbara taylor , who runs a homewatch group , have mainly positive things to say .
she said : " it 's put beswick on the map and made people realise that we are n't bandit country anymore .
" there 's been a lot of money spent on the private and council properties which will be transferred to a social landlord .
the city of manchester stadium dominates the skyline " also , while i 'm not too sure people feel a sense of pride at this time , they are n't talking about moving away anymore .
" they can see a future for themselves and for their children . "
veronica powell , 74 , who has lived in beswick all of her life , is equally optimistic .
she said : " it was absolutely wonderful that we got the commonwealth games , it 's the beginning of what 's going to continue for this area .
" ten years ago we had a really bad time because we had horrible flats and maisonettes , and a big fear of crime .
" the rebuilding that they are doing and the hotels that are going to spring up will bring a different kind of people in , but it 's going to bring money into the area .
" once we get the metro -lsb- trams -rsb- here , going into manchester for work will be easy peasy .
" it 's going to be quite profitable for us , i think . "

by david green bbc news online , manchester ben street is around half a mile from the sports city complex around the corner from manchester 's impressive commonwealth games stadium , lies a row of terraced houses .
red brick shining out against the mid-summer gloom , they were once the epitome of a northern inner-city community - classic coronation street , in fact .
but now ben street 's main features are the grim metal shutters over windows and an eerie , ghost-town like silence .
the contrast with the sports city complex just half a mile away , where much of the commonwealth games events were staged , is striking .
now many residents are wondering whether the games - hailed as a success when they were staged a year ago - will prove equally as successful in improving their lives in the long term .
the city council certainly seems to think so .
only last week it announced the games had created 6,300 new full time jobs , an annual boost of £ 18m in tourist income and £ 570m regeneration money for east manchester .
i moved back here from london because of the games - keith cassanova in pictures but for bill booth , who has lived in the suburb of clayton for 27 years , questions remain .
he said : " i live in heather street and the state of some of the homes that we live next to , that belong to registered social landlords and private landlords , are quite atrocious .
" who would want to buy one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house .
" the council could put some of the regeneration money into these properties and do them up . "
to be fair to councillors , revamp plans for the area have been refused by residents because they fear compulsory purchase orders would mean them taking out second mortgages to pay for new homes .
a brand new canalside apartment block is also currently being built - but mr booth says they are not the answer .
he said : " the new jobs are 100 % welcome and i do n't mind the new apartments being built , which will bring new people into the area .
who would want to purchase one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house bill booth , of clayton , manchester " but my big fear is that these new properties will be too expensive for the locals .
" all of this regeneration , is it for the people who have lived here most of their lives ? "
jim larkin , who lives in bank street , clayton , has similar fears .
he said : " i could see poorer people being forced out into poorer areas and the problems we 've had here being replicated elsewhere .
" i just hope that the whole feeling that came from the games keeps on expanding . "
both men cite the games as the best thing to happen to east manchester in decades .
and in nearby beswick , people like barbara taylor , who runs a homewatch group , have mainly positive things to say .
she said : " it 's put beswick on the map and made people realise that we are n't bandit country anymore .
" there 's been a lot of money spent on the private and council properties which will be transferred to a social landlord .
the city of manchester stadium dominates the skyline " also , while i 'm not too sure people feel a sense of pride at this time , they are n't talking about moving away anymore .
" they can see a future for themselves and for their children . "
veronica powell , 74 , who has lived in beswick all of her life , is equally optimistic .
she said : " it was absolutely wonderful that we got the commonwealth games , it 's the beginning of what 's going to continue for this area .
" ten years ago we had a really bad time because we had horrible flats and maisonettes , and a big fear of crime .
" the rebuilding that they are doing and the hotels that are going to spring up will bring a different kind of people in , but it 's going to bring money into the area .

by david green bbc news online , manchester ben street is around half a mile from the sports city complex around the corner from manchester 's impressive commonwealth games stadium , lies a row of terraced houses .
red brick shining out against the mid-summer gloom , they were once the epitome of a northern inner-city community - classic coronation street , in fact .
but now ben street 's main features are the grim metal shutters over windows and an eerie , ghost-town like silence .
the contrast with the sports city complex just half a mile away , where much of the commonwealth games events were staged , is striking .
now many residents are wondering whether the games - hailed as a success when they were staged a year ago - will prove equally as successful in improving their lives in the long term .
the city council certainly seems to think so .
only last week it announced the games had created 6,300 new full time jobs , an annual boost of £ 18m in tourist income and £ 570m regeneration money for east manchester .
i moved back here from london because of the games - keith cassanova in pictures but for bill booth , who has lived in the suburb of clayton for 27 years , questions remain .
he said : " i live in heather street and the state of some of the homes that we live next to , that belong to registered social landlords and private landlords , are quite atrocious .
" who would want to buy one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house .
" the council could put some of the regeneration money into these properties and do them up . "
to be fair to councillors , revamp plans for the area have been refused by residents because they fear compulsory purchase orders would mean them taking out second mortgages to pay for new homes .
a brand new canalside apartment block is also currently being built - but mr booth says they are not the answer .
he said : " the new jobs are 100 % welcome and i do n't mind the new apartments being built , which will bring new people into the area .
who would want to purchase one of these homes with shutters up , roofs off , gutters leaking , damp throughout the house bill booth , of clayton , manchester " but my big fear is that these new properties will be too expensive for the locals .
" all of this regeneration , is it for the people who have lived here most of their lives ? "
jim larkin , who lives in bank street , clayton , has similar fears .
he said : " i could see poorer people being forced out into poorer areas and the problems we 've had here being replicated elsewhere .
" i just hope that the whole feeling that came from the games keeps on expanding . "
both men cite the games as the best thing to happen to east manchester in decades .
and in nearby beswick , people like barbara taylor , who runs a homewatch group , have mainly positive things to say .
she said : " it 's put beswick on the map and made people realise that we are n't bandit country anymore .
" there 's been a lot of money spent on the private and council properties which will be transferred to a social landlord .
the city of manchester stadium dominates the skyline " also , while i 'm not too sure people feel a sense of pride at this time , they are n't talking about moving away anymore .

over time , the supply of good vintage wine dries up as bottles are drunk , and this pushes prices higher .
" the majority of the people we deal with are enthusiasts who buy an extra case to cover the costs of the wine that they intend to drink , " says paul milroy of berry brothers & rudd , a london wine merchants established in 1698 .

it is pointless buying a vintage wine only to store it in a cupboard under the stairs .

wine investors should also make sure they ask for documentary proof of a wine 's history .

recently , experts have also started focusing on discovering hidden gems .

for example , a case of the 1982 vintage from the small french le pin vineyard cost only £ 185 at opening , but is now worth a staggering £ 26,000 .
even the most enthusiastic wine buff would think twice before drinking those profits .
however , wine investment comes with a stark health warning .
a succession of investment scandals hit the fine wine trade throughout the 1990 's , most involving extortionate prices charged for unpopular vintages .
fortunately , many of the rogues are now out of business , thanks to tough action from the department of trade and industry , however if offered a particular wine by an investment firm check its price with at least two different brokers - that way you will avoid over-charging .
turning wine into wealth there is a thriving international market for wine , and fine wine brokers will be happy to sell on your liquid assets , for a fee of course .
as a rule of thumb , brokers will charge a 10 % commission for selling on your wine .
auction houses , such as christies , hold regular wine sales - they will charge about the same as a broker , but sellers can benefit as the price fetched is open ended .
in fact , some individual bottles of classic wine have sold for tens of thousand of pounds at auction .
if you want to avoid paying commission , then selling direct to a wine merchant is an option .
however , bear in mind that even wine from a classic year has a finite shelf life - leave it too long , and it could be past its best .

some new world wines are proving sturdy investments , but beware of following drinking fads .
back in the 1960s , german liebfraumilch was considered a shrewd investment by some .
but mass production and falling quality soon killed off the market .
getting started 1982 was a vintage year for french wine .
if you had bought a case of one of the top bordeaux that year , you would have struck gold john downes , master of wine you can buy wine before it has been bottled , when it first comes on the market , or even after many years of storage .
buying ' en primeur ' means investing in a wine before the bottling stage .
en primeur can be risky as you can not be certain whether the year will prove to be a classic vintage or a dead loss .
but if you buy what turns out to be a classic vintage , the rewards can be stunning .
" 1982 was a vintage year for french wine .
if you had bought a case of one of the top bordeaux that year you would have struck gold , " john downes , holder the coveted master of wine qualification , told bbc news online .
over time , the supply of good vintage wine dries up as bottles are drunk , and this pushes prices higher .
" the majority of the people we deal with are enthusiasts who buy an extra case to cover the costs of the wine that they intend to drink , " says paul milroy of berry brothers & rudd , a london wine merchants established in 1698 .
collecting costs buying a case of 12 bottles of wine from a collectable vineyard en primeur can cost from £ 200 to more than £ 1,000 .
you should be able to trace where and under what conditions a wine has been kept from bottling onwards .
berry brothers & rudd wine merchants the year after bottling the wine starts to be regularly traded .
the ' opening price ' achieved is the first clear indication of how the market perceives the vintage .
more cautious investors wait until the market for a wine becomes mature , usually a decade or so .
according to mr milroy , if an investor picks a good vintage from a popular vineyard they can expect a return of 15 % a year on average .
however , such returns , which put the moribund stock market to shame , come with plenty of health warnings .
how a wine is kept is key to its future value .
it is pointless buying a vintage wine only to store it in a cupboard under the stairs .
in order to retain its value , wine should be kept in a temperature controlled warehouse .
berry brothers & rudd charges a storage fee of £ 7.99 per year per case , including insurance .
wine investors should also make sure they ask for documentary proof of a wine 's history .
" you should be able to trace where and under what conditions a wine has been kept from bottling onwards - if you ca n't , it could drastically impact its value , " mr milroy said .
spotting a winner many investors buy on the back of a recommendation from leading world wine experts such as american robert parker .
if a famous ' nose ' declares a wine to be a classic in the making , prices can rocket .
recently , experts have also started focusing on discovering hidden gems .
these so-called " garage wines , " produced in limited quantities by small vineyards , are quickly snapped up by investors .
for example , a case of the 1982 vintage from the small french le pin vineyard cost only £ 185 at opening , but is now worth a staggering £ 26,000 .
liquidate your assets at auction even the most enthusiastic wine buff would think twice before drinking those profits .
however , wine investment comes with a stark health warning .
a succession of investment scandals hit the fine wine trade throughout the 1990 's , most involving extortionate prices charged for unpopular vintages .
fortunately , many of the rogues are now out of business , thanks to tough action from the department of trade and industry , however if offered a particular wine by an investment firm check its price with at least two different brokers - that way you will avoid over-charging .
turning wine into wealth there is a thriving international market for wine , and fine wine brokers will be happy to sell on your liquid assets , for a fee of course .
as a rule of thumb , brokers will charge a 10 % commission for selling on your wine .
auction houses , such as christies , hold regular wine sales - they will charge about the same as a broker , but sellers can benefit as the price fetched is open ended .
in fact , some individual bottles of classic wine have sold for tens of thousand of pounds at auction .
if you want to avoid paying commission , then selling direct to a wine merchant is an option .
however , bear in mind that even wine from a classic year has a finite shelf life - leave it too long , and it could be past its best .

" the majority of the people we deal with are enthusiasts who buy an extra case to cover the costs of the wine that they intend to drink , " says paul milroy of berry brothers & rudd , a london wine merchants established in 1698 .
collecting costs buying a case of 12 bottles of wine from a collectable vineyard en primeur can cost from £ 200 to more than £ 1,000 .
you should be able to trace where and under what conditions a wine has been kept from bottling onwards .
berry brothers & rudd wine merchants the year after bottling the wine starts to be regularly traded .
the ' opening price ' achieved is the first clear indication of how the market perceives the vintage .
more cautious investors wait until the market for a wine becomes mature , usually a decade or so .
according to mr milroy , if an investor picks a good vintage from a popular vineyard they can expect a return of 15 % a year on average .
however , such returns , which put the moribund stock market to shame , come with plenty of health warnings .
how a wine is kept is key to its future value .
it is pointless buying a vintage wine only to store it in a cupboard under the stairs .
in order to retain its value , wine should be kept in a temperature controlled warehouse .
berry brothers & rudd charges a storage fee of £ 7.99 per year per case , including insurance .
wine investors should also make sure they ask for documentary proof of a wine 's history .
" you should be able to trace where and under what conditions a wine has been kept from bottling onwards - if you ca n't , it could drastically impact its value , " mr milroy said .
spotting a winner many investors buy on the back of a recommendation from leading world wine experts such as american robert parker .
if a famous ' nose ' declares a wine to be a classic in the making , prices can rocket .
recently , experts have also started focusing on discovering hidden gems .
these so-called " garage wines , " produced in limited quantities by small vineyards , are quickly snapped up by investors .
for example , a case of the 1982 vintage from the small french le pin vineyard cost only £ 185 at opening , but is now worth a staggering £ 26,000 .
liquidate your assets at auction even the most enthusiastic wine buff would think twice before drinking those profits .
however , wine investment comes with a stark health warning .
a succession of investment scandals hit the fine wine trade throughout the 1990 's , most involving extortionate prices charged for unpopular vintages .
fortunately , many of the rogues are now out of business , thanks to tough action from the department of trade and industry , however if offered a particular wine by an investment firm check its price with at least two different brokers - that way you will avoid over-charging .
turning wine into wealth there is a thriving international market for wine , and fine wine brokers will be happy to sell on your liquid assets , for a fee of course .
as a rule of thumb , brokers will charge a 10 % commission for selling on your wine .
auction houses , such as christies , hold regular wine sales - they will charge about the same as a broker , but sellers can benefit as the price fetched is open ended .
in fact , some individual bottles of classic wine have sold for tens of thousand of pounds at auction .
if you want to avoid paying commission , then selling direct to a wine merchant is an option .
however , bear in mind that even wine from a classic year has a finite shelf life - leave it too long , and it could be past its best .
turning nags to riches ...
investing in a racehorse , the second part of our fun investing series , will be published on 4 august .

a mobile police station has been installed over the last few days at his farmhouse which will be manned 24 hours a day for several weeks to ensure his safety .
a norfolk police spokesman refused to discuss security arrangements at bleak house .
the spokesman said in a statement : " while , of course , the norfolk constabulary has made plans to assist with mr martin 's return to private life , it would be operationally inappropriate to discuss them publicly . "

the spokesman said in a statement : " while , of course , the norfolk constabulary has made plans to assist with mr martin 's return to private life , it would be operationally inappropriate to discuss them publicly . "
martin 's cousin wendy mitcham believes the 58-year-old farmer will want to return to his peacocks , dogs and crops .
martin killed a burglar and sparked fierce national debate " knowing tony he 'll want to resume his old life and go back to how he started -lrb- as a farmer -rrb- , " she said .
" he loves his dogs and he loves his farm and he loves babysitting and giving them teddy bears - he 's a real softy actually .
" he 's knows it 's going to be difficult .
you will never get it out of you .
he 's going to have nightmares no doubt . "
martin 's farm , on which he grows corn , and has apple orchards , has been worked and tended to by contractors during his time in jail .
ms mitcham also said martin is thinking of going to the usa to meet the head of the national rifle association actor charlton heston , who has supported his case .
martin 's home is in a dilapidated state at present she said he was likely to have a big welcome waiting for him when he returned to emneth .
" as far as i am aware there are going to be big banners across the road saying : ' welcome back tony ' .
he will be very pleased , " she said .
martin 's friend malcolm starr added : " although i have tried to explain there will be a lot of people , especially the media , around all the time , he 's ignoring that .
" the way he 's talking he is going back and seems to be more concerned about his crops and his dog . "

martin was jailed after shooting dead teenager fred barras and wounding his accomplice brendan fearon , who had broken into his isolated norfolk farmhouse home .
martin 's mp henry bellingham believes the government needs to look at changing the law in relation to self defence .
" the whole law with regards to householder rights needs reform , " he said .
" tony martin will be campaigning hard on this .
the law is confused .
it needs to be changed .
" i would like to see a law commission looking at this .
the law should be more weighted in favour of the householder .
the burglars entered martin dilapidated home at bleak house " what we have at the moment is an assumption against the householder .
" if a householder takes any action against an intruder , the householder is prosecuted .
it should be an assumption in favour of a householder . "
constitutional affairs secretary lord falconer said that the government would consider changing the law to strike the right balance in cases like martin 's , where fearon had threatened to sue the farmer .
he told the bbc on monday : " i think the home secretary has already made clear that we need to look at the law in the context of the circumstances where reasonable self-defence could nevertheless lead to somebody being pursued in the civil courts .
" the home secretary has already made it clear a long time before today that he was looking to see whether or not there needs to be an amendment to the criminal justice bill to look at that . "
there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas graham virgo , a reader in english law at cambridge university , said : " it is initially a test of reasonableness .
you first have regard to a defendant 's honest beliefs .
" the jury convicted martin because they believed his beliefs were unreasonable on the facts of the case . "
paul gilbert , human rights lawyer at finers stephens innocent associates , added : " what martin 's case also demonstrates is that force used in self defence has to be spontaneous .
" the lengths to which he had gone to defend his property , rigging up ladders in trees as look-out posts and the removal of a stair inside his property did not assist him . "
' lethal force ' allowed in many countries in europe and the us the law appears to give householders more rights .
olivia luhrmann , public prosecutor in dusseldorf , told bbc news online : " in germany the law is that you are allowed to shoot burglars , you are allowed to use lethal force , if you are defending your property . "
she recalled one case in germany where a burglar was shot dead running away from a house with property he had stolen .
" at the first trial the householder was convicted of manslaughter , but the appeal court said what he did was ok because it was justified to protect his property , " said ms luhrmann .
she said the court will also consider how much property the burglar was taking and the age of the burglar .
if a householder shot someone who was taking items worth less than £ 50 or was a child then the defence is almost certain to fail .
adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas in the usa , said that in her state it was likely that martin would not have been prosecuted .
no warning needed " here in texas you do have a right to defend your house , " she said .
" there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry . "
she said that the householder did not first have to warn the burglar for the self-defence argument to operate .
" if he is in the house this would meet the definition , " she said .
this law can also , in certain circumstances , be used to defend the shooting of burglars outside the property .

martin was jailed after shooting dead teenager fred barras and wounding his accomplice brendan fearon , who had broken into his isolated norfolk farmhouse home .
martin 's mp henry bellingham believes the government needs to look at changing the law in relation to self defence .
" the whole law with regards to householder rights needs reform , " he said .
" tony martin will be campaigning hard on this .
the law is confused .
it needs to be changed .
" i would like to see a law commission looking at this .
the law should be more weighted in favour of the householder .
the burglars entered martin dilapidated home at bleak house " what we have at the moment is an assumption against the householder .
" if a householder takes any action against an intruder , the householder is prosecuted .
it should be an assumption in favour of a householder . "
constitutional affairs secretary lord falconer said that the government would consider changing the law to strike the right balance in cases like martin 's , where fearon had threatened to sue the farmer .
he told the bbc on monday : " i think the home secretary has already made clear that we need to look at the law in the context of the circumstances where reasonable self-defence could nevertheless lead to somebody being pursued in the civil courts .
" the home secretary has already made it clear a long time before today that he was looking to see whether or not there needs to be an amendment to the criminal justice bill to look at that . "
there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas graham virgo , a reader in english law at cambridge university , said : " it is initially a test of reasonableness .
you first have regard to a defendant 's honest beliefs .
" the jury convicted martin because they believed his beliefs were unreasonable on the facts of the case . "
paul gilbert , human rights lawyer at finers stephens innocent associates , added : " what martin 's case also demonstrates is that force used in self defence has to be spontaneous .
" the lengths to which he had gone to defend his property , rigging up ladders in trees as look-out posts and the removal of a stair inside his property did not assist him . "
' lethal force ' allowed in many countries in europe and the us the law appears to give householders more rights .
olivia luhrmann , public prosecutor in dusseldorf , told bbc news online : " in germany the law is that you are allowed to shoot burglars , you are allowed to use lethal force , if you are defending your property . "
she recalled one case in germany where a burglar was shot dead running away from a house with property he had stolen .
" at the first trial the householder was convicted of manslaughter , but the appeal court said what he did was ok because it was justified to protect his property , " said ms luhrmann .
she said the court will also consider how much property the burglar was taking and the age of the burglar .
if a householder shot someone who was taking items worth less than £ 50 or was a child then the defence is almost certain to fail .
adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas in the usa , said that in her state it was likely that martin would not have been prosecuted .
no warning needed " here in texas you do have a right to defend your house , " she said .
" there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry . "
she said that the householder did not first have to warn the burglar for the self-defence argument to operate .
" if he is in the house this would meet the definition , " she said .
this law can also , in certain circumstances , be used to defend the shooting of burglars outside the property .

there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas graham virgo , a reader in english law at cambridge university , said : " it is initially a test of reasonableness .
you first have regard to a defendant 's honest beliefs .
" the jury convicted martin because they believed his beliefs were unreasonable on the facts of the case . "
paul gilbert , human rights lawyer at finers stephens innocent associates , added : " what martin 's case also demonstrates is that force used in self defence has to be spontaneous .
" the lengths to which he had gone to defend his property , rigging up ladders in trees as look-out posts and the removal of a stair inside his property did not assist him . "
' lethal force ' allowed in many countries in europe and the us the law appears to give householders more rights .
olivia luhrmann , public prosecutor in dusseldorf , told bbc news online : " in germany the law is that you are allowed to shoot burglars , you are allowed to use lethal force , if you are defending your property . "
she recalled one case in germany where a burglar was shot dead running away from a house with property he had stolen .
" at the first trial the householder was convicted of manslaughter , but the appeal court said what he did was ok because it was justified to protect his property , " said ms luhrmann .
she said the court will also consider how much property the burglar was taking and the age of the burglar .
if a householder shot someone who was taking items worth less than £ 50 or was a child then the defence is almost certain to fail .
adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas in the usa , said that in her state it was likely that martin would not have been prosecuted .
no warning needed " here in texas you do have a right to defend your house , " she said .
" there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry . "
she said that the householder did not first have to warn the burglar for the self-defence argument to operate .
" if he is in the house this would meet the definition , " she said .
this law can also , in certain circumstances , be used to defend the shooting of burglars outside the property .

martin was jailed after shooting dead teenager fred barras and wounding his accomplice brendan fearon , who had broken into his isolated norfolk farmhouse home .
martin 's mp henry bellingham believes the government needs to look at changing the law in relation to self defence .
" the whole law with regards to householder rights needs reform , " he said .
" tony martin will be campaigning hard on this .
the law is confused .
it needs to be changed .
" i would like to see a law commission looking at this .
the law should be more weighted in favour of the householder .
" what we have at the moment is an assumption against the householder .
" if a householder takes any action against an intruder , the householder is prosecuted .
it should be an assumption in favour of a householder . "
constitutional affairs secretary lord falconer said that the government would consider changing the law to strike the right balance in cases like martin 's , where fearon had threatened to sue the farmer .
he told the bbc on monday : " i think the home secretary has already made clear that we need to look at the law in the context of the circumstances where reasonable self-defence could nevertheless lead to somebody being pursued in the civil courts .
" the home secretary has already made it clear a long time before today that he was looking to see whether or not there needs to be an amendment to the criminal justice bill to look at that . "
" there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry " adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas graham virgo , a reader in english law at cambridge university , said : " it is initially a test of reasonableness .
you first have regard to a defendant 's honest beliefs .
" the jury convicted martin because they believed his beliefs were unreasonable on the facts of the case . "
paul gilbert , human rights lawyer at finers stephens innocent associates , added : " what martin 's case also demonstrates is that force used in self defence has to be spontaneous .
" the lengths to which he had gone to defend his property , rigging up ladders in trees as look-out posts and the removal of a stair inside his property did not assist him . "
' lethal force ' allowed in many countries in europe and the us the law appears to give householders more rights .
olivia luhrmann , public prosecutor in dusseldorf , told bbc news online : " in germany the law is that you are allowed to shoot burglars , you are allowed to use lethal force , if you are defending your property . "
she recalled one case in germany where a burglar was shot dead running away from a house with property he had stolen .
" at the first trial the householder was convicted of manslaughter , but the appeal court said what he did was ok because it was justified to protect his property , " said ms luhrmann .
she said the court will also consider how much property the burglar was taking and the age of the burglar .
if a householder shot someone who was taking items worth less than £ 50 or was a child then the defence is almost certain to fail .
adrienne mcfarland , assistant attorney general in texas in the usa , said that in her state it was likely that martin would not have been prosecuted .
no warning needed " here in texas you do have a right to defend your house , " she said .
" there is a specific provision which says you are allowed to use deadly force against a person committing an unlawful entry . "
she said that the householder did not first have to warn the burglar for the self-defence argument to operate .
" if he is in the house this would meet the definition , " she said .
this law can also , in certain circumstances , be used to defend the shooting of burglars outside the property .
