cutting insurance premium rates is at the core of germany ’ s planned health care reform .
but much to the dismay of the government , some company insurance funds have said they would actually charge more starting in august . germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt has made bringing down the cost of health insurance a priority of her wide-ranging tinkering with the country ’ s health care system .
and just on wednesday , leading state-backed german health insurance associations told the government they would aim for significant cuts in 2004 premiums . although insurers haven ’ t agreed to specific targets , berlin would like to see average premiums reduced from the current average 14.3 percent to 13.6 percent of gross wages . but now , germany ’ s betriebskrankenkassen , or corporate-backed insurance plans , have thrown a wrench into schmidt ’ s plans , as some have announced short-notice rate hikes . on thursday , the betriebskrankenkassen -lrb- bkk -rrb- federal lobby group confirmed around 20 company-based insurance plans including those of electronics giant siemens and retailer karstadtquelle were planning to raise the cost of coverage .
siemens bk will have to raise its premium to 14.7 from 13.9 percent of gross wages and bkk karstadtquelle , which will alone affect 2.5 million insured , wants to hike rates from 14.2 to 14.9 percent of gross wages . understandably , the health ministry has criticized the decision heavily .
deputy health minister klaus theo schröder warned that the regulators would " closely examine " the respective bkk applications to raise premiums .
" if there are increases , we will remind the insured of their special right to cancel their policies in this case , " he said in a statement on thursday . the government ’ s health reform is supposed to bring state-backed insurers a windfall of € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
financed through cuts in service and a new tax on tobacco , the health ministry says the reform will give insurers more than enough room to lower premiums . potential for reductions hans jürgen ahrens , head of the public health insurance fund aok , said insurers saw " a significant potential " to reduce premiums next year as a result of the government ’ s reforms .
he told german radio swr that he did not understand those bkk planning to raise rates . but the head of the bkk 's federal association , wolfgang schmeinck , attempted to put the move into perspective .
he told german radio ndr that around half of the 250 bkk in germany would reduce their rates by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points and this was many more than the 20 seeking an increase . germany has 355 health insurers , according to health ministry figures .
companies are permitted to set up their own health insurance funds if they employ at least 450 employees who are subject to compulsory insurance , and if they have obtained the consent of the competent authority . in addition to the bkk and state-backed insurance , germany also has private health care funds , which are often considerably cheaper for younger single people . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government has reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system .
the move has been fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers -lrb- july 22 , 2003 -rrb- www-links federal ministry of health find out more about the planned modernization of the german health system -lrb- in english -rrb- . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .

“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .

cutting insurance premium rates is at the core of germany ’ s planned health care reform .

and just on wednesday , leading state-backed german health insurance associations told the government they would aim for significant cuts in 2004 premiums . although insurers haven ’ t agreed to specific targets , berlin would like to see average premiums reduced from the current average 14.3 percent to 13.6 percent of gross wages . but now , germany ’ s betriebskrankenkassen , or corporate-backed insurance plans , have thrown a wrench into schmidt ’ s plans , as some have announced short-notice rate hikes . on thursday , the betriebskrankenkassen -lrb- bkk -rrb- federal lobby group confirmed around 20 company-based insurance plans including those of electronics giant siemens and retailer karstadtquelle were planning to raise the cost of coverage .

deputy health minister klaus theo schröder warned that the regulators would " closely examine " the respective bkk applications to raise premiums .
" if there are increases , we will remind the insured of their special right to cancel their policies in this case , " he said in a statement on thursday . the government ’ s health reform is supposed to bring state-backed insurers a windfall of € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
financed through cuts in service and a new tax on tobacco , the health ministry says the reform will give insurers more than enough room to lower premiums . potential for reductions hans jürgen ahrens , head of the public health insurance fund aok , said insurers saw " a significant potential " to reduce premiums next year as a result of the government ’ s reforms .
he told german radio swr that he did not understand those bkk planning to raise rates . but the head of the bkk 's federal association , wolfgang schmeinck , attempted to put the move into perspective .

companies are permitted to set up their own health insurance funds if they employ at least 450 employees who are subject to compulsory insurance , and if they have obtained the consent of the competent authority . in addition to the bkk and state-backed insurance , germany also has private health care funds , which are often considerably cheaper for younger single people . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government has reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2003 german bundesliga celebrates 40th anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's timo konietzka scores the first ever bundesliga goal in 1963 the german bundesliga will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year when the new soccer season kicks off on august 1 .
deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .

the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .

the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2003 german bundesliga celebrates 40th anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's timo konietzka scores the first ever bundesliga goal in 1963 the german bundesliga will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year when the new soccer season kicks off on august 1 .
deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .

the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .
the champions kick-off the latest campaign against eintracht frankfurt on friday night , hoping that it will once again be their year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bundesliga season wrap-up german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .

dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2003 german bundesliga celebrates 40th anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's timo konietzka scores the first ever bundesliga goal in 1963 the german bundesliga will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year when the new soccer season kicks off on august 1 .
deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .

as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .

however , net profit during the first six months of the year rose sharply from € 155 million to € 650 million a year ago , when the european union imposed a € 850 million fine for subsidizing parcel services . zumwinkel on wednesday also reiterated plans to expand into the u.s. delivery market .
but its designs on the lucrative american market , however , have sparked heavy criticism in the united states .
and fedex and united parcel service , the largest u.s. express delivery services , have launched a campaign to thwart deutsche post 's expansion attempts . deutsche post already operates in a number of countries abroad , including japan and great britain , where it currently operates via its 50 percent subsidiary securicor omega express .

" cutting costs zumwinkel , who has pushed through an ambitious € 1.4 billion savings plan aimed at nearly doubling group profits by 2005 , said the program 's € 174 million in half-year savings were higher than planned . deutsche post , he added , would post at least € 2.9 billion in operating profits in the full year , € 100 million more than expected .
as a result , full-year profit would come in just under that of 2002 , despite lower stamp prices which will result in € 300 million off profits this year . cuts in postage prices plus the continuing crisis in the press market both contributed to a fall in revenues from deutsche post 's classic mail services .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine .

cutting insurance premium rates is at the core of germany ’ s planned health care reform .
but much to the dismay of the government , some company insurance funds have said they would actually charge more starting in august . germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt has made bringing down the cost of health insurance a priority of her wide-ranging tinkering with the country ’ s health care system .
and just on wednesday , leading state-backed german health insurance associations told the government they would aim for significant cuts in 2004 premiums . although insurers haven ’ t agreed to specific targets , berlin would like to see average premiums reduced from the current average 14.3 percent to 13.6 percent of gross wages . but now , germany ’ s betriebskrankenkassen , or corporate-backed insurance plans , have thrown a wrench into schmidt ’ s plans , as some have announced short-notice rate hikes . on thursday , the betriebskrankenkassen -lrb- bkk -rrb- federal lobby group confirmed around 20 company-based insurance plans including those of electronics giant siemens and retailer karstadtquelle were planning to raise the cost of coverage .
siemens bk will have to raise its premium to 14.7 from 13.9 percent of gross wages and bkk karstadtquelle , which will alone affect 2.5 million insured , wants to hike rates from 14.2 to 14.9 percent of gross wages . understandably , the health ministry has criticized the decision heavily .
deputy health minister klaus theo schröder warned that the regulators would " closely examine " the respective bkk applications to raise premiums .
" if there are increases , we will remind the insured of their special right to cancel their policies in this case , " he said in a statement on thursday . the government ’ s health reform is supposed to bring state-backed insurers a windfall of € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
financed through cuts in service and a new tax on tobacco , the health ministry says the reform will give insurers more than enough room to lower premiums . potential for reductions hans jürgen ahrens , head of the public health insurance fund aok , said insurers saw " a significant potential " to reduce premiums next year as a result of the government ’ s reforms .
he told german radio swr that he did not understand those bkk planning to raise rates . but the head of the bkk 's federal association , wolfgang schmeinck , attempted to put the move into perspective .
he told german radio ndr that around half of the 250 bkk in germany would reduce their rates by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points and this was many more than the 20 seeking an increase . germany has 355 health insurers , according to health ministry figures .
companies are permitted to set up their own health insurance funds if they employ at least 450 employees who are subject to compulsory insurance , and if they have obtained the consent of the competent authority . in addition to the bkk and state-backed insurance , germany also has private health care funds , which are often considerably cheaper for younger single people . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government has reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .
the champions kick-off the latest campaign against eintracht frankfurt on friday night , hoping that it will once again be their year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bundesliga season wrap-up german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .
as was mentioned previously , there may be hard times ahead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rethinking german education following last year 's news that german pupils lag far behind their european counterparts , the government pledged 4 billion euro to boost germany 's education system .

well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine .

cutting insurance premium rates is at the core of germany ’ s planned health care reform .
but much to the dismay of the government , some company insurance funds have said they would actually charge more starting in august . germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt has made bringing down the cost of health insurance a priority of her wide-ranging tinkering with the country ’ s health care system .
and just on wednesday , leading state-backed german health insurance associations told the government they would aim for significant cuts in 2004 premiums . although insurers haven ’ t agreed to specific targets , berlin would like to see average premiums reduced from the current average 14.3 percent to 13.6 percent of gross wages . but now , germany ’ s betriebskrankenkassen , or corporate-backed insurance plans , have thrown a wrench into schmidt ’ s plans , as some have announced short-notice rate hikes . on thursday , the betriebskrankenkassen -lrb- bkk -rrb- federal lobby group confirmed around 20 company-based insurance plans including those of electronics giant siemens and retailer karstadtquelle were planning to raise the cost of coverage .
siemens bk will have to raise its premium to 14.7 from 13.9 percent of gross wages and bkk karstadtquelle , which will alone affect 2.5 million insured , wants to hike rates from 14.2 to 14.9 percent of gross wages . understandably , the health ministry has criticized the decision heavily .
deputy health minister klaus theo schröder warned that the regulators would " closely examine " the respective bkk applications to raise premiums .
" if there are increases , we will remind the insured of their special right to cancel their policies in this case , " he said in a statement on thursday . the government ’ s health reform is supposed to bring state-backed insurers a windfall of € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 .
financed through cuts in service and a new tax on tobacco , the health ministry says the reform will give insurers more than enough room to lower premiums . potential for reductions hans jürgen ahrens , head of the public health insurance fund aok , said insurers saw " a significant potential " to reduce premiums next year as a result of the government ’ s reforms .
he told german radio swr that he did not understand those bkk planning to raise rates . but the head of the bkk 's federal association , wolfgang schmeinck , attempted to put the move into perspective .
he told german radio ndr that around half of the 250 bkk in germany would reduce their rates by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points and this was many more than the 20 seeking an increase . germany has 355 health insurers , according to health ministry figures .
companies are permitted to set up their own health insurance funds if they employ at least 450 employees who are subject to compulsory insurance , and if they have obtained the consent of the competent authority . in addition to the bkk and state-backed insurance , germany also has private health care funds , which are often considerably cheaper for younger single people . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government has reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system .

however , net profit during the first six months of the year rose sharply from € 155 million to € 650 million a year ago , when the european union imposed a € 850 million fine for subsidizing parcel services . zumwinkel on wednesday also reiterated plans to expand into the u.s. delivery market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2003 teachers plan to " sex up " german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers hope that german will become attractive to all ages an international conference of german language teachers concluded with plans to make the language more attractive and to adopt a more aggressive approach to its promotion . german is sexy , apparently , and should therefore be used more as an international language .
that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .
as was mentioned previously , there may be hard times ahead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rethinking german education following last year 's news that german pupils lag far behind their european counterparts , the government pledged 4 billion euro to boost germany 's education system .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .
the champions kick-off the latest campaign against eintracht frankfurt on friday night , hoping that it will once again be their year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bundesliga season wrap-up german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

however , net profit during the first six months of the year rose sharply from € 155 million to € 650 million a year ago , when the european union imposed a € 850 million fine for subsidizing parcel services . zumwinkel on wednesday also reiterated plans to expand into the u.s. delivery market .
but its designs on the lucrative american market , however , have sparked heavy criticism in the united states .
and fedex and united parcel service , the largest u.s. express delivery services , have launched a campaign to thwart deutsche post 's expansion attempts . deutsche post already operates in a number of countries abroad , including japan and great britain , where it currently operates via its 50 percent subsidiary securicor omega express .
it has also shown intensive interest in the privatization of postal services in austria and denmark .
but the united states market is proving more difficult to crack . dhl as the key as deutsche post is the direct owner of dhl airways , a miami-based airline whose biggest customer is dhl worldwide express , which is a unit of deutsche post , they argue that the german postal operator would be violating foreign ownership airline rules , if it saw through with its plans . in addition , deutsche post is buying airborne express 's u.s. ground services for $ 1.05 billion . dhl airways tried to defuse the dispute when it announced a u.s. investor group had purchased all the shares of the air carrier , thus putting it in the hands of u.s. share-holders .
however , the u.s. department of transportation is examining the case .
a decision is due in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on wednesday , klaus zumwinkel -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was optimistic .
" the group will be strengthening its involvement on the u.s. express market in the coming months and following the merger with airborne express , we will rise to be the number three in the world 's largest express market . " cutting costs zumwinkel , who has pushed through an ambitious € 1.4 billion savings plan aimed at nearly doubling group profits by 2005 , said the program 's € 174 million in half-year savings were higher than planned . deutsche post , he added , would post at least € 2.9 billion in operating profits in the full year , € 100 million more than expected .
as a result , full-year profit would come in just under that of 2002 , despite lower stamp prices which will result in € 300 million off profits this year . cuts in postage prices plus the continuing crisis in the press market both contributed to a fall in revenues from deutsche post 's classic mail services .
these were topped by revenues from deutsche post 's courier and express services which now form deutsche post 's leading unit , increasing by 2.7 percent to € 7.9 billion , in particular due to european business .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .

chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .

dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .

“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2003 german bundesliga celebrates 40th anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's timo konietzka scores the first ever bundesliga goal in 1963 the german bundesliga will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year when the new soccer season kicks off on august 1 .
deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .

however , net profit during the first six months of the year rose sharply from € 155 million to € 650 million a year ago , when the european union imposed a € 850 million fine for subsidizing parcel services . zumwinkel on wednesday also reiterated plans to expand into the u.s. delivery market .
but its designs on the lucrative american market , however , have sparked heavy criticism in the united states .
and fedex and united parcel service , the largest u.s. express delivery services , have launched a campaign to thwart deutsche post 's expansion attempts . deutsche post already operates in a number of countries abroad , including japan and great britain , where it currently operates via its 50 percent subsidiary securicor omega express .
it has also shown intensive interest in the privatization of postal services in austria and denmark .
but the united states market is proving more difficult to crack . dhl as the key as deutsche post is the direct owner of dhl airways , a miami-based airline whose biggest customer is dhl worldwide express , which is a unit of deutsche post , they argue that the german postal operator would be violating foreign ownership airline rules , if it saw through with its plans . in addition , deutsche post is buying airborne express 's u.s. ground services for $ 1.05 billion . dhl airways tried to defuse the dispute when it announced a u.s. investor group had purchased all the shares of the air carrier , thus putting it in the hands of u.s. share-holders .
however , the u.s. department of transportation is examining the case .
a decision is due in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on wednesday , klaus zumwinkel -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was optimistic .
" the group will be strengthening its involvement on the u.s. express market in the coming months and following the merger with airborne express , we will rise to be the number three in the world 's largest express market . " cutting costs zumwinkel , who has pushed through an ambitious € 1.4 billion savings plan aimed at nearly doubling group profits by 2005 , said the program 's € 174 million in half-year savings were higher than planned . deutsche post , he added , would post at least € 2.9 billion in operating profits in the full year , € 100 million more than expected .
as a result , full-year profit would come in just under that of 2002 , despite lower stamp prices which will result in € 300 million off profits this year . cuts in postage prices plus the continuing crisis in the press market both contributed to a fall in revenues from deutsche post 's classic mail services .
these were topped by revenues from deutsche post 's courier and express services which now form deutsche post 's leading unit , increasing by 2.7 percent to € 7.9 billion , in particular due to european business .
here , revenues grew by a record 4.4 percent , in particular in germany and spain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post to enter british letter-delivery market the german postal services giant deutsche post says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .

in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine .

however , net profit during the first six months of the year rose sharply from € 155 million to € 650 million a year ago , when the european union imposed a € 850 million fine for subsidizing parcel services . zumwinkel on wednesday also reiterated plans to expand into the u.s. delivery market .
but its designs on the lucrative american market , however , have sparked heavy criticism in the united states .
and fedex and united parcel service , the largest u.s. express delivery services , have launched a campaign to thwart deutsche post 's expansion attempts . deutsche post already operates in a number of countries abroad , including japan and great britain , where it currently operates via its 50 percent subsidiary securicor omega express .
it has also shown intensive interest in the privatization of postal services in austria and denmark .
but the united states market is proving more difficult to crack . dhl as the key as deutsche post is the direct owner of dhl airways , a miami-based airline whose biggest customer is dhl worldwide express , which is a unit of deutsche post , they argue that the german postal operator would be violating foreign ownership airline rules , if it saw through with its plans . in addition , deutsche post is buying airborne express 's u.s. ground services for $ 1.05 billion . dhl airways tried to defuse the dispute when it announced a u.s. investor group had purchased all the shares of the air carrier , thus putting it in the hands of u.s. share-holders .
however , the u.s. department of transportation is examining the case .
a decision is due in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on wednesday , klaus zumwinkel -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was optimistic .
" the group will be strengthening its involvement on the u.s. express market in the coming months and following the merger with airborne express , we will rise to be the number three in the world 's largest express market . " cutting costs zumwinkel , who has pushed through an ambitious € 1.4 billion savings plan aimed at nearly doubling group profits by 2005 , said the program 's € 174 million in half-year savings were higher than planned . deutsche post , he added , would post at least € 2.9 billion in operating profits in the full year , € 100 million more than expected .
as a result , full-year profit would come in just under that of 2002 , despite lower stamp prices which will result in € 300 million off profits this year . cuts in postage prices plus the continuing crisis in the press market both contributed to a fall in revenues from deutsche post 's classic mail services .
these were topped by revenues from deutsche post 's courier and express services which now form deutsche post 's leading unit , increasing by 2.7 percent to € 7.9 billion , in particular due to european business .
here , revenues grew by a record 4.4 percent , in particular in germany and spain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post to enter british letter-delivery market the german postal services giant deutsche post says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2003 german bundesliga celebrates 40th anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's timo konietzka scores the first ever bundesliga goal in 1963 the german bundesliga will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year when the new soccer season kicks off on august 1 .
deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .

dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .

that ’ s the conclusion of the international association of german teachers which just concluded its annual conference at the friedrich schiller university in jena on monday . but the task ahead will not be an easy one for those who wish to persuade native speakers and foreign students to speak more german abroad and to start being proud of the mother tongue of luther , goethe and franz beckenbauer .
chances are that it will take more than just a snappy catchphrase to overcome the barriers that prevent german from becoming a true " lingua franca " or lingua germania . one of the main problems facing the teachers stems from german businesses which do not promote the use of their own language in other countries when their employees travel or when they set up daughter companies abroad .
for students of german , the prospect of a career where the language of international business is more likely to be english is hardly the most motivating influence .
for this reason teachers hope that their plan to make german more attractive will push companies to speak their own language adopting lingua franca model so , what can be done to make german more attractive ?
well , to start with , the conference concluded that the language must first be spread by those speakers already confident and proud of their german skills .
to do this , the teachers have expressed a desire to follow the lingua franca model where the french language is aggressively promoted among native speakers around the world .
the french are renowned for their pride in their language and their mostly unshakeable use of it at home in france and in former colonies . sebastian bemile , the vice president of the international association of german teachers , comes from ghana : “ we ’ re surrounded by french speaking lands and france is very aggressive in its promotion of its language , ” he said .
“ the german teachers try the best they can to promote the language .
i love the german language .
i can ’ t say that the germans themselves don ’ t , but we would like them to be more aggressive . ” lack of language policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german is taught but is it promoted ?
dr. hermann funk , one of the 80 professors attending the conference in jena , went a step further when he criticized the germans themselves .
“ there is no german language policy .
in france , language is a political issue .
in germany , it is something more or less dealt with . ” convincing the germans that their own language is attractive is one thing .
getting the 17 million students worldwide who spend three years learning german as their second foreign language to use it instead of english or french is another .
the task looks even more daunting when even those students who learn german as their first foreign language avoid using it .
this is a particular problem in eastern and central european countries where english has become the choice language after the native one . helena hanuljakova from slovakia says her job in bratislava is made even harder by the germans working and visiting there who insist on conversing with the locals in english .
this is despite the fact that german is the first foreign language in her country .
“ we ’ ve already learned , and not just in slovakia but from other countries , that this de-motivates our students .
they just don ’ t use the language . ” international decrease in popularity the decrease in popularity of german learning is also a problem elsewhere in the world .
levels are dropping in britain , france , denmark and the united states - where german learning has dropped 11 percent in the last year - , although there have been increases in interest in japan , greece , finland and mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they be motivated to use their german ?
“ the decrease -lrb- in german learning -rrb- is mostly in western europe , especially france and britain , ” said hans barkowski , a professor for foreign german studies in jena .
“ countries where just one language is traditionally learned are a particular concern for us . ” personal and virtual contact to tackle the international problem , the teachers hope that german tourists will carry the language with them on their travels and not be afraid to use it in personal contact with other holiday-makers .
they also believe that making virtual contact through a larger internet presence with more german language sites and services would help spread the word .
german is , after all , the second most frequent internet language after english , despite being only the fourth most spoken among the web 's surfers . other plans are more adventurous and creative .
the german teachers are planning a german olympiad in denmark to promote the language through sports and are hoping to export german folk music , or schlager , in an attempt to replicate the interest the buena vista social club generated in cuba .

however , net profit during the first six months of the year rose sharply from € 155 million to € 650 million a year ago , when the european union imposed a € 850 million fine for subsidizing parcel services . zumwinkel on wednesday also reiterated plans to expand into the u.s. delivery market .
but its designs on the lucrative american market , however , have sparked heavy criticism in the united states .
and fedex and united parcel service , the largest u.s. express delivery services , have launched a campaign to thwart deutsche post 's expansion attempts . deutsche post already operates in a number of countries abroad , including japan and great britain , where it currently operates via its 50 percent subsidiary securicor omega express .
it has also shown intensive interest in the privatization of postal services in austria and denmark .
but the united states market is proving more difficult to crack . dhl as the key as deutsche post is the direct owner of dhl airways , a miami-based airline whose biggest customer is dhl worldwide express , which is a unit of deutsche post , they argue that the german postal operator would be violating foreign ownership airline rules , if it saw through with its plans . in addition , deutsche post is buying airborne express 's u.s. ground services for $ 1.05 billion . dhl airways tried to defuse the dispute when it announced a u.s. investor group had purchased all the shares of the air carrier , thus putting it in the hands of u.s. share-holders .
however , the u.s. department of transportation is examining the case .
a decision is due in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on wednesday , klaus zumwinkel -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was optimistic .
" the group will be strengthening its involvement on the u.s. express market in the coming months and following the merger with airborne express , we will rise to be the number three in the world 's largest express market . " cutting costs zumwinkel , who has pushed through an ambitious € 1.4 billion savings plan aimed at nearly doubling group profits by 2005 , said the program 's € 174 million in half-year savings were higher than planned . deutsche post , he added , would post at least € 2.9 billion in operating profits in the full year , € 100 million more than expected .
as a result , full-year profit would come in just under that of 2002 , despite lower stamp prices which will result in € 300 million off profits this year . cuts in postage prices plus the continuing crisis in the press market both contributed to a fall in revenues from deutsche post 's classic mail services .
these were topped by revenues from deutsche post 's courier and express services which now form deutsche post 's leading unit , increasing by 2.7 percent to € 7.9 billion , in particular due to european business .
here , revenues grew by a record 4.4 percent , in particular in germany and spain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post to enter british letter-delivery market the german postal services giant deutsche post says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .

despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .

the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
many experts , including 14 of the 18 bundesliga coaches , believe bayern munich will repeat last year ’ s stroll to a record extending 19th title in this anniversary year .
the champions kick-off the latest campaign against eintracht frankfurt on friday night , hoping that it will once again be their year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bundesliga season wrap-up german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .

as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .

deutsche welle looks back at the up and downs of germany ’ s professional league . forty years and 38,058 goals ago , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy , this year ’ s anniversary provides an opportunity to look back over four decades of soccer excitement .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in an example of how circular the game can be , the first winners of the league were 1.f.c. köln , this season ’ s newly promoted second division champions who return to the top flight for the anniversary of both the league ’ s launch and their first championship .
humble beginnings in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga is currently suffering a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire , which sunk in bankruptcy , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 40 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 17 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der bomber strikes .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the moneymaker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund celebrate their 2001/02 championship win .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .

in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .

" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .

however , net profit during the first six months of the year rose sharply from € 155 million to € 650 million a year ago , when the european union imposed a € 850 million fine for subsidizing parcel services . zumwinkel on wednesday also reiterated plans to expand into the u.s. delivery market .
but its designs on the lucrative american market , however , have sparked heavy criticism in the united states .
and fedex and united parcel service , the largest u.s. express delivery services , have launched a campaign to thwart deutsche post 's expansion attempts . deutsche post already operates in a number of countries abroad , including japan and great britain , where it currently operates via its 50 percent subsidiary securicor omega express .
it has also shown intensive interest in the privatization of postal services in austria and denmark .
but the united states market is proving more difficult to crack . dhl as the key as deutsche post is the direct owner of dhl airways , a miami-based airline whose biggest customer is dhl worldwide express , which is a unit of deutsche post , they argue that the german postal operator would be violating foreign ownership airline rules , if it saw through with its plans . in addition , deutsche post is buying airborne express 's u.s. ground services for $ 1.05 billion . dhl airways tried to defuse the dispute when it announced a u.s. investor group had purchased all the shares of the air carrier , thus putting it in the hands of u.s. share-holders .
however , the u.s. department of transportation is examining the case .
a decision is due in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on wednesday , klaus zumwinkel -lrb- photo -rrb- said he was optimistic .
" the group will be strengthening its involvement on the u.s. express market in the coming months and following the merger with airborne express , we will rise to be the number three in the world 's largest express market . " cutting costs zumwinkel , who has pushed through an ambitious € 1.4 billion savings plan aimed at nearly doubling group profits by 2005 , said the program 's € 174 million in half-year savings were higher than planned . deutsche post , he added , would post at least € 2.9 billion in operating profits in the full year , € 100 million more than expected .
as a result , full-year profit would come in just under that of 2002 , despite lower stamp prices which will result in € 300 million off profits this year . cuts in postage prices plus the continuing crisis in the press market both contributed to a fall in revenues from deutsche post 's classic mail services .
these were topped by revenues from deutsche post 's courier and express services which now form deutsche post 's leading unit , increasing by 2.7 percent to € 7.9 billion , in particular due to european business .
here , revenues grew by a record 4.4 percent , in particular in germany and spain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post to enter british letter-delivery market the german postal services giant deutsche post says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers .

the abundance of sun could just contribute to one of the best vintages europe has seen in years . while european farmers bemoan a summer of drought and plead with local governments and the european union to help them through the dry period , winegrowers and drinkers may be treated to one of the best years ever . " in the first half of 2003 we had a surplus of 340 sunshine hours compared to the average of past years , " ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , told dw-world .
" the conditions are wonderful at the moment . " to produce wine the grapes need to ripen in the sun .
it disintegrates disagreeable acids and enriches natural sugars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in northern wine growing regions , like germany , early ripening is helpful for a good vintage because the grapevines have more time to produce sugar in the grapes , and therefore the quality will be very good , " büscher explained . the abundance of sun in europe this summer has speeded up the process . throughout germany 's wine-producing regions the grapevines are two to three weeks further in their development than is normally the case .
in rheinhessen , one of germany 's traditional wine growing regions in the south of the country , grapevines have n't bloomed so early since 1934 , armin göring , the head of the german wine institute , told dpa news agency .
in württemberg there were no records of the vines ever having blossomed so early , he said . the benefits of drought drought does n't affect grapevines like it does other crops . " it 's not like grain , whose roots are near the surface , in the region of 30 centimeters .
wine is a taproot that goes 10 to 12 meters deep , straight down , " jürgen stumpf , whose family has a vineyard in franconia , in southern germany , told deutsche welle .
long after other crops have died of thirst , wine still has access to its water supply . but the vines can get too much sun too . " at the moment , -lsb- german -rsb- wine makers are waiting for rain , " ernst büscher explained .
" in some regions the conditions are quite critical because the supply of water is very low .
wine producers need some rain but not too much at once . " it 's not just that the grapes need water either .
" when it 's really hot the berries close down .
then they do n't develop more sugar , they turn off .
that 's why it does n't sometimes work when there 's too much sun .
in regions like la mancha in spain , for example , where there 's lots of sun , the wine is sometimes boring , " stumpf explained . and this summer it may just be too hot in places like southern france .
" but in these regions , like the mosel valley or the northern areas that normally get little sun , it 's brilliant . " but it takes a lot more to produce an excellent wine . " you need a good location .
you need a good vine variety .
you need someone who does it well .
you also need to have a feel for it .
everything must be just right , " stumpf pointed out . " the great wines grow in the north , where it 's difficult and the conditions are not so straightforward , " he said .
" it 's like with people : when they are under stress and constantly have to adapt to things they 're more lively .
that 's how it is with wine too . " do n't applaud , yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a german winegrowers ' saying goes , one should n't praise the wine before the autumn .
the summer of 2000 started out well in germany , but ruined wine experts ' hopes when it rained for three weeks straight . " but we 're going the right way , " stumpf conceded .
" the blossoming worked out ; we did n't need to spray .
there were few weeds and few damaging fungi .
the stock is very good and healthy .
that is , of course , a good basis for a good wine .

the enzyme helps proteins called tau support the network of nerve cells in the brain .
in healthy brains , the strands are part of a " scaffolding " system which supports the cells .
but in the brains of alzheimer 's patients , strands of protein bind together to develop tangles in the brain .
the researchers , from beth israel deaconess medical center and the harvard medical school , have discovered this tangling occurs because of a genetic fault in the gene which controls the enzyme , which is called pin1 .
the discovery could help prevent people developing alzheimer 's , they say .
knots in a healthy brain , phosphates are added and removed from tau .
but in alzheimer 's , too many phosphate molecules are added , so the protein changes shape and clusters into fibres .
it provides hope for people with alzheimer 's and their families dr susanne sorensen , alzheimer 's society these become tangled and knotted , forming rigid structures that eventually lead to the destruction of the affected nerve cells in certain areas of the brain , resulting in symptoms of dementia .
the us researchers compared pin1 expression in different areas of the brains in healthy people with those of alzheimer 's patients .
in alzheimer 's patients a faulty gene was linked to formation of the tau tangles , and in healthy patients it showed they were vulnerable to neurodegenerative disease .
they also created a genetically modified mouse which lacked the key gene .
the mouse then experienced many age-dependent neurodegenerative changes .
dr kun ping lu , the biologist who led the research , said : " we 've now shown that pin1 plays a pivotal role in protecting against age-dependent neurodegeneration .
" this makes a convincing case that this enzyme should be taken into consideration in future studies of alzheimer 's disease . "
he added : " pin1 represents a new category of genes whose expression is required to guard against age-dependent neurodegeneration .
" we now need to conduct further studies to explore why pin1 expression is low in certain vulnerable neurons , to understand the relationship between pin1 and other genes that are known to be involved in alzheimer 's disease , and to find ways to increase pin1 expression .
" answering these questions could lead to the development of therapies to prevent or slow age-dependent neurodegenerative processes . "
the researchers also found that pin1 works too hard in many human cancers .
they say this over-expression is critical for tumours to develop in the first place .
mechanism dr susanne sorensen , head of research at the uk 's alzheimer 's society , told bbc news online : " alzheimer 's disease is likely to be a multi-factorial disease with the involvement of more than one gene and disease causing mechanism .
" more research is needed to work out the mechanism for this particular enzyme 's action and to identify therapeutic targets .
she added : " this type of basic research on the causes of alzheimer 's disease is very important .
" it provides hope for people with alzheimer 's and their families that in the future it will be possible to treat the disease in earlier stages than is presently possible . "

the enzyme helps proteins called tau support the network of nerve cells in the brain .
in healthy brains , the strands are part of a " scaffolding " system which supports the cells .
but in the brains of alzheimer 's patients , strands of protein bind together to develop tangles in the brain .
the researchers , from beth israel deaconess medical center and the harvard medical school , have discovered this tangling occurs because of a genetic fault in the gene which controls the enzyme , which is called pin1 .
the discovery could help prevent people developing alzheimer 's , they say .
knots in a healthy brain , phosphates are added and removed from tau .
but in alzheimer 's , too many phosphate molecules are added , so the protein changes shape and clusters into fibres .
it provides hope for people with alzheimer 's and their families dr susanne sorensen , alzheimer 's society these become tangled and knotted , forming rigid structures that eventually lead to the destruction of the affected nerve cells in certain areas of the brain , resulting in symptoms of dementia .
the us researchers compared pin1 expression in different areas of the brains in healthy people with those of alzheimer 's patients .
in alzheimer 's patients a faulty gene was linked to formation of the tau tangles , and in healthy patients it showed they were vulnerable to neurodegenerative disease .
they also created a genetically modified mouse which lacked the key gene .
the mouse then experienced many age-dependent neurodegenerative changes .
dr kun ping lu , the biologist who led the research , said : " we 've now shown that pin1 plays a pivotal role in protecting against age-dependent neurodegeneration .
" this makes a convincing case that this enzyme should be taken into consideration in future studies of alzheimer 's disease . "
he added : " pin1 represents a new category of genes whose expression is required to guard against age-dependent neurodegeneration .
" we now need to conduct further studies to explore why pin1 expression is low in certain vulnerable neurons , to understand the relationship between pin1 and other genes that are known to be involved in alzheimer 's disease , and to find ways to increase pin1 expression .
" answering these questions could lead to the development of therapies to prevent or slow age-dependent neurodegenerative processes . "

the tribal areas have historically been autonomous , governed by tribal leaders and their own laws .
but pakistan is now trying to exert some control on a federal level .
it 's hard to imagine how the battery of 120 millimetre guns maintained by the soldiers on the border could be useful in the guerilla war currently being waged by the taleban just inside afghanistan .
but army commanders say that this is not the point .
the artillery is intended as proof of pakistan 's seriousness in fighting the war on terror on one of its few identifiable front lines .
making a difference " we have deployed our troops along the border , along all the entry points ... into pakistan from afghanistan , " explains lieutenant colonel zaffar iqbal at a briefing at a new military outpost near the khyber pass .
pakistan has spread thousands of troops along the 1,600-mile border .
and according to brigadier khadim hussain the troops are already having an effect .
" since the time that we have moved in we have sealed this border very effectively and we are not allowing any undesirable element into our area .
" if at all there is some undesirable element reported , he is nabbed right at the border .
there is nothing happening as far as we are concerned on our side , " the brigadier says confidently .
but many people say the border is so leaky that the taleban and their sympathisers have been able to regroup .
although the united states announced the end of major combat operations in afghanistan in may , attacks have spiralled in recent months .
the americans say extremists hit and then run back across the border into pakistan .
rahimullah yusufzai , a pakistani analyst , says that they are probably right .
" i know for sure that a number of these al-qaeda and taleban officials are hiding in pakistan , " he says .
" of the 500 al-qaeda fighters who were captured in pakistan , about 70 % were captured in this province - the tribal areas as well . "
soft tactics but the pakistanis have another weapon in their arsenal to get around this issue - development projects designed to win the hearts and minds of locals .
we have n't seen the taleban here but if they come near our homes we 'll teach them a lesson haji malang , tribal elder the army is helping to build schools , new electricity , water and road projects in the tribal areas .
pakistan says this is the key to winning public support and tapping into a formidable ground intelligence network .
tribal elders like haji malang , say they are grateful to the army .
" we have n't seen the taleban here but if they come near our homes we 'll teach them a lesson , " he says .
" we have no sympathy for them .
and do n't even talk about al-qaeda - we hate them . "
is bin laden dead ?
so could the key target of the war on terror , osama bin laden , head of the al-qaeda network , conceivably be in the tribal areas ?
rahimullah yusufzai believes it is possible .
" if he 's alive - and i think that he is alive , " he says , " he could be anywhere in the border areas of pakistan and afghanistan . "
" we know that he has a lot of support among the tribal people and also in the rest of pakistan . "

the tribal areas have historically been autonomous , governed by tribal leaders and their own laws .
but pakistan is now trying to exert some control on a federal level .
it 's hard to imagine how the battery of 120 millimetre guns maintained by the soldiers on the border could be useful in the guerilla war currently being waged by the taleban just inside afghanistan .
but army commanders say that this is not the point .
the artillery is intended as proof of pakistan 's seriousness in fighting the war on terror on one of its few identifiable front lines .
making a difference " we have deployed our troops along the border , along all the entry points ... into pakistan from afghanistan , " explains lieutenant colonel zaffar iqbal at a briefing at a new military outpost near the khyber pass .
pakistan has spread thousands of troops along the 1,600-mile border .
and according to brigadier khadim hussain the troops are already having an effect .
" since the time that we have moved in we have sealed this border very effectively and we are not allowing any undesirable element into our area .
" if at all there is some undesirable element reported , he is nabbed right at the border .
there is nothing happening as far as we are concerned on our side , " the brigadier says confidently .
but many people say the border is so leaky that the taleban and their sympathisers have been able to regroup .
although the united states announced the end of major combat operations in afghanistan in may , attacks have spiralled in recent months .
the americans say extremists hit and then run back across the border into pakistan .
rahimullah yusufzai , a pakistani analyst , says that they are probably right .
" i know for sure that a number of these al-qaeda and taleban officials are hiding in pakistan , " he says .
" of the 500 al-qaeda fighters who were captured in pakistan , about 70 % were captured in this province - the tribal areas as well . "
soft tactics but the pakistanis have another weapon in their arsenal to get around this issue - development projects designed to win the hearts and minds of locals . "
we have n't seen the taleban here but if they come near our homes we 'll teach them a lesson " haji malang , tribal elder the army is helping to build schools , new electricity , water and road projects in the tribal areas .
pakistan says this is the key to winning public support and tapping into a formidable ground intelligence network .
tribal elders like haji malang , say they are grateful to the army .
" we have n't seen the taleban here but if they come near our homes we 'll teach them a lesson , " he says .
" we have no sympathy for them .
and do n't even talk about al-qaeda - we hate them . "
is bin laden dead ?
so could the key target of the war on terror , osama bin laden , head of the al-qaeda network , conceivably be in the tribal areas ?
rahimullah yusufzai believes it is possible .
" if he 's alive - and i think that he is alive , " he says , " he could be anywhere in the border areas of pakistan and afghanistan . "
" we know that he has a lot of support among the tribal people and also in the rest of pakistan . "
if he is in pakistan he ca n't hide forever .
but the pressure is mounting to find him .
the longer he remains at large , the more damaging it is ultimately to washington 's objectives in the region .

residents of the city appear to have been voting in their hundreds to make sure hull tops a poll of places people are desperate to avoid calling their home .
it would seem to be a slap in the face for an area that was recently voted as one of the uk 's best cities to visit , ahead of the likes of liverpool , leeds and london .
city marketing chiefs do not believe the survey , which is the basis of a forthcoming book entitled " crap towns - the 50 worst places to live in the uk " - is an accurate reflection of opinion of their city . "
visitors placed us alongside london , liverpool and manchester - all thriving european cities and we 're up there with them " emma pearson-kendall , hull city image but disparaging remarks about its people , architecture and even aroma continue to pour in to a website compiling the comments for inclusion in the text .
contributors to the book claim hull 's " silent threat of violence " , its " boring landscape " and , bizarrely , " the smell of the chocolate factory " are reasons for slating the city .
publisher boxtree is staying tight-lipped on which area will be named the most hated in britain before its release in october .
but the book 's editors admit they will " be surprised if it is n't hull " .
a spokeswoman for the company told bbc news online : " it is fair to say hull is definitely in the top ten because of the overwhelming response from its dwellers .
she added : " it is people with serious gripes we are talking about . "
although boxtree insist all the submissions are from people who have lived and worked in hull , city marketing chiefs are taking the results with a pinch of salt .
emma pearson-kendall , of hull city image , told bbc news online : " because the poll is not very scientific its difficult to see where these people come from and where they live now .
" we found that people were talking about the city as it was - a lot of them seemed to be people who lived in the city a long time ago .
" the reality now is very different . "
those who consider hull their home are less restrained in dismissing the attack on their city .
good things about hull ...
kc stadium the deep old , distinctive phone boxes the humber bridge the waterfront one hull native told bbc news online : " i think it 's a very unjust reputation and most people who say these things have never even been here . "
millions of pounds have been invested in hull over the past ten years and the council is expecting a further £ 1bn investment over the next decade .
the city points to landmarks such as the kc stadium -lrb- home to the city 's football and rugby teams and the occasional elton john concert -rrb- , the marina and aquatic tourist attraction the deep as evidence of the city 's development .
ms pearson-kendall says hull is now a choice location for people to work , live and study in - as well as proving a hit amongst tourists .
' lots to offer ' in a recent survey conducted by the guardian and observer , hull was named as one of the top 15 city destinations in the uk .
she added : " things like this book actually really help in that people come and see for themselves .
" visitors placed us alongside london , liverpool and manchester - all thriving european cities and we 're up there with them .

residents of the city appear to have been voting in their hundreds to make sure hull tops a poll of places people are desperate to avoid calling their home .
it would seem to be a slap in the face for an area that was recently voted as one of the uk 's best cities to visit , ahead of the likes of liverpool , leeds and london .

residents of the city appear to have been voting in their hundreds to make sure hull tops a poll of places people are desperate to avoid calling their home .
it would seem to be a slap in the face for an area that was recently voted as one of the uk 's best cities to visit , ahead of the likes of liverpool , leeds and london .

residents of the city appear to have been voting in their hundreds to make sure hull tops a poll of places people are desperate to avoid calling their home .
it would seem to be a slap in the face for an area that was recently voted as one of the uk 's best cities to visit , ahead of the likes of liverpool , leeds and london .
city marketing chiefs do not believe the survey , which is the basis of a forthcoming book entitled " crap towns - the 50 worst places to live in the uk " - is an accurate reflection of opinion of their city .
visitors placed us alongside london , liverpool and manchester - all thriving european cities and we 're up there with them emma pearson-kendall , hull city image but disparaging remarks about its people , architecture and even aroma continue to pour in to a website compiling the comments for inclusion in the text .
contributors to the book claim hull 's " silent threat of violence " , its " boring landscape " and , bizarrely , " the smell of the chocolate factory " are reasons for slating the city .
publisher boxtree is staying tight-lipped on which area will be named the most hated in britain before its release in october .
but the book 's editors admit they will " be surprised if it is n't hull " .
a spokeswoman for the company told bbc news online : " it is fair to say hull is definitely in the top ten because of the overwhelming response from its dwellers .
she added : " it is people with serious gripes we are talking about . "
the deep has attracted more than one million visitors although boxtree insist all the submissions are from people who have lived and worked in hull , city marketing chiefs are taking the results with a pinch of salt .
emma pearson-kendall , of hull city image , told bbc news online : " because the poll is not very scientific its difficult to see where these people come from and where they live now .
" we found that people were talking about the city as it was - a lot of them seemed to be people who lived in the city a long time ago .
" the reality now is very different . "
those who consider hull their home are less restrained in dismissing the attack on their city .
good things about hull ...
kc stadium the deep old , distinctive phone boxes the humber bridge the waterfront one hull native told bbc news online : " i think it 's a very unjust reputation and most people who say these things have never even been here . "
millions of pounds have been invested in hull over the past ten years and the council is expecting a further £ 1bn investment over the next decade .
the city points to landmarks such as the kc stadium -lrb- home to the city 's football and rugby teams and the occasional elton john concert -rrb- , the marina and aquatic tourist attraction the deep as evidence of the city 's development .
ms pearson-kendall says hull is now a choice location for people to work , live and study in - as well as proving a hit amongst tourists .
' lots to offer ' in a recent survey conducted by the guardian and observer , hull was named as one of the top 15 city destinations in the uk .
she added : " things like this book actually really help in that people come and see for themselves .
" visitors placed us alongside london , liverpool and manchester - all thriving european cities and we 're up there with them .
" hundreds of thousands of visitors , investors in the city , students who study here and the people who live and work here ca n't all be wrong .
" we are not saying the city does n't have any problem issues - but what city does n't ? "

it is the first time northern constabulary has acted on such a matter and protesters said the move was significant .
northern constabulary took two weeks to read campaigner robbie the pict 's 39,000 word statement claiming that the tolling regime on the skye bridge was illegal .
the force , which has been accused of dismissing such complaints , has now passed the matter to the fiscal .
the skye bridge company , which collects the tolls , declined to comment on the move .
court case but the scottish executive said all challenges to the legality of the toll regime had been rejected to date and ministers did not expect that to change .
campaigners have previously taken their case through the scottish courts , but lost their challenge in 1999 .
four protesters argued that the toll collectors ' employers , miller civil engineering , had no lawful authority to collect the money for crossing without the written consent of the secretary of state .
but three judges hearing their appeal in edinburgh called their action " misconceived " .
robbie the pict was among the four campaigners who had been convicted of not paying the tolls .
tolls for crossing the bridge are currently set at £ 5.70 one-way for a car in the summer and £ 4.70 in the winter .

the welsh assembly government has been told it must urgently review the way it pays compensation .
the auditor general for wales , sir john bourn , said procedures for payments needed to be addressed .
farmers are supposed to receive the market value for an animal hit with tb , but last year 's payments of more than £ 8m were at least 50 % higher .
the report acknowledged that bovine tb was a serious problem for farmers in wales , with cases on the increase .
but analysis by the auditor general 's office showed valuations for cattle lost to the disease in 2002 were inconsistent with the market value and were considerably higher than those in devon and northern ireland . "
bovine tb is spreading at an alarming rate in wales " evan r thomas , fuw it said the assembly did not effectively monitor and regulate how animals were valued .
the report said a " secondary " market had emerged for tb compensation , which had " developed a dynamic of its own , where valuations had not reflected true market prices " .
it went on to state : " there are issues in this for all concerned in the process to address . "
' victim ' the farmers ' union of wales said compensation payments should not be significantly reduced until the government takes " decisive action " to wipe out the disease .
the fuw 's national tb forum representative evan r thomas said : " bovine tb is spreading at an alarming rate in wales .
" even if these payment changes are implemented , any immediate savings will be quickly wiped out by the ever-increasing number of herds that are falling victim to this dreadful disease . "
according to fuw figures , just under 5,000 animals were slaughtered in 2002 , with cases of the disease increasing by an average of 29 % per year from 1996 to 2002 .
it claimed restrictions on movement of livestock until the test cycle was completed had knock-on financial implications in addition to the loss of a particular animal .

education minister yunis qanooni described the allegations as part of a plot organised by political circles inside and outside afghanistan .
he said that he had always fought for human rights and spoken out against abusers .
in a report , human rights watch said that abuses were carried out by soldiers and police and condoned by senior figures in president hamid karzai 's government .
warlords backed by the united states were creating a climate of fear in afghanistan , it said , which could threaten next year 's elections .
the report camesa day after a provincial governor called on us-led coalition forces to mount military operations to target resurgent taleban forces .
grip on power human rights watch 's brad adams said the warlords had " hijacked " the country outside kabul .
" human rights abuses in afghanistan are being committed by gunmen and warlords who were propelled into power by the united states and its coalition partners after the taleban fell in 2001 , " he said .
" the united states and the united kingdom in particular need to decide whether they are with president karzai and other reformers in kabul or with the warlords . "
the longer they wait the more difficult it will be to loosen the warlords ' grip on power brad adams human rights watch a spokesman for mr karzai said the government was doing all it could to cut down on human rights abuses but said it was " a gigantic task " .
among the police and army abuses described in the report are kidnappings , burglaries , rapes and extortions .
the group also says political activists and journalists are being harassed , arrested and threatened with death by security officials .
the abuses are being carried out by police working under senior officials , including cabinet ministers and provincial governors , the report claims .
in some parts of the country , the atmosphere of intimidation means that women are not leaving their homes and girls are not going to school .
the continued threat of taleban forces is also causing concern in some areas .
six afghan policemen were killed in an ambush by suspected taleban and al-qaeda fighters in the helmand province on sunday .
new army fears of a taleban resurgence led the deputy governor of the southern zabol province to call on the us-led coalition for military support .
mullah mohammed omar , who shares his name with the ousted taleban leader , said the province 's own forces were unable to cope .
hundreds of taleban fighters were roaming freely in several districts , he said , intimidating government employees and supporters .
last week about 1,000 afghan national army soldiers - a fifth of its total trained manpower - were deployed along with us and italian troops in an operation aimed at tracking down the fighters .
elections are due to be held in afghanistan next year but the human rights watch report warns that if the situation does not improve the democratic process will be under threat .

mr blair , who said his appetite for power remained " undiminished " despite his recent troubles , said he understood the " very legitimate questions " to be asked over dr kelly 's death .
but , speaking during his monthly televised news conference , he said it was important to let the hutton inquiry into the affair run its course .
the prime minister , asked about labour 's relations with the bbc after reports that intelligence on iraq 's weapons was exaggerated , said all the government had wanted was to " correct an incorrect story " .
later , while rejecting calls for a wider independent inquiry into the case for war with iraq , he refused to be drawn on questions about whether he would resign if no weapons of mass destruction are found in iraq .
all we ever wanted was an incorrect story corrected tony blair blair announces more foundation hospitals progress on public service reform but he acknowledged the need to win public trust over the iraq war , saying : " i accept there is an issue that we have to confront . "
asked about comments by cabinet minister lord falconer that mr blair would lead labour into a third term in government , the prime minister said : " there is a big job of work to do - my appetite for doing it is undiminished .
who the country elects is ultimately for the country . "
he opened the news conference by hailing the government 's achievements as it approaches a " milestone " this weekend which sees it become the longest serving labour government of all time .
progress but he acknowledged that people needed to know what the government did during the war on iraq " was right " in order to secure their trust in ministers .
there has always been something bizarre about the notion that saddam never had any weapons of mass destruction tony blair blair news conference : key points mr blair announced the expansion of controversial proposals to give more hospitals foundation status and the chance to control their own budgets .
michael barber , the head of the downing street delivery unit , also gave a progress report on public service reform .
the inquiry into dr kelly 's death is due to open on friday , before being adjourned until after his funeral which is to be held next wednesday .
mr blair , who is believed to heading to barbados for a family holiday this week , has said he will do whatever lord hutton requires , including cutting short his holiday if needed .
kelly debate mr blair has already denied authorising the release of dr kelly 's name as the possible source behind a bbc story that the government had " sexed up " its september dossier on iraq 's weapons .
analysis : blair ducks the difficult questions during the news conference , the prime minister refused to be drawn again on that question .
and he also ducked questions about whether his director of communications , alastair campbell , was planning to quit .
but he said it was important to reflect on relations between politicians and the media once the hutton inquiry had finished its work .
mr blair replied : " i think there are issues there for both sides of the political culture and perhaps when the hutton inquiry has finalised its judgements and published those , that debate can take place in a more informed way .
" there are things for us both to reflect on . "
he added : " i think it is important that all of us , once the inquiry reports , learn the lessons of that . "
' bizarre ' mr blair said he did not believe an inquiry into the war on iraq was justified , but urged people to wait for reports from the iraqi survey group , a team of experts tasked with looking for evidence of weapons , before rushing to judgement .
he said he remained confident that the intelligence on saddam hussein 's weapons programmes received by the government was correct .
he said : " there has always been something bizarre about the notion that saddam never had any weapons of mass destruction . "
asked whether he wanted saddam dead or alive , he said : " i think the most important thing is that he ceases to be an obstacle to progress in iraq . "
mr blair also signalled his support for the introduction of identity cards in the uk .
but added : " however there are huge logistical and cost issues that need to be resolved .
" it 's worth looking , which is what we are doing , at how you can resolve them , but it 's not a quick-fix for the system , because of the amount of time and the logistical process in introducing them . "
' evaded ' the news conference came after mr blair 's deputy , john prescott , urged labour rebels to " shut up for the summer " amid the continuing rows over iraq .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said mr blair had " evaded " the key questions .
" but the central question on the hutton inquiry was not posed , " he added .
" that is : if lord hutton concludes that his limited remit has prevented him from fully investigating the circumstances leading to dr david kelly 's death will the prime minister then agree to set up a more wide-ranging independent inquiry , headed by a judge , into the events which led us going to war ? "
dr kelly 's body was found in woods near his oxfordshire home nearly two weeks ago - he had apparently committed suicide .
his death came after speculation , later confirmed by the bbc , that he was the source of stories that the government had " sexed up " an intelligence dossier on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
it was announced on wednesday that dr kelly 's funeral will take place on 6 august at st mary 's church in longworth , oxfordshire .
