a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert steinhäuser once the shock created by the massacre by robert steinhäuser -lrb- photo -rrb- had worn off , german leaders moved to tighten the country 's gun laws in june in an effort to prevent mass killings from occurring again .
these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert steinhäuser once the shock created by the massacre by robert steinhäuser -lrb- photo -rrb- had worn off , german leaders moved to tighten the country 's gun laws in june in an effort to prevent mass killings from occurring again .
these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .
but schily acknowledged that the government could only to do so much .

anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .

these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.04.2003 european central bank president expected to postpone retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg europe 's finance ministers are meeting in athens this weekend to determine the future of european central bank president wim duisenberg .
the results could postpone his early retirement . when he took the helm of the euro zone 's new central bank in 1998 , wim duisenberg knew he was n't likely to serve out his term . french politicians , eager to get something out of the deal after frankfurt was selected as the ecb 's headquarters , got germany and the rest of the 11 euro zone countries to agree to have duisenberg retire this summer , three years before his term offfically expired in 2006 . replacing him would be a frenchman : bank of france governor jean-claude trichet . but trichet has since been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the state-supported bank credit lyonnais .
he is charged with knowing about the bank ’ s misleading accounts while he was at the french finance ministry in the 1990s . trichet says the charges of complicity against him are groundless . he says he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . potentially messy succession with a verdict in the case expected only by june 18 , duisenberg ’ s scheduled departure on his 68th birthday on july 9 poses a potentially embarrassing situation should trichet be found guilty .
that has increased the likelihood that european union finance ministers will ask duisenberg to stay on at the ecb during a two-day summit in athens this weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duisenberg oversaw the introduction of the euro europe ’ s leaders are keen to avoid a messy succession at the ecb at a time of flagging euro-zone growth and as the war in iraq continues to create global economic uncertainty .
ecb officials are also concerned with maintaining the young bank ’ s reputation only four years after the introduction of the euro . duisenberg made clear this week the length of his extended stay wasn ’ t as important as ensuring continuity at the top of arguably the world ’ s second most important monetary authority after the u.s. federal reserve . “ a smooth transition can take a week , a month or two or three months .
but so long as the transition is smooth , the ecb council and i would be very satisfied , ” duisenberg said . victory for duisenberg but the whole incident amounts to a small victory for the no-nonsense dutchman , who never really hid the fact he would have preferred to serve out his whole eight years in office .
the compromise to shorten his tenure emerged after germany managed to get the ecb headquartered in frankfurt .
french president jacques chirac then only agreed to let duisenberg - the former governor of the dutch central bank - become president if he would step aside for paris ’ candidate trichet after a few years . “ as long as france isn ’ t completely closed to the idea , it would certainly be a triumph for duisenberg , ” said an e.u. official in brussels said on friday . should trichet be found guilty in the credit lyonnais case , he would clearly no longer be acceptable as ecb president .
extending duisenberg ’ s stay at the helm of the bank through at least the summer would give euro-zone politicians time to find a suitable replacement . former ecb vice president christian noyer and the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development jean lemierre are considered frontrunners to step in for trichet , since the are both french . duisenberg , once an avid golfer , is expected to move back to the netherlands after he retires . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank cuts interest rates european central bank cut rates for the second time since december in an attempt to revive the continent 's slumping economies .

but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .
but schily acknowledged that the government could only to do so much .

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert steinhäuser once the shock created by the massacre by robert steinhäuser -lrb- photo -rrb- had worn off , german leaders moved to tighten the country 's gun laws in june in an effort to prevent mass killings from occurring again .
these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .
but schily acknowledged that the government could only to do so much .

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert steinhäuser once the shock created by the massacre by robert steinhäuser -lrb- photo -rrb- had worn off , german leaders moved to tighten the country 's gun laws in june in an effort to prevent mass killings from occurring again .
these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .
but schily acknowledged that the government could only to do so much .
" there never was such a thing as 100 percent security , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the blame game after the debate on tightening gun laws , germany ’ s political establishment has predictably turned to the media to curb its dishing out of violence .
but not everybody is swallowing the media-violence link .

he is charged with knowing about the bank ’ s misleading accounts while he was at the french finance ministry in the 1990s . trichet says the charges of complicity against him are groundless . he says he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . potentially messy succession with a verdict in the case expected only by june 18 , duisenberg ’ s scheduled departure on his 68th birthday on july 9 poses a potentially embarrassing situation should trichet be found guilty .
that has increased the likelihood that european union finance ministers will ask duisenberg to stay on at the ecb during a two-day summit in athens this weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duisenberg oversaw the introduction of the euro europe ’ s leaders are keen to avoid a messy succession at the ecb at a time of flagging euro-zone growth and as the war in iraq continues to create global economic uncertainty .
ecb officials are also concerned with maintaining the young bank ’ s reputation only four years after the introduction of the euro . duisenberg made clear this week the length of his extended stay wasn ’ t as important as ensuring continuity at the top of arguably the world ’ s second most important monetary authority after the u.s. federal reserve . “ a smooth transition can take a week , a month or two or three months .
but so long as the transition is smooth , the ecb council and i would be very satisfied , ” duisenberg said . victory for duisenberg but the whole incident amounts to a small victory for the no-nonsense dutchman , who never really hid the fact he would have preferred to serve out his whole eight years in office .
the compromise to shorten his tenure emerged after germany managed to get the ecb headquartered in frankfurt .
french president jacques chirac then only agreed to let duisenberg - the former governor of the dutch central bank - become president if he would step aside for paris ’ candidate trichet after a few years . “ as long as france isn ’ t completely closed to the idea , it would certainly be a triumph for duisenberg , ” said an e.u. official in brussels said on friday . should trichet be found guilty in the credit lyonnais case , he would clearly no longer be acceptable as ecb president .
extending duisenberg ’ s stay at the helm of the bank through at least the summer would give euro-zone politicians time to find a suitable replacement . former ecb vice president christian noyer and the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development jean lemierre are considered frontrunners to step in for trichet , since the are both french . duisenberg , once an avid golfer , is expected to move back to the netherlands after he retires . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank cuts interest rates european central bank cut rates for the second time since december in an attempt to revive the continent 's slumping economies .

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .

these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert steinhäuser once the shock created by the massacre by robert steinhäuser -lrb- photo -rrb- had worn off , german leaders moved to tighten the country 's gun laws in june in an effort to prevent mass killings from occurring again .
these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .

the results could postpone his early retirement . when he took the helm of the euro zone 's new central bank in 1998 , wim duisenberg knew he was n't likely to serve out his term . french politicians , eager to get something out of the deal after frankfurt was selected as the ecb 's headquarters , got germany and the rest of the 11 euro zone countries to agree to have duisenberg retire this summer , three years before his term offfically expired in 2006 . replacing him would be a frenchman : bank of france governor jean-claude trichet . but trichet has since been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the state-supported bank credit lyonnais .
he is charged with knowing about the bank ’ s misleading accounts while he was at the french finance ministry in the 1990s . trichet says the charges of complicity against him are groundless . he says he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . potentially messy succession with a verdict in the case expected only by june 18 , duisenberg ’ s scheduled departure on his 68th birthday on july 9 poses a potentially embarrassing situation should trichet be found guilty .
that has increased the likelihood that european union finance ministers will ask duisenberg to stay on at the ecb during a two-day summit in athens this weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duisenberg oversaw the introduction of the euro europe ’ s leaders are keen to avoid a messy succession at the ecb at a time of flagging euro-zone growth and as the war in iraq continues to create global economic uncertainty .
ecb officials are also concerned with maintaining the young bank ’ s reputation only four years after the introduction of the euro . duisenberg made clear this week the length of his extended stay wasn ’ t as important as ensuring continuity at the top of arguably the world ’ s second most important monetary authority after the u.s. federal reserve . “ a smooth transition can take a week , a month or two or three months .
but so long as the transition is smooth , the ecb council and i would be very satisfied , ” duisenberg said . victory for duisenberg but the whole incident amounts to a small victory for the no-nonsense dutchman , who never really hid the fact he would have preferred to serve out his whole eight years in office .
the compromise to shorten his tenure emerged after germany managed to get the ecb headquartered in frankfurt .
french president jacques chirac then only agreed to let duisenberg - the former governor of the dutch central bank - become president if he would step aside for paris ’ candidate trichet after a few years . “ as long as france isn ’ t completely closed to the idea , it would certainly be a triumph for duisenberg , ” said an e.u. official in brussels said on friday . should trichet be found guilty in the credit lyonnais case , he would clearly no longer be acceptable as ecb president .
extending duisenberg ’ s stay at the helm of the bank through at least the summer would give euro-zone politicians time to find a suitable replacement . former ecb vice president christian noyer and the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development jean lemierre are considered frontrunners to step in for trichet , since the are both french . duisenberg , once an avid golfer , is expected to move back to the netherlands after he retires . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank cuts interest rates european central bank cut rates for the second time since december in an attempt to revive the continent 's slumping economies .

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert steinhäuser once the shock created by the massacre by robert steinhäuser -lrb- photo -rrb- had worn off , german leaders moved to tighten the country 's gun laws in june in an effort to prevent mass killings from occurring again .
these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .
but schily acknowledged that the government could only to do so much .

the results could postpone his early retirement . when he took the helm of the euro zone 's new central bank in 1998 , wim duisenberg knew he was n't likely to serve out his term . french politicians , eager to get something out of the deal after frankfurt was selected as the ecb 's headquarters , got germany and the rest of the 11 euro zone countries to agree to have duisenberg retire this summer , three years before his term offfically expired in 2006 . replacing him would be a frenchman : bank of france governor jean-claude trichet . but trichet has since been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the state-supported bank credit lyonnais .
he is charged with knowing about the bank ’ s misleading accounts while he was at the french finance ministry in the 1990s . trichet says the charges of complicity against him are groundless . he says he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . potentially messy succession with a verdict in the case expected only by june 18 , duisenberg ’ s scheduled departure on his 68th birthday on july 9 poses a potentially embarrassing situation should trichet be found guilty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.04.2003 european central bank president expected to postpone retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president wim duisenberg europe 's finance ministers are meeting in athens this weekend to determine the future of european central bank president wim duisenberg .
the results could postpone his early retirement . when he took the helm of the euro zone 's new central bank in 1998 , wim duisenberg knew he was n't likely to serve out his term . french politicians , eager to get something out of the deal after frankfurt was selected as the ecb 's headquarters , got germany and the rest of the 11 euro zone countries to agree to have duisenberg retire this summer , three years before his term offfically expired in 2006 . replacing him would be a frenchman : bank of france governor jean-claude trichet . but trichet has since been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the state-supported bank credit lyonnais .
he is charged with knowing about the bank ’ s misleading accounts while he was at the french finance ministry in the 1990s . trichet says the charges of complicity against him are groundless . he says he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . potentially messy succession with a verdict in the case expected only by june 18 , duisenberg ’ s scheduled departure on his 68th birthday on july 9 poses a potentially embarrassing situation should trichet be found guilty .
that has increased the likelihood that european union finance ministers will ask duisenberg to stay on at the ecb during a two-day summit in athens this weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duisenberg oversaw the introduction of the euro europe ’ s leaders are keen to avoid a messy succession at the ecb at a time of flagging euro-zone growth and as the war in iraq continues to create global economic uncertainty .
ecb officials are also concerned with maintaining the young bank ’ s reputation only four years after the introduction of the euro . duisenberg made clear this week the length of his extended stay wasn ’ t as important as ensuring continuity at the top of arguably the world ’ s second most important monetary authority after the u.s. federal reserve . “ a smooth transition can take a week , a month or two or three months .
but so long as the transition is smooth , the ecb council and i would be very satisfied , ” duisenberg said . victory for duisenberg but the whole incident amounts to a small victory for the no-nonsense dutchman , who never really hid the fact he would have preferred to serve out his whole eight years in office .
the compromise to shorten his tenure emerged after germany managed to get the ecb headquartered in frankfurt .
french president jacques chirac then only agreed to let duisenberg - the former governor of the dutch central bank - become president if he would step aside for paris ’ candidate trichet after a few years . “ as long as france isn ’ t completely closed to the idea , it would certainly be a triumph for duisenberg , ” said an e.u. official in brussels said on friday . should trichet be found guilty in the credit lyonnais case , he would clearly no longer be acceptable as ecb president .

a year after a fatal school shooting , germany raised the legal age of many guns from 18 to 25 this week .
but critics maintain the government should focus its efforts on stamping out illegal gun ownership . the 19-year-old killer came wearing a black mask , and carrying a glock 17 pistol and a mossberg 590 pump-action shotgun .
by the time he had finished his rampage at a high school in erfurt last april , he had fired off 40 rounds of ammunition and killed 16 people - 13 teachers , two students and one police officer .
with police closing in , the expelled student then killed himself and ended one of germany 's worst crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert steinhäuser once the shock created by the massacre by robert steinhäuser -lrb- photo -rrb- had worn off , german leaders moved to tighten the country 's gun laws in june in an effort to prevent mass killings from occurring again .
these changes took effect on tuesday .
german interior minister otto schily said they would provide " more legal protection , more controls and more supervision " of gun ownership in the country .
but other officials are not so certain that the law will achieve schily 's goals .
the new law is designed to curb gun ownership of young people .
it raises the minimum age for ownership of sporting guns from 18 to 21 and for hunting weapons from 16 to 18 .
anyone younger than 25 must have a certificate of " mental capability to own weapons " unless he or she is a registered hunter or sports shooter .
former minister raises questions christian pfeiffer , a former justice minister in the german state of lower saxony , is one of the new law 's skeptics .
" the gun law , i think , will not lead to a major reduction in gun crimes in germany because someone who is determined to commit a crime will continue to pay € 500 or more , sometimes less , in some dive for an illegal weapon and then will carry out his illegal business , " pfeiffer said .
wolfgang dicke , a specialist in weapons law with the german police union , also said he doubted the new law would be effective .
" if you want to stop gun crime , then legal ownership of guns is not the issue , " dicke said .
to back up his view , he said that in 1999 only 10 percent of the 1,000 guns seized by police were legally owned .
despite the severity of the rampage in erfurt , the number of gun crimes in germany has fallen in recent years .
in 2001 , the number of cases in which a firearm was shot fell 21.9 percent from the previous year to a total of 5,416 incidents .
the number of killings committed with firearms also fell 13.3 percent to 298 .
looking for ways to prevent crimes pfeiffer suggested that officials had to go beyond tougher laws if they wanted to stop crimes like the one which took place in erfurt .
" the decisive factor - which has not been addressed yet or addressed enough - is : how do you stop people from conjuring up these evil crimes ?
how do you prevent a fascination with weapons , the creation of a macho culture linked to weapons ?
what has to be done in terms of the media , for instance ? " he said .
the german government took one step in this direction on tuesday , establishing a commission that will work to protect children and adolescents from violence in television and on the internet .

the aid package is in response to complaints from airlines that the iraqi war was causing an unprecedented collapse in ticket sales , at a time when major carriers were already weak .

the scottish executive has granted a special nature conservation order -lrb- snco -rrb- covering the sands east of the forth rail bridge , including the area around burntisland .
scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- had become concerned over the impact of a rise in cockle fishing .
snh requested an snco be granted to prevent cockle collecting , other than for personal or scientific use .
in 2002 several groups of people started commercial cockle fishing at burntisland and this soon escalated into a major cockle fishing operation .
damage fears the firth of forth is a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- and a european special protection area -lrb- spa -rrb- for birds .
snh advised the executive that an unregulated commercial cockle fishery , on the scale that was seen at burntisland , could damage bird populations for which the spa is classified .
many species of birds , such as oystercatcher , feed on cockles .
uncertainty over the stocks of cockles meant it was not possible to clearly define what would constitute a sustainable fishery .
the snco now prohibits commercial cockling while not restricting local people 's rights to small scale cockling , a low level of which is unlikely to affect the internationally important bird populations .
it stretches east from the bridge as far as dunbar on the south side and to elie on the fife side .
while the snco is in place snh hopes to gain more information about cockle stocks in the area and will look at the possibility for a sustainable fishery management scheme to be put in place .

it is thought one of the reasons for the decline could be fears about false allegations of abuse against children .
one teaching union says it has dealt with more than 1,500 allegations against its members - but just a handful have resulted in convictions .
concern is growing that - while men are turning away from the primary sector - children could be missing out on valuable male role models .
in 1993 , just over 21.5 % of all staff working in primary schools were male , but this had dropped to 19.6 % four years later .
new figures for last year have shown that ratio dropped again , to just over 18 % .
in april last year , a similar shortage of men signing up to become primary school teachers in england was tackled by an advertising campaign .
convictions many in the profession have said worries about false allegations of abuse could be behind the decline .
according to the teaching union , the nasuwt -lrb- national association of schoolmasters union of women teachers -rrb- there have been 1,557 police investigations against members .
but of those , just 62 have resulted in convictions .
two years ago , cardiff headteacher john tobutt was accused of physically assaulting a boy twice in three months .
investigations by the police and social services found that there was no case to answer , and he was cleared .
in april 2001 , mr tobutt told a nasuwt conference that teachers falsely accused by pupils should be compensated by the state .
he told bbc wales : " there are a number of colleagues up and down the country who have gone through similar experiences and they have been permanently damaged and will probably never get over such an experience . "
