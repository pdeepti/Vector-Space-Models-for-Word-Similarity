amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .
" whatever their status , we have made clear our view that the detainees are entitled to humane treatment and , if prosecuted , a fair trial , " it report said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.10.2003 the consumer 's can nightmare continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does n't look convinced : environmental minister trittin the " can deposit , " introduced in january to a sceptical public and an incensed business world , has led to confusion in households and stores nationwide .
an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .
if they wanted their deposit back after draining the can 's contents they had to return to the same store where they bought it , produce the can and the token , receipt or slip of paper , and only then could they get their 25 or 50 cents back . changing habits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans learned to retain and return their cans just like they had done ages ago with their reusable glass and plastic bottles .
but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .
a break to stock up on liquids at an autobahn rest stop cost an additional 25 cents for people whose journey prevented them from returning with the empty recepticle and the token , receipt or slip of paper . irritated consumers forced to rummage around for proof of purchase for cans have had their hopes pinned on october 1 .
the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .
actually there are at least three collection systems running parallel to each other .
trittin has predicted that market forces would reduce them to one system in the long-run . " ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .
that does n't concern minister trittin though , since the whole point of the can deposit was to strengthen the already existing environmentally-friendly system for reusable bottles . but the can deposit 's opponents are adamantly against the new system .
" most " companies have decided not to sell cans because they did n't think investing in a collection system would pay off , a german retailers association spokesman hubertus pellingahr told german broadcaster zdf .
the deposit is like " a ban on the can , " he said . but this may not be the end of the story . the european commission gave germany until october 1 to set up the nationwide collection system .
if it decides the system puts european union drinks manufacturers at a disadvantage on the german market when it examines the issue in late october minister trittin may have to make changes and the can deposits opponents may yet find satisfaction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german can deposit saga incurs eu ’ s wrath germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly .

an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .
if they wanted their deposit back after draining the can 's contents they had to return to the same store where they bought it , produce the can and the token , receipt or slip of paper , and only then could they get their 25 or 50 cents back . changing habits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans learned to retain and return their cans just like they had done ages ago with their reusable glass and plastic bottles .
but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .
a break to stock up on liquids at an autobahn rest stop cost an additional 25 cents for people whose journey prevented them from returning with the empty recepticle and the token , receipt or slip of paper . irritated consumers forced to rummage around for proof of purchase for cans have had their hopes pinned on october 1 .
the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .
actually there are at least three collection systems running parallel to each other .
trittin has predicted that market forces would reduce them to one system in the long-run . " ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .
that does n't concern minister trittin though , since the whole point of the can deposit was to strengthen the already existing environmentally-friendly system for reusable bottles . but the can deposit 's opponents are adamantly against the new system .
" most " companies have decided not to sell cans because they did n't think investing in a collection system would pay off , a german retailers association spokesman hubertus pellingahr told german broadcaster zdf .
the deposit is like " a ban on the can , " he said . but this may not be the end of the story . the european commission gave germany until october 1 to set up the nationwide collection system .
if it decides the system puts european union drinks manufacturers at a disadvantage on the german market when it examines the issue in late october minister trittin may have to make changes and the can deposits opponents may yet find satisfaction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german can deposit saga incurs eu ’ s wrath germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 .
the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .
an acronym for small missions for advanced research and technology , the smart 1 is the first european spacecraft to be driven by solar-powered electric propulsion .
until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .
it 's lighter load means it is capable of carrying more scientific instruments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2003 europe criticizes treatment of prisoners in guantanamo bay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camp x-ray at guantanamo bay a group of european parliament members has urged the european union to step up pressure on the u.s. to ensure fair treatment of guantanamo bay prisoners , in particular 20 eu citizens . the horror of guantanamo bay , a u.s. naval base in cuba converted into a military prison camp for al qaeda and taliban suspects , reared its ugly head in the european parliament in brussels on tuesday when a group of parliamentarians heard testimony from relatives and legal representatives of 20 european citizens imprisoned there .
amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .
" whatever their status , we have made clear our view that the detainees are entitled to humane treatment and , if prosecuted , a fair trial , " it report said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

“ we unfortunately expect further reductions in retail this year .
it should be similar to the year before and will also hit employment , ” hermann franzen , the president of the hde german retailing association , said on wednesday .
franzen said there were the first signs of an improving outlook for retailers after three years of stagnation in the sector .
but data released on wednesday for the industry remained grim : the federal statistics office said german retail sales unexpectedly slipped for the third month in four in august , as hot weather and holidays kept consumers away from the stores .
sales fell 0.2 percent from july and dropped 4.9 percent from august 2002 . more briefs 01.10.2003 -pipe- commission slaps hoechst with fine for price-fixing 01.10.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn could slash 37,000 jobs 30.09.2003 -pipe- adidas hopes on a better 2004 in the u.s. 30.09.2003 -pipe- ford in germany announces layoffs 30.09.2003 -pipe- eu court upholds bans on grants to vw 29.09.2003 -pipe- consumer climate remains poor 29.09.2003 -pipe- postbank to go public in autumn 2004 29.09.2003 -pipe- publisher 's confidant to buy paper amid row radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 .
the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .
an acronym for small missions for advanced research and technology , the smart 1 is the first european spacecraft to be driven by solar-powered electric propulsion .
until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .
it 's lighter load means it is capable of carrying more scientific instruments .
esa plans a third launch , rosetta , is planned in february 2004 , to visit comet churyumov-gerasimenko . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches mars express probe the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.10.2003 study finds bleak answer to german income question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts blame falling net incomes for poor consumer spending in germany .
the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .

an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .
if they wanted their deposit back after draining the can 's contents they had to return to the same store where they bought it , produce the can and the token , receipt or slip of paper , and only then could they get their 25 or 50 cents back . changing habits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans learned to retain and return their cans just like they had done ages ago with their reusable glass and plastic bottles .
but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .
a break to stock up on liquids at an autobahn rest stop cost an additional 25 cents for people whose journey prevented them from returning with the empty recepticle and the token , receipt or slip of paper . irritated consumers forced to rummage around for proof of purchase for cans have had their hopes pinned on october 1 .
the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .
actually there are at least three collection systems running parallel to each other .
trittin has predicted that market forces would reduce them to one system in the long-run . " ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .
that does n't concern minister trittin though , since the whole point of the can deposit was to strengthen the already existing environmentally-friendly system for reusable bottles . but the can deposit 's opponents are adamantly against the new system .
" most " companies have decided not to sell cans because they did n't think investing in a collection system would pay off , a german retailers association spokesman hubertus pellingahr told german broadcaster zdf .
the deposit is like " a ban on the can , " he said . but this may not be the end of the story . the european commission gave germany until october 1 to set up the nationwide collection system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.10.2003 schröder links " political fate " to reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder gets serious in the face of internal opposition .
german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .
“ in the coming votes , where the opposition has already said they ’ re against them , it will determine the survival of the coalition .
he needs to keep his power dry for that , ” professor ulrich von alemann at the heinrich-heine university in düsseldorf told german ard television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller unfortunately for schröder , some mps have already announced they will oppose the next reforms unless there are changes .
and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .
“ if we can reasonably and rationally explain it all and possibly even improve things here or there then we ’ ll have a unified parliamentary group . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves massive healthcare reforms the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .

german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .

and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2003 europe criticizes treatment of prisoners in guantanamo bay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camp x-ray at guantanamo bay a group of european parliament members has urged the european union to step up pressure on the u.s. to ensure fair treatment of guantanamo bay prisoners , in particular 20 eu citizens . the horror of guantanamo bay , a u.s. naval base in cuba converted into a military prison camp for al qaeda and taliban suspects , reared its ugly head in the european parliament in brussels on tuesday when a group of parliamentarians heard testimony from relatives and legal representatives of 20 european citizens imprisoned there .
amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .

amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.10.2003 study finds bleak answer to german income question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts blame falling net incomes for poor consumer spending in germany .
the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2003 europe criticizes treatment of prisoners in guantanamo bay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camp x-ray at guantanamo bay a group of european parliament members has urged the european union to step up pressure on the u.s. to ensure fair treatment of guantanamo bay prisoners , in particular 20 eu citizens . the horror of guantanamo bay , a u.s. naval base in cuba converted into a military prison camp for al qaeda and taliban suspects , reared its ugly head in the european parliament in brussels on tuesday when a group of parliamentarians heard testimony from relatives and legal representatives of 20 european citizens imprisoned there .
amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .

amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .

and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .

an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .
if they wanted their deposit back after draining the can 's contents they had to return to the same store where they bought it , produce the can and the token , receipt or slip of paper , and only then could they get their 25 or 50 cents back . changing habits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans learned to retain and return their cans just like they had done ages ago with their reusable glass and plastic bottles .
but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .
a break to stock up on liquids at an autobahn rest stop cost an additional 25 cents for people whose journey prevented them from returning with the empty recepticle and the token , receipt or slip of paper . irritated consumers forced to rummage around for proof of purchase for cans have had their hopes pinned on october 1 .
the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .

trittin has predicted that market forces would reduce them to one system in the long-run . " ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .
that does n't concern minister trittin though , since the whole point of the can deposit was to strengthen the already existing environmentally-friendly system for reusable bottles . but the can deposit 's opponents are adamantly against the new system .
" most " companies have decided not to sell cans because they did n't think investing in a collection system would pay off , a german retailers association spokesman hubertus pellingahr told german broadcaster zdf .
the deposit is like " a ban on the can , " he said . but this may not be the end of the story . the european commission gave germany until october 1 to set up the nationwide collection system .

if they wanted their deposit back after draining the can 's contents they had to return to the same store where they bought it , produce the can and the token , receipt or slip of paper , and only then could they get their 25 or 50 cents back . changing habits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans learned to retain and return their cans just like they had done ages ago with their reusable glass and plastic bottles .
but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .
a break to stock up on liquids at an autobahn rest stop cost an additional 25 cents for people whose journey prevented them from returning with the empty recepticle and the token , receipt or slip of paper . irritated consumers forced to rummage around for proof of purchase for cans have had their hopes pinned on october 1 .
the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .
actually there are at least three collection systems running parallel to each other .
trittin has predicted that market forces would reduce them to one system in the long-run . " ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .
that does n't concern minister trittin though , since the whole point of the can deposit was to strengthen the already existing environmentally-friendly system for reusable bottles . but the can deposit 's opponents are adamantly against the new system .
" most " companies have decided not to sell cans because they did n't think investing in a collection system would pay off , a german retailers association spokesman hubertus pellingahr told german broadcaster zdf .
the deposit is like " a ban on the can , " he said . but this may not be the end of the story . the european commission gave germany until october 1 to set up the nationwide collection system .
if it decides the system puts european union drinks manufacturers at a disadvantage on the german market when it examines the issue in late october minister trittin may have to make changes and the can deposits opponents may yet find satisfaction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german can deposit saga incurs eu ’ s wrath germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

-lrb- september 4 , 2003 -rrb- germany debates sanctioning the unemployed german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .

the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .

until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 .
the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .
an acronym for small missions for advanced research and technology , the smart 1 is the first european spacecraft to be driven by solar-powered electric propulsion .
until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .
it 's lighter load means it is capable of carrying more scientific instruments .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.10.2003 study finds bleak answer to german income question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts blame falling net incomes for poor consumer spending in germany .
the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 .
the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .
an acronym for small missions for advanced research and technology , the smart 1 is the first european spacecraft to be driven by solar-powered electric propulsion .
until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .
it 's lighter load means it is capable of carrying more scientific instruments .
esa plans a third launch , rosetta , is planned in february 2004 , to visit comet churyumov-gerasimenko . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches mars express probe the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2003 europe criticizes treatment of prisoners in guantanamo bay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camp x-ray at guantanamo bay a group of european parliament members has urged the european union to step up pressure on the u.s. to ensure fair treatment of guantanamo bay prisoners , in particular 20 eu citizens . the horror of guantanamo bay , a u.s. naval base in cuba converted into a military prison camp for al qaeda and taliban suspects , reared its ugly head in the european parliament in brussels on tuesday when a group of parliamentarians heard testimony from relatives and legal representatives of 20 european citizens imprisoned there .
amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .

and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .

an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .
if they wanted their deposit back after draining the can 's contents they had to return to the same store where they bought it , produce the can and the token , receipt or slip of paper , and only then could they get their 25 or 50 cents back . changing habits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans learned to retain and return their cans just like they had done ages ago with their reusable glass and plastic bottles .
but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .
a break to stock up on liquids at an autobahn rest stop cost an additional 25 cents for people whose journey prevented them from returning with the empty recepticle and the token , receipt or slip of paper . irritated consumers forced to rummage around for proof of purchase for cans have had their hopes pinned on october 1 .
the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .
actually there are at least three collection systems running parallel to each other .
trittin has predicted that market forces would reduce them to one system in the long-run . " ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .
that does n't concern minister trittin though , since the whole point of the can deposit was to strengthen the already existing environmentally-friendly system for reusable bottles . but the can deposit 's opponents are adamantly against the new system .
" most " companies have decided not to sell cans because they did n't think investing in a collection system would pay off , a german retailers association spokesman hubertus pellingahr told german broadcaster zdf .
the deposit is like " a ban on the can , " he said . but this may not be the end of the story . the european commission gave germany until october 1 to set up the nationwide collection system .

gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .

minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.10.2003 key meeting sheds light on german space program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men on mars ?
space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 .
the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .
an acronym for small missions for advanced research and technology , the smart 1 is the first european spacecraft to be driven by solar-powered electric propulsion .
until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .
it 's lighter load means it is capable of carrying more scientific instruments .
esa plans a third launch , rosetta , is planned in february 2004 , to visit comet churyumov-gerasimenko . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches mars express probe the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions .

an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .
if they wanted their deposit back after draining the can 's contents they had to return to the same store where they bought it , produce the can and the token , receipt or slip of paper , and only then could they get their 25 or 50 cents back . changing habits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans learned to retain and return their cans just like they had done ages ago with their reusable glass and plastic bottles .
but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .
a break to stock up on liquids at an autobahn rest stop cost an additional 25 cents for people whose journey prevented them from returning with the empty recepticle and the token , receipt or slip of paper . irritated consumers forced to rummage around for proof of purchase for cans have had their hopes pinned on october 1 .
the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .
actually there are at least three collection systems running parallel to each other .
trittin has predicted that market forces would reduce them to one system in the long-run . " ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .

german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .

and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .

but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .

that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .

amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .

amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .

" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.10.2003 schröder links " political fate " to reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder gets serious in the face of internal opposition .
german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .
“ in the coming votes , where the opposition has already said they ’ re against them , it will determine the survival of the coalition .
he needs to keep his power dry for that , ” professor ulrich von alemann at the heinrich-heine university in düsseldorf told german ard television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller unfortunately for schröder , some mps have already announced they will oppose the next reforms unless there are changes .
and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .
“ if we can reasonably and rationally explain it all and possibly even improve things here or there then we ’ ll have a unified parliamentary group . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves massive healthcare reforms the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .

the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 .
the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .
an acronym for small missions for advanced research and technology , the smart 1 is the first european spacecraft to be driven by solar-powered electric propulsion .
until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .
it 's lighter load means it is capable of carrying more scientific instruments .
esa plans a third launch , rosetta , is planned in february 2004 , to visit comet churyumov-gerasimenko . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches mars express probe the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions .

german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .
“ in the coming votes , where the opposition has already said they ’ re against them , it will determine the survival of the coalition .
he needs to keep his power dry for that , ” professor ulrich von alemann at the heinrich-heine university in düsseldorf told german ard television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller unfortunately for schröder , some mps have already announced they will oppose the next reforms unless there are changes .
and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .

“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .
“ in the coming votes , where the opposition has already said they ’ re against them , it will determine the survival of the coalition .
he needs to keep his power dry for that , ” professor ulrich von alemann at the heinrich-heine university in düsseldorf told german ard television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller unfortunately for schröder , some mps have already announced they will oppose the next reforms unless there are changes .
and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2003 europe criticizes treatment of prisoners in guantanamo bay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : camp x-ray at guantanamo bay a group of european parliament members has urged the european union to step up pressure on the u.s. to ensure fair treatment of guantanamo bay prisoners , in particular 20 eu citizens . the horror of guantanamo bay , a u.s. naval base in cuba converted into a military prison camp for al qaeda and taliban suspects , reared its ugly head in the european parliament in brussels on tuesday when a group of parliamentarians heard testimony from relatives and legal representatives of 20 european citizens imprisoned there .
amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .

amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .

amzat begg made an impassioned plea for his 35-year-old son , a british citizen , detained two years ago in pakistan and since held at camp delta in guantanamo bay .
" i know for sure moazzam has not done anything wrong , " begg said .
" it ’ s a gross violation of human rights which has been committed by america . "
the guantanamo bay prison camp -lrb- photo -rrb- , which holds some 680 men from 42 countries - most taken into custody in afghanistan following the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the united states - has come under fire from human rights groups and civil organizations worldwide for holding the prisoners without charge and denying them free and fair trials . washington insists on trying the men by secret military tribunals instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban and al-qaida detainees at guantanamo bay the issue is further complicated with the bush administration classifying the men as " illegal combatants , " meaning they are neither soldiers - in which case they would be treated in accordance with the geneva convention - nor common criminals , in which case they would face trial by jury in a u.s. criminal court .
meps : eu should protest unitedly a cross-party group of european parliament members have now added their voice to the growing clamor of criticism and petitioned the european union to push for a jury trial or release for 20 eu citizens currently being held at guantanamo bay , among them nine british nationals , three british residents who do not hold a u.k. passport , six french citizens and a german-born man of turkish descent .
" i 'm personally hearing a deafening silence from the eu as an entity , " british liberal democrat deputy sarah ludford said on tuesday at a news conference in brussels .
" where is the united diplomatic protest by the eu to president bush ? ...
i think it is our duty to tell president bush and defense secretary donald rumsfeld ... that the u.s. is shooting itself in the foot with human rights abuses at guantanamo bay . "
ludford further suggested the eu should make its support of a broader united nations mandate in iraq conditional on washington giving european prisoners held in camp delta a fair trial .
" the u.s. wants a un security council resolution on internationalizing the occupation of iraq , " she said .
" we have a window of opportunity there .
we should say ' no way ' to president bush , unless we get guarantees of fair trials or release for those detainees . "
stepping up legal pressure on the u.s. monica frassoni , joint chair of the environmentalist green group in the european parliament called for suspension , if necessary , of agreements signed in june with the u.s. on legal cooperation and extradition .
" if no just solution is found for the problems of the detainees in guantanamo , these agreements must not come into force on the agreed date , may 1 , 2004 , " she said .
" the eu has taken similar measures against other countries .
why not against the united states ? "
spanish socialist deputy anna terron i cusi said the hearings were designed to motivate the european commission into looking out for its citizens and said the european parliament cross-party group would ask the eu 's decision-making council of ministers for support in presenting " a common front vis a vis the united states , to see that those people who are european citizens do have a fair trial and everybody else as well . "
terron i cusi underlined that since most of the citizens are of non-european descent , the case would be a test of the eu ’ s commitment to its constitutional – as opposed to ethnic – concept of citizenship .
britain moves to ensure fate of citizens european governments have largely shied away from confronting the u.s. on the matter .
so far only the u.k. and australia – and , to a lesser extent , sweden have raised concerted concerns about their citizens being held in the camps .
british prime minister tony blair , a close ally of the u.s. , intervened last month to urge the u.s. to make clear the fate of british prisoners being held at guantanamo bay .
" the uk government has consistently pressed the us administration to come to a decision on resolving the position of all the uk detainees held in guantanamo bay , " a recent foreign office report said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.10.2003 schröder links " political fate " to reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder gets serious in the face of internal opposition .
german chancellor gerhard schröder raised the stakes against rebel left-wing backbenchers in his own party this week , saying he was linking his “ political fate ” with his planned package of welfare and economic reforms . on friday , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens passed sweeping reforms to germany ’ s health care system .
but six left-wing spd parliamentarians voted against the legislation – nearly robbing the government of its own so-called “ chancellor ” majority . with a number of highly contentious reform bills still to be passed by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , schröder on tuesday explicitly said the future and success of his government would be measured on whether it managed to overhaul the country ’ s bloated welfare system and moribund economy . “ i want to consciously tie my political fate to the implementation of these reforms , ” schröder said in a speech at the german academy of sciences in berlin .
“ if we do n't do it by christmas , i fear we will never do it . ” many of the spd rebels accuse schröder of betraying the party ’ s roots by pushing reforms that will effectively trim the welfare state , lower taxes and scale back pensions .
they also blame the reform course for pushing the spd to new lows in opinion polls and routing the party in a number of state elections . stagnant economy but in light of germany ’ s stagnant growth and chronically high unemployment , schröder has decided he has no alternative other than to push forward with his so-called ‘ agenda 2010 ’ reform package . schröder likely hopes his rhetoric will encourage the left-wing backbenchers to toe the government ’ s line .
however , the move is a calculated gamble by the chancellor , since other reforms yet to be brought before parliament are even more controversial than the health care legislation . the next key vote will come on october 17 , when bills trimming unemployment and welfare benefits reaches the floor .
since the heath reforms plans were co-sponsored by the opposition conservatives , there was never any doubt that the legislation would pass .
but from here on out , the ruling coalition will be counting on every one of its mps to back the government . upping the ante some observers believe schröder may have raised the political ante too far too fast with his latest comments .
“ in the coming votes , where the opposition has already said they ’ re against them , it will determine the survival of the coalition .
he needs to keep his power dry for that , ” professor ulrich von alemann at the heinrich-heine university in düsseldorf told german ard television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller unfortunately for schröder , some mps have already announced they will oppose the next reforms unless there are changes .
and perhaps more ominously , it appears that resistance could come from schröder ’ s junior coalition partner the greens as well as his own spd backbenchers .
that could increase pressure on the chancellor to water-down his agenda 2010 . “ we won ’ t change the agenda 2010 , but rather modify it in a few points , ” the leader of left-wing spd parliamentarians michael müller said on wednesday .
“ if we can reasonably and rationally explain it all and possibly even improve things here or there then we ’ ll have a unified parliamentary group . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves massive healthcare reforms the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .

space experts asked the question .
the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program . once a year , international space experts get together to discuss and compare current projects and study results .
this year , a key focus was on the feasibility of a manned mission to mars .
the 54th international astronautical congress , which ends on october 5 , brings together 2,500 experts from 38 countries , including top brass from nasa and the general director of the russian air and space agency .
some 1,200 speeches , symposia and question-and-answer sessions broach topics as diverse as the use of aerospace technology in developing countries , signs of life in the universe and the international space station , or iss .
the hottest topic this year : is a manned trip to the red planet a utopian ideal , or an imminent reality ?
one thing the scientists agree on is that such a project is technologically feasible .
the uses , costs and opportunities of such a trip are a subject for a number of the symposia .
for instance , one discussion addresses the advances that would need to be made in telemedicine .
life on mars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express spacecraft an unmanned european mission to the planet – the mars-express – left earth in june under the aegis of esa , the european space agency , and is scheduled to reach mars in december .
its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileosat , the european civilian satellite-based navigation system .
while germany 's space sector suffers mainly from the financial difficulties in the telecommunications market , she said she hopes the experimental navigation satellite galileo , to be launched in late 2004 , will pump new life into german space-exploration .
smart is ambitious despite its relatively small budget and short development schedule , mars express is one illustration of europe 's ambitions in the exploration of the solar system .
another is the launch of the smart-1 unmanned moon probe last weekend .
the moon launch saw an ariane rocket blast off from the kourou launch center in french guyana early sunday morning , carrying an unmanned smart 1 probe into space .
the solar-powered craft is due to reach the moon at the end of next year , a test run for later flights to the outer limits of the solar system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 .
the 370 kilo , € 110 million probe is designed to test new types of space technology .

until now , rockets have been powered by fuel-burning cells .
the new ion drives accelerate more slowly than chemical rockets , but they can also last years longer .
the vessel ’ s lighter weight also offers an advantage over traditional fuel-burning rockets .

its goal is to answer questions such as : was there ever water on mars ?
are there signs of life there ?
the director of the german air and space agency , or dlr , berndt feuerbacher , hopes that answering thse questions will interest more than just academics .
germans ' interest in space exploration " leaves much to be desired , " he says – a fact that is reflected in his agency 's funding .
the dlr , with some 5,000 employees , has an annual budget of approximately € 1 billion a year .
nasa 's annual budget is more than 15 times as great .
if a mission discovered signs of life on mars , feuerbacher says , it would no doubt wake the public 's interest .
the problem with funding space exploration is that it requires very long term thinking , he notes .
speaking at the opening of the bremen conference , federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said she expects savings from the government 's planned social reforms to free up more funding for space programs .
big hopes for galileo discoveries made in space research form the ground for economic development and create jobs , in addition to serving the good of mankind , she noted .
therefore , europe should work hard to become a competitive and dynamic leader in the area of space exploration .
she cited a recent government move that gathered various projects under one national program as a step in the right direction for germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.10.2003 study finds bleak answer to german income question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts blame falling net incomes for poor consumer spending in germany .
the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little relief in sight for ailing german labor market german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago .
-lrb- september 4 , 2003 -rrb- germany debates sanctioning the unemployed german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed . it may not be the forbes list of germany ’ s super rich , but the country ’ s latest income report issued by the federal statistics office on tuesday allows a peek into the living standards of ordinary germans .
the glimpse , however , is far from reassuring and ties into a raging debate about the need to reform the labor market .
the study , which surveyed 27,000 companies hiring about 900,000 workers nationwide , found that the average gross salary in germany for employees in industry , trade , credit and insurance sectors is € 2,835 -lrb- $ 3,320 -rrb- per month .
though that ’ s an increase by 16 percent since 1995 when the last federal income survey was conducted , adjusted against inflation , the rise in income amounts to seven percent , while productivity for the same period climbed by almost nine percent .
in other words , germans have been working more for less money .
growing east-west gulf in income levels that wasn ’ t the only disheartening news that the income report contained .
over a decade after reunification , the gulf between income levels from the former communist east and the west has widened further at a record 30 percent , the study stressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economically depressed east .
gross wages among employees in the economically-depressed eastern half of the country averaged € 2047 , contrasted with € 2,937 in western germany .
the figures are based on full-time employees in trade , industrial and insurance sectors .
johann hahlen , president of the federal statistics office said the reasons for the income disparities between the east and the west chiefly had to do with the varying types of employees in both regions – more people in eastern germany worked at blue-collar jobs as compared with the west and blue-collar workers earn less than white-collar ones .
more women workers in the east hahlen also pointed out that that eastern germany had a much higher percentage of working women , and women - whether in the east or the west - earn much less than men .
the study underlines that though gross salaries of women have risen by 20 percent since 1995 - much faster than those of men - they still earn 22 percent less than their male colleagues .
" it ’ s well known that women often take up typically female professions , which pay less , " hahlen said udo ludwig , economics expert at the institute for economic research in halle said though many trade unions had pushed for bringing incomes in the east in line with those in the richer western part of the country , the majority of companies weren ’ t following the collective wage agreements .
ludwig told german daily berliner zeitung , the companies were either raising wages only marginally , or not at all – a fact that was reflected in the harsh economic realities and low productivity in eastern germany .
rising social contributions choking growth the study came to a further bleak conclusion that soaring non-wage labor costs were eating a large chunk of gross salaries and reining in consumer spending .
the federal statistics office said that while real net income had climbed by six percent in western germany since 1995 , it had risen by just 3.6 percent in the eastern half .
net incomes in western germany sank from 69 to 65.1 percent of gross income between 1990 and 1995 , in october 2001 it fell further to 64.7 percent .
the study underscored that at the same time , employee social security contributions rose from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 18.7 percent in october 2001 – a trend that has remained static since .
board member of the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- heinz putzhammer , put things in perspective .
" the stagnation of the real net income is the central reason for germany ’ s sluggish economic growth , " he stressed .
" without rising consumer spending , companies won ’ t have their hands full with contracts , there will be no economic growth and no progress in tackling unemployment .

an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .

but that system was undoubtedly better , since the bottles could be returned to any shop and no proof of purchase was required to get the deposit back .
now the routine trip to the supermarket was preceded by the hunt for the token , receipt or slip of paper that corresponded to the right empty can . thirsty vacationers too were plagued by the can deposit during one of the hottest summers in living memory .

the deal hammered out between the can deposit 's opponents and environmental minister jürgen trittin required a nationwide collection system to be in operation by that date which would allow consumers to return one-way bottles and cans to any shop that sold them . the time has come .
on day one , proponents of the can deposit have been positive .
minister trittin said things were n't chaotic .
" on the whole it works well , " the environmental protection organization deutsche umwelthilfe said after it had tested the new system .

" ban on the can " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upshot of it all has been that german consumers buy fewer single-use cans and bottles and some retailers have stopped stocking them at all .

an end to the stress may be in sight . a collective - if inaudible - sigh of relief should have gone through the german consumer world on wednesday .
but on the cut-off date , october 1 , they are still holding their breath , waiting to see if their woes will come to an end after all .
for german consumers have been plagued by a unique problem created by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental minister .
it goes by the name of the " can deposit " and consumers hoped it would have been consigned to the rubbish tip by the end of september . lauded by advocates of environmental protection , the can deposit requires retailers to charge consumers a 25 to 50 cent deposit on drinks in one-way packaging .
its opponents fought it to the bitter end , losing one legal case after another in numerous german courts .
finally the constitutional court , germany 's highest judicial power , quashed the pleas from retailers and the drinks industry on the eve of the can deposit 's introduction . then , on january 1 , 2003 , being a consumer in germany got more complicated .
gone were the days of carelessly chucking one 's beer can into the trash .
the ordeal agreed on by the drinks industry , retailers and the environmental ministry meant that buying a can of beer or a pet bottle of soda in the shop was no longer a simple transaction . instead of choosing a drink , paying for it and sauntering away to quench their thirst , german consumers paid the extra deposit and received a token or a receipt or a slip of paper along with the newly-purchased can .

group captain steve hillier , station commander at raf lossiemouth , said : " obviously the station will be sad to lose such an important unit .
" the move is the most cost-effective option to provide improved accommodation which will guarantee the future support of a vital , life-saving capability . "
the squadron responds to an average of 250 emergency call-outs each year .
raf kinloss is already home to the aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre , a nimrod squadron and the raf 's busiest mountain rescue team .
' economic sense ' group captain garfield porter , the station commander , said : " we are delighted to welcome the helicopters here .
" it makes both practical and economic sense and they will be a real asset to this station , completing our portfolio of air , land and sea rescue assets . "
up to 60 air crew and ground staff will be involved in the move .
the squadron has been based at lossiemouth since 1972 .
its two sea king helicopters have attended more than 5,000 incidents in scotland and beyond during that time .
the scottish mountains and maritime incidents account for the largest proportion of call-outs .

the currency has again risen , hitting 111.25 yen in the us dollar despite intervention by the bank of japan to push it back down .
the rise was driven by a positive report from the tankan survey of japanese business sentiment , showing confidence at a three-year high .
" the appreciation of the currency and of improved stock prices simply reflect the improved prospects of the economy going forward , " goldman sachs economist kathy matsui told bbc world business report .
but policy makers worry that a persistently strong yen - which has risen by more than 20 since the beginning of last year - could cripple any export-led recovery for the struggling japanese economy .
in september , the bank of japan sold yen worth almost $ 40bn in an attempt to constrain the currency , and was selling heavily on the overnight currency markets .
strangled at birth japan 's economy , heavily oriented towards exports , is vulnerable to exchange rates , and economists argue that a weak yen would be the best way for it to escape recession .
click here to see the dollar 's ups and downs against 24 other currencies but the government 's hopes of keeping the yen at 130 or so in the dollar have been hampered by signs that japan 's corporate sector is starting to recover - a trend that boosts the stock market and brings foreign investment into the country , keeping the currency buoyant .
" fundamentals dictating the direction of the yen continue to point to strength rather than weakness , " ms matsui said .
there is now concern that any long hoped-for recovery could be choked off quickly by exchange rates .
mr tanigaki , appointed only last month by prime minister junichiro koizumi , and whose views on the currency have not yet been fully spelled out , has now said he will pursue the interventionist policies of his predecessor .
this is despite a call at last month 's g7 meeting for rates to be set by market forces , an announcement that many said was aimed at japan .
drawing a line according to traders , the bank of japan has set 110 yen as its maximum dollar rate , a level that it will defend with all the resources at its disposal .
but markets are usually able to defeat even the most implacable central bank intervention , and there have previously been reports that the bank had spent all the funds it had set aside for supporting the dollar .
elsewhere in asia , too , there is concern over exchange rates .
the us dollar on wednesday hit a five-and-a-half-year low against the australian currency , leading to fears there that exports may suffer .
in india , less reliant on earnings from exports , it hit a three-year low against the rupee .
and china is coming under pressure to liberalise its exchange rates , after us concern that its yuan is artificially undervalued against the dollar .

around 100 jobs look set to be lost at the amlwch plant after the company announced on tuesday that it intends to shut the site .
the great lakes chemical corporation , formerly known as octel , has been in the town for 50 years , and is one of the world 's leading producer of certain speciality chemicals for applications like water treatment .
management say the factory can not compete with israeli and jordanian businesses , which can extract bromine more cheaply from sea water than can be done on anglesey .
the meeting will be held in llangefni on the island , but at this stage it seems unlikely that the factory will be saved .
anglesey council is expected to press the welsh assembly government for financial help in coping with such a major jobs blow in an isolated community .
site manager brian macconnachie said : " these steps are being taken after a careful review of operational costs , increased competitive pressures and market conditions .
" our employees have worked hard over the years to try to make the plant as efficient and productive as possible .
" despite our efforts , the amlwch site remains uncompetitive . "
the company said employee discussions were expected to begin within the next 30 days and would be concluded as quickly as possible in accordance with british employment legislation .
the firm 's only other site in britain is in manchester .

around 100 jobs look set to be lost at the amlwch plant after the company announced on tuesday that it intends to shut the site .
the great lakes chemical corporation , formerly known as octel , has been in the town for 50 years , and is one of the world 's leading producer of certain speciality chemicals for applications like water treatment .
management say the factory can not compete with israeli and jordanian businesses , which can extract bromine more cheaply from sea water than can be done on anglesey .
the meeting will be held in llangefni on the island , but at this stage it seems unlikely that the factory will be saved .
anglesey council is expected to press the welsh assembly government for financial help in coping with such a major jobs blow in an isolated community .
site manager brian macconnachie said : " these steps are being taken after a careful review of operational costs , increased competitive pressures and market conditions .
" our employees have worked hard over the years to try to make the plant as efficient and productive as possible .
" despite our efforts , the amlwch site remains uncompetitive . "
the company said employee discussions were expected to begin within the next 30 days and would be concluded as quickly as possible in accordance with british employment legislation .
the firm 's only other site in britain is in manchester .

the company , which had originally hoped to attract seven million subscribers by the end of this year , said its subscriber base had reached 7,015,000 on tuesday this week .
outgoing bskyb chief executive tony ball said reaching the milestone early was a " fantastic achievement . "
" when we set the seven million target over three years ago it was way ahead of market expectations , " he said .
" i congratulate the excellent team that has made it possible . "
the company is now aiming to increase its total subscriber base to eight million by the end of 2005 .
it also wants to boost average revenue per user to £ 400 , up from £ 366 in june this year .
happy birthday bskyb 's latest subscriber numbers come as the firm celebrates the fifth anniversary of the launch of its digital tv service .
the firm began to attract a mass audience four years ago through a high-risk strategy of giving away the set-top boxes and minidishes needed to decode digital television signals .
since then , the company 's subcriber base has grown strongly year-on-year , helped in part by its exclusive deal to screen football matches between the elite english premier league clubs .
the latest figures underline the firm 's achievements under chief executive tony ball , who is stepping down after more than four years in the top job .
james murdoch - head of asian satellite broadcaster star tv , and son of bskyb chairman rupert murdoch - is tipped as a strong contender for mr ball 's job .
potential successors to mr ball will be nominated to the bskyb board by a committee led by bskyb 's senior non-executive director , lord st john of fawsley .
bskyb shares were 1.5 % higher at 624p in early trade in london .

it has been ordered by the scarborough , whitby and ryedale primary care trust .
concerns about radiation followed a bbc inside out television documentary which reported possible cancer clusters near a similar early warning base at cape cod in the us .
the ministry of defence is currently planning to upgrade the fylingdales radar to make it part of the american missile defence system dubbed " son of star wars " .
death rates deaths by cancer in the 1990s in the area around fylingdales will now be compared with the whole of north yorkshire as well as england and wales .
the study will attempt to establish whether death rates are higher or lower than elsewhere .
the ministry of defence says there is no evidence to suggest a health risk from raf fylingdales .
it says emissions from the radar are many times lower than the safe levels set by the national radiological protection board .
earlier this week , it became known that officials at the north york moors national park have concluded that the upgrade of the base does not need planning permission .
