forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .
or at least , casually available .
all the singles will be holding identical purple baskets , so the idea is that you identify each other and make contact .
effectively , it means there will be a lot of checking out going on inside the store as well as at the cash register . yogurt and your phone number as silly as the plan sounds to some , with an estimated there are 600,000 single people in the french capital , there appears to be plenty of demand .
the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .
so he was quite enthusiastic about the idea of meeting real-life women in a real-life environment . “ i 'm here to flirt .
or trying to flirt , meet women .
i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .
with the night meaning brisk business for lafayette gourmet , singles can even ring up their shopping at a cash register reserved for them .
and if you do happen to meet someone interesting , you can have a drink together at a happy hour located in the drinks section of the store . the bar area is nestled between the bottles of vintage wine and 12-year-old whiskey and on singles night , it 's buy one drink , get one free .
perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .
if the company is happy with the results it will make the event permanent and will consider bringing the concept to stores around the country .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .

forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.10.2003 the german cult of michael moore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore : taking aim at the bush administration and the european market .
the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ?

effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .

the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .

i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .

perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.10.2003 the german cult of michael moore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael moore : taking aim at the bush administration and the european market .
the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .

in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .

" in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism .

kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .

forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .
or at least , casually available .
all the singles will be holding identical purple baskets , so the idea is that you identify each other and make contact .
effectively , it means there will be a lot of checking out going on inside the store as well as at the cash register . yogurt and your phone number as silly as the plan sounds to some , with an estimated there are 600,000 single people in the french capital , there appears to be plenty of demand .
the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .
so he was quite enthusiastic about the idea of meeting real-life women in a real-life environment . “ i 'm here to flirt .
or trying to flirt , meet women .
i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .
with the night meaning brisk business for lafayette gourmet , singles can even ring up their shopping at a cash register reserved for them .
and if you do happen to meet someone interesting , you can have a drink together at a happy hour located in the drinks section of the store . the bar area is nestled between the bottles of vintage wine and 12-year-old whiskey and on singles night , it 's buy one drink , get one free .
perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .
if the company is happy with the results it will make the event permanent and will consider bringing the concept to stores around the country .
that could mean fewer french singles have to go home alone ... or hungry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech supermarket offers looks into the future german shops aren ’ t normally known for being in the vanguard of global retailing .
but the country ’ s largest retailer , metro , is hoping to change things with a new supermarket of the future filled with techno gadgets .

forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .
or at least , casually available .
all the singles will be holding identical purple baskets , so the idea is that you identify each other and make contact .
effectively , it means there will be a lot of checking out going on inside the store as well as at the cash register . yogurt and your phone number as silly as the plan sounds to some , with an estimated there are 600,000 single people in the french capital , there appears to be plenty of demand .
the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .
so he was quite enthusiastic about the idea of meeting real-life women in a real-life environment . “ i 'm here to flirt .
or trying to flirt , meet women .
i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .
with the night meaning brisk business for lafayette gourmet , singles can even ring up their shopping at a cash register reserved for them .
and if you do happen to meet someone interesting , you can have a drink together at a happy hour located in the drinks section of the store . the bar area is nestled between the bottles of vintage wine and 12-year-old whiskey and on singles night , it 's buy one drink , get one free .
perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .
if the company is happy with the results it will make the event permanent and will consider bringing the concept to stores around the country .
that could mean fewer french singles have to go home alone ... or hungry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech supermarket offers looks into the future german shops aren ’ t normally known for being in the vanguard of global retailing .
but the country ’ s largest retailer , metro , is hoping to change things with a new supermarket of the future filled with techno gadgets .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism .

kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice .

forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .
or at least , casually available .
all the singles will be holding identical purple baskets , so the idea is that you identify each other and make contact .
effectively , it means there will be a lot of checking out going on inside the store as well as at the cash register . yogurt and your phone number as silly as the plan sounds to some , with an estimated there are 600,000 single people in the french capital , there appears to be plenty of demand .
the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .
so he was quite enthusiastic about the idea of meeting real-life women in a real-life environment . “ i 'm here to flirt .
or trying to flirt , meet women .
i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .
with the night meaning brisk business for lafayette gourmet , singles can even ring up their shopping at a cash register reserved for them .
and if you do happen to meet someone interesting , you can have a drink together at a happy hour located in the drinks section of the store . the bar area is nestled between the bottles of vintage wine and 12-year-old whiskey and on singles night , it 's buy one drink , get one free .
perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .
if the company is happy with the results it will make the event permanent and will consider bringing the concept to stores around the country .
that could mean fewer french singles have to go home alone ... or hungry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech supermarket offers looks into the future german shops aren ’ t normally known for being in the vanguard of global retailing .
but the country ’ s largest retailer , metro , is hoping to change things with a new supermarket of the future filled with techno gadgets .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .

" in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .

forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .
or at least , casually available .
all the singles will be holding identical purple baskets , so the idea is that you identify each other and make contact .
effectively , it means there will be a lot of checking out going on inside the store as well as at the cash register . yogurt and your phone number as silly as the plan sounds to some , with an estimated there are 600,000 single people in the french capital , there appears to be plenty of demand .
the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .
so he was quite enthusiastic about the idea of meeting real-life women in a real-life environment . “ i 'm here to flirt .
or trying to flirt , meet women .
i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .
with the night meaning brisk business for lafayette gourmet , singles can even ring up their shopping at a cash register reserved for them .
and if you do happen to meet someone interesting , you can have a drink together at a happy hour located in the drinks section of the store . the bar area is nestled between the bottles of vintage wine and 12-year-old whiskey and on singles night , it 's buy one drink , get one free .
perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .
if the company is happy with the results it will make the event permanent and will consider bringing the concept to stores around the country .
that could mean fewer french singles have to go home alone ... or hungry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech supermarket offers looks into the future german shops aren ’ t normally known for being in the vanguard of global retailing .
but the country ’ s largest retailer , metro , is hoping to change things with a new supermarket of the future filled with techno gadgets .

forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .
or at least , casually available .
all the singles will be holding identical purple baskets , so the idea is that you identify each other and make contact .
effectively , it means there will be a lot of checking out going on inside the store as well as at the cash register . yogurt and your phone number as silly as the plan sounds to some , with an estimated there are 600,000 single people in the french capital , there appears to be plenty of demand .
the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .
so he was quite enthusiastic about the idea of meeting real-life women in a real-life environment . “ i 'm here to flirt .
or trying to flirt , meet women .
i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .
with the night meaning brisk business for lafayette gourmet , singles can even ring up their shopping at a cash register reserved for them .
and if you do happen to meet someone interesting , you can have a drink together at a happy hour located in the drinks section of the store . the bar area is nestled between the bottles of vintage wine and 12-year-old whiskey and on singles night , it 's buy one drink , get one free .
perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .
if the company is happy with the results it will make the event permanent and will consider bringing the concept to stores around the country .
that could mean fewer french singles have to go home alone ... or hungry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech supermarket offers looks into the future german shops aren ’ t normally known for being in the vanguard of global retailing .
but the country ’ s largest retailer , metro , is hoping to change things with a new supermarket of the future filled with techno gadgets .

forget the lonely hearts column in the local paper .
after telephone and internet dating , there 's a new service for singles in france .
now you can find mr. or ms. right while doing your shopping at the supermarket . ah , the romance of paris .
love is around ever corner in the city of lights and now , you can even run into it while reaching for yogurt and stocking up on pasta .
aiming to play matchmaker , or at least help the lonely find each other , a french supermarket has begun organizing a singles ' night every thursday evening . lafayette gourmet , a high-end grocery story in paris , is testing out the concept with an event sponsored by internet company yahoo france .
yann motte , the company 's director of products and services , said it 's a very efficient way to spend one 's evening .
effectively killing two birds with one stone , so to speak . “ as you know there are many singles who are looking for other people .
if they work a lot or have a busy life , they may not meet as many people as they would like to , ” motte told deutsche welle .
“ on the other hand , they have to do shopping .
so why not make shopping , which is a bit of a dull activity , something a little more fun , a little more friendly ? ” the concept is pretty simple .
you show up and take a purple shopping basket .
and then you supposedly do your shopping as you normally would .
you go through the aisles .
pick up some juice , maybe some tomatoes and try to look casual .
or at least , casually available .
all the singles will be holding identical purple baskets , so the idea is that you identify each other and make contact .
effectively , it means there will be a lot of checking out going on inside the store as well as at the cash register . yogurt and your phone number as silly as the plan sounds to some , with an estimated there are 600,000 single people in the french capital , there appears to be plenty of demand .
the 28 year-old jerome , for example , has tried internet dating but he was frustrated by the fact you ca n't see the person or talk naturally .
so he was quite enthusiastic about the idea of meeting real-life women in a real-life environment . “ i 'm here to flirt .
or trying to flirt , meet women .
i think i read about this in the paper and in a magazine , cosmopolitan i think , ” he said .
although he had items in his basket he admitted , however , that he didn ’ t really need to shop .
instead the food was merely cover : “ i actually went shopping three days ago , but i could n't just walk around with an empty basket ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping sure works up a thirst .
with the night meaning brisk business for lafayette gourmet , singles can even ring up their shopping at a cash register reserved for them .
and if you do happen to meet someone interesting , you can have a drink together at a happy hour located in the drinks section of the store . the bar area is nestled between the bottles of vintage wine and 12-year-old whiskey and on singles night , it 's buy one drink , get one free .
perhaps most importantly , the unflattering florescent lights of the dairy section are far , far away . lafayette gourmet will continue with the single nights until december .
if the company is happy with the results it will make the event permanent and will consider bringing the concept to stores around the country .

the books and films of left-wing american political gadfly and cultural critic michael moore are incredibly popular with germans disenchanted with the united states .
dw-world explores the teutonic fascination with moore . it 's probably safe to say that few countries have embraced the work of american author and documentary filmmaker michael moore as feverishly and enthusiastically as has germany . his diatribe against u.s. president george bush stupid white men sold nearly 1.1 million copies in german – comprising an astonishing one-third of the book ’ s total global sales .
compare that with the 630,000 copies he sold in the united states , with its far larger population and you can begin to see why industry magazine publisher ’ s weekly compared his popularity here to that of comedian jerry lewis in france . moore in germany is nothing less than a media force bordering on cult .
during the first two months after its release , over 500,000 germans braved the winter cold to see moore ’ s oscar-winning film " bowling for columbine . "
his second book here , the german translation of 1997 's downsize this , celebrated a print run of 100,000 .
meanwhile , advanced sales of his new book , dude , where ’ s my country have already placed him at slot 18 on amazon.de , and moore ’ s publisher is planning a 200,000-copy first run , a rarity for non-fiction books in germany . so where ’ s the attraction ?
and how does germans ’ appreciation for moore differ from that of americans ? feeding stereotypes " his film and books feed negative stereotypes in germany and the traditional belief by many here that the country is uncultured , money grubbing , materialistic , superficial and that they run around with a gun in their hands , " said tom clark , an assistant professor of history at the university of kassel . however , clark noted , that much of the irony and self-reflection appreciated by american readers is lost in the transatlantic crossing .
" moore works in a different context in germany than in the states , " clark said .
though his books are seen as a sort of " rambunctious comedy , " they also lose much of the nuance caught by americans . those differences in perception are also apparent in the book ’ s german marketing .
in the united states moore ’ s book is sold under the title " stupid white men ... and other sorry excuses for the state of the union . "
in germany , loosely translated , it ’ s called " stupid white men – settling the score with america under bush . " anti-american sentiment sentiment against american politics isn ’ t anything new in germany .
washington ’ s popularity took a nose-dive here during the vietnam war and at the time the united states installed pershing missiles along the west german border .
but clark sees a new development in moore ’ s rise in the post-9/11 era . " of course the immediate trigger was the iraq war , but there are other factors , too , " he explained .
" germans now are very insecure about their own identity , " he explained .
" there ’ s challenging european unity , an economic crisis and an identity crisis here in germany .
everything is up for grabs and someone like moore is just offering a release .
he gives them something to protest against . " in clark ’ s opinion , moore appears to fill a political vacuum in germany , where politics are often taken dead serious and american-style tongue-in-cheek pundits like al franken or tough-talking conservative radio show host rush limbaugh are almost non-existent .
" as some journalists have pointed out , wouldn ’ t germans love to have their own michael moore ? "
german late-night talk show host harald schmidt comes closest , but he tends to take kid-glove shots at all sides and shies away from endorsing a single political ideology . moore ’ s popularity in germany also reflects the current attraction in germany to books that are critical of the united states and its policies .
his books join a handful of others with themes critical of the u.s. on germany ’ s best-seller list .
among them is andreas von bülow ’ s the cia and the 11th of september , a conspiracy-theory packed tome that , along with other gems , questions the veracity of u.s. claims that a hijacked 9/11 jet crashed in a pennsylvania field .
both books , published by the piper verlag publishing company , reached the top 10 bestseller ’ s list here . shoddy research just as critics here have eviscerated von bülow ’ s widely discredited sept .
11 theories , literary critics and professors alike in germany have taken moore to task for what they have dismissed as shoddy research - though it would be wrong to place the american writer in the same category as von bülow , germany 's former minister of technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrian kreye , a new york-based journalist who writes for munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung described a tendency in moore to " undermine his own points with bad research and that makes him vulnerable to criticism . "
though his work seems more solid in film and television , the fact that " he has done either too little or sloppy research first really comes across when you read him in black and white . " nor does kreye spare moore ’ s german fan base .
kreye believes moore ’ s popularity here is a reflection of often-knee jerk anti-american biases in many germans .
the problem with moore 's popularity in germany is that readers express their own anti-american feelings by quoting his books , which he sees as a form of cowardice . " german readers feel safe regurgitating anti-americanism so long as it 's an american who says it first , " kreye said . despite the barrage of criticism from many corners in germany , moore 's star continues to rise here . in light of the advance sales of dude , where ’ s my country , he ’ ll likely be able to fill sporting arenas when he arrives here for his november book tour . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .

the state 's attorney general , bill lockyer , brought the case against pw marketing of los angeles county and its owners , paul willis and claudia griffin in 2002 , under a 1998 state anti-spam law .
the law was strengthened last month to make it easier to sue spammers .
pw marketing , willis and griffin were charged with sending out millions of e-mails , including advertising $ 39 guides on how to spam , along with long lists of e-mail addresses of california residents .
computer tapping prosecutors said pw marketing violated the 1998 anti-spam law because these unsolicited e-mails were sent without a free call number for recipients to phone to stop additional mailings .
they also failed to follow state requirements to include a valid return address .
the state attorney , bill lockyer , also said the owners illegally tapped into computer users ' network connections so the company could send e-mails that could not be traced back to its source .
the judgement , which mr lockyer said will be the model for future spam injunctions , forbids pw marketing from sending unsolicited commercial e-mails , accessing computers that belong to other people without their permission and disguising its identity by sending messages that appear to originate from a different address .

the state 's attorney general , bill lockyer , brought the case against pw marketing of los angeles county and its owners , paul willis and claudia griffin in 2002 , under a 1998 state anti-spam law .
the law was strengthened last month to make it easier to sue spammers .
pw marketing , willis and griffin were charged with sending out millions of e-mails , including advertising $ 39 guides on how to spam , along with long lists of e-mail addresses of california residents .
computer tapping prosecutors said pw marketing violated the 1998 anti-spam law because these unsolicited e-mails were sent without a free call number for recipients to phone to stop additional mailings .
they also failed to follow state requirements to include a valid return address .
the state attorney , bill lockyer , also said the owners illegally tapped into computer users ' network connections so the company could send e-mails that could not be traced back to its source .
the judgement , which mr lockyer said will be the model for future spam injunctions , forbids pw marketing from sending unsolicited commercial e-mails , accessing computers that belong to other people without their permission and disguising its identity by sending messages that appear to originate from a different address .
the injunction also forbids willis and griffin from owning or managing any business that advertises over the internet for 10 years .
after 1 january , the state 's anti-spam laws will get tougher and will also allow private individuals to sue spammers and collect damages of up to $ 1,000 per e-mail .

research carried out in beijing suggests that the repetitive movement of pinching the chopsticks together to pick up food can cause joint problems in the fingers and hand .
more than 2,500 beijing residents aged 60 , who ate using chopsticks , were assessed for signs of bone damage in their hands by the boston university school of medicine .
researchers gave their findings to a meeting of the american college of rheumatology in orlando , florida , after studying x-rays of their hands .
they concluded that further study was needed - but noted that the effect was unlikely to deter people from continuing a practice which goes back thousands of years .
in normal joints cartilage covers the end of each bone .
it acts as a cushion between the bones and allows joints to move smoothly .
but in osteoarthritis , the cartilage between the joints breaks down causing pain and swelling which can stop sufferers from doing day to day activities like getting dressed .
what causes the disease is not known , although doctors suspect that repeated overuse of particular joints may be to blame .
