german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .

limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .

the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "

it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .

in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .

the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .

limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .

headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .

german defense minister peter struck said the european proposals would complement nato . “ i think the agreement with britain and france should strengthen the european part of nato , ” struck said according to reuters news agency .
“ this can and must be in the interest of our american friends . ” last week , britain , france and germany , europe ’ s leading nations on defense matters , agreed on a plan to create an autonomous eu military planning unit in brussels for the bloc which is expanding to 25 members next may .

from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . nato builds up and reduces forces besides mulling the implications of the eu ’ s plans , nato officials also launched a new anti-terror battalion to protect against chemical , biological and nuclear attacks .
the unit will be able to undertake missions of up to six months and troops could be ready for deployment within five days .

eventually the eu is expected to take over the mission from nato completely . despite an appeal from outgoing nato secretary-general george robertson for greater involvement in afghanistan , the 19 member nations of the alliance remained hesitant to commit more to its peacekeeping operations there . “ the nato governments must have the political will to station their forces in greater numbers and to use them than currently , ” robertson told a press conference .

eu defense ministers meeting in brussels are trying to sell plans for a beefed up european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
but criticism from washington remains subdued . at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers , officials from the european union defended their plans to create an independent military planning unit at the transatlantic alliance ’ s headquarters shape in mons , belgium .
german defense minister peter struck said the european proposals would complement nato . “ i think the agreement with britain and france should strengthen the european part of nato , ” struck said according to reuters news agency .
“ this can and must be in the interest of our american friends . ” last week , britain , france and germany , europe ’ s leading nations on defense matters , agreed on a plan to create an autonomous eu military planning unit in brussels for the bloc which is expanding to 25 members next may .
washington has been highly critical of such moves in the past , fearing a waste of resources and a potential challenge to nato . but u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld held back his criticism while in brussels , saying that washington was being consulted by eu leaders about the plans .
“ i ’ m confident and hopeful that things will sort through in a way that we end up with an arrangement that is not duplicative or competitive , ” he said . america irked in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters the united states was furious over plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg this spring to launch a completely separate eu military planning unit , which it believed would compromise the role of nato . but britain convinced its european partners to scale back the plans to have a planning cell at nato ’ s shape headquarters .
from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . nato builds up and reduces forces besides mulling the implications of the eu ’ s plans , nato officials also launched a new anti-terror battalion to protect against chemical , biological and nuclear attacks .
the unit will be able to undertake missions of up to six months and troops could be ready for deployment within five days .
around 500 soldiers from 13 countries will be available for the new battalion . they also agreed to reduce the number of troops involved in peacekeeping duties in bosnia from 12,000 to 7,000 by this march .
eventually the eu is expected to take over the mission from nato completely . despite an appeal from outgoing nato secretary-general george robertson for greater involvement in afghanistan , the 19 member nations of the alliance remained hesitant to commit more to its peacekeeping operations there . “ the nato governments must have the political will to station their forces in greater numbers and to use them than currently , ” robertson told a press conference .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .

weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .

more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .

siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .
members of the green ’ s parliamentary group already said lifting the embargo was not up for discussion .
winfried nachtwei , the green ’ s deputy whip , said china ’ s human rights violations justified a continuation of the embargo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , met with national peoples congress chairman wu bangguo in beijing on tuesday .
others agreed : “ the chancellor ’ s causing the coalition grief by making such casual remarks , “ winfried herrmann , a green parliamentarian , said .
angelika beer , the green party leader and defense expert , also said that it was “ very early ” to talk about an end to the arms embargo .
any chinese arms requests would have to be denied , beer said , citing germany ’ s arms export guidelines , which prevent sales to countries that violate human rights . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in china to promote business german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china on a three-day visit .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .

eu defense ministers meeting in brussels are trying to sell plans for a beefed up european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
but criticism from washington remains subdued . at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers , officials from the european union defended their plans to create an independent military planning unit at the transatlantic alliance ’ s headquarters shape in mons , belgium .
german defense minister peter struck said the european proposals would complement nato . “ i think the agreement with britain and france should strengthen the european part of nato , ” struck said according to reuters news agency .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .
and chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations , emphasized the necessity for economic and political stability in the region to foster valuable partnerships for fighting terrorism .
the foreign ministers are expected to agree on a reinforced lending facility by the european investment bank to encourage private investment - and stimulate jobs - in the region .

one of the most enduring and inflammatory trade disputes between the u.s. and european union will come to an end if president george w. bush removes tariffs on imported steel this week . both the wall street journal and washington p ost have reported that u.s. president bush is due to announce the decision following a campaign fundraising trip through the heart of steel country in pennsylvania this week . the elimination of the duties of up to 30 percent on steel imports from europe , south america and asia could cost him votes in november ’ s presidential election , but will avert a massive billion-dollar trade war with the european union , according to analysts . after a world trade organization appeals court ruled in favor of the eu ’ s case against the protectionist tariffs on nov .

more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .

" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .

though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .

mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "

taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

one of the most enduring and inflammatory trade disputes between the u.s. and european union will come to an end if president george w. bush removes tariffs on imported steel this week . both the wall street journal and washington p ost have reported that u.s. president bush is due to announce the decision following a campaign fundraising trip through the heart of steel country in pennsylvania this week . the elimination of the duties of up to 30 percent on steel imports from europe , south america and asia could cost him votes in november ’ s presidential election , but will avert a massive billion-dollar trade war with the european union , according to analysts . after a world trade organization appeals court ruled in favor of the eu ’ s case against the protectionist tariffs on nov .

" to remove these -lrb- tariffs -rrb- and to buckle under to the europeans would be a mistake , " said thomas j. usher , chief executive officer and president of u.s. steel , the nation 's largest steelmaker said in the wall street journal this week .
steel industry representatives had hoped for a compromise in which the tariffs would be repealed six months before they ran out in march 2005 .
the industry , described by some analysts as a dinosaur in desperate need of modernization , has been slowly consolidating under the protection of the duties .
but critics say that by protecting the business of steelmakers in electorally-important states like west virginia , pennsylvania and ohio , the bush administration was hurting local steel producers who had to pay higher prices for their imported steel . european leaders and eu officials have not commented on the possibility bush will lift tariffs .

eu defense ministers meeting in brussels are trying to sell plans for a beefed up european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
but criticism from washington remains subdued . at a two-day meeting of nato defense ministers , officials from the european union defended their plans to create an independent military planning unit at the transatlantic alliance ’ s headquarters shape in mons , belgium .
german defense minister peter struck said the european proposals would complement nato . “ i think the agreement with britain and france should strengthen the european part of nato , ” struck said according to reuters news agency .
“ this can and must be in the interest of our american friends . ” last week , britain , france and germany , europe ’ s leading nations on defense matters , agreed on a plan to create an autonomous eu military planning unit in brussels for the bloc which is expanding to 25 members next may .
washington has been highly critical of such moves in the past , fearing a waste of resources and a potential challenge to nato . but u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld held back his criticism while in brussels , saying that washington was being consulted by eu leaders about the plans .
“ i ’ m confident and hopeful that things will sort through in a way that we end up with an arrangement that is not duplicative or competitive , ” he said . america irked in the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters the united states was furious over plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg this spring to launch a completely separate eu military planning unit , which it believed would compromise the role of nato . but britain convinced its european partners to scale back the plans to have a planning cell at nato ’ s shape headquarters .
from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . nato builds up and reduces forces besides mulling the implications of the eu ’ s plans , nato officials also launched a new anti-terror battalion to protect against chemical , biological and nuclear attacks .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .
and chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations , emphasized the necessity for economic and political stability in the region to foster valuable partnerships for fighting terrorism .
the foreign ministers are expected to agree on a reinforced lending facility by the european investment bank to encourage private investment - and stimulate jobs - in the region .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .

siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .
members of the green ’ s parliamentary group already said lifting the embargo was not up for discussion .

angelika beer , the green party leader and defense expert , also said that it was “ very early ” to talk about an end to the arms embargo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2003 headscarf issue rears its head again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headscarves are causing a stir in europe .
“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do .

headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do .

more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .
siemens completed the € 700 million -lrb- $ 837 million -rrb- plant in 1991 , but it never began producing fuel elements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the plutonium plant in hanau near frankfurt .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .
members of the green ’ s parliamentary group already said lifting the embargo was not up for discussion .
winfried nachtwei , the green ’ s deputy whip , said china ’ s human rights violations justified a continuation of the embargo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , met with national peoples congress chairman wu bangguo in beijing on tuesday .
others agreed : “ the chancellor ’ s causing the coalition grief by making such casual remarks , “ winfried herrmann , a green parliamentarian , said .
angelika beer , the green party leader and defense expert , also said that it was “ very early ” to talk about an end to the arms embargo .
any chinese arms requests would have to be denied , beer said , citing germany ’ s arms export guidelines , which prevent sales to countries that violate human rights . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in china to promote business german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china on a three-day visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2003 with a shrinking population , a german island 's future imperiled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's red sandstone cliffs are an important symbol of postwar germany .
more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .
and chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations , emphasized the necessity for economic and political stability in the region to foster valuable partnerships for fighting terrorism .
the foreign ministers are expected to agree on a reinforced lending facility by the european investment bank to encourage private investment - and stimulate jobs - in the region .
" forty million jobs have to be created over the next decade if employment rates are to be maintained at only their current levels , " explained patten .
clouds on the horizon christian leffler , the eu official responsible for relations with the mediterranean goes a step further when explaining the significance of the euro-med partnership .
" the stability and development of the -lrb- mediterranean -rrb- region is one of the main goals of the eu , also regarding the numerous clouds that are thickening on the horizon because of the conflicts in the middle east and in the mediterranean area . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's deputy premier gianfranco fini and there are certainly clouds on the horizon .
the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process , as well as the war in iraq , set an ominous backdrop to the talks .
italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini 's recent remark that israel 's building of a security wall was an act of self-defense incensed amr mussa , head of the arab league .
to show his displeasure at what he sees as italy 's bias toward israel , he chose to stay home from the naples meeting and send his deputy instead .
" this is an act of protest against italy but not against the european union , " a spokesman for eu external relations commissioner patten told reuters when asked about mussa 's absence .
touching on geo-strategic issues in spite of the current turmoil , others see the eu-med conference as a unique opportunity for these states to touch on vital geo-strategic issues .
" i think we should take advantage -lrb- of this meeting -rrb- because it 's the only forum at which israel , the arab states , turkey , and the europeans all get together , " emphasized german foreign minister joschka fischer at last year 's meeting on crete .
besides immigration and security , talks are to cover the establishment of a euro-mediterranean parliamentary assembly and final preparations for a foundation to foster dialogue between european and mediterranean cultures . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes fade as constitution talks hit more obstacles just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .

siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .

“ this can and must be in the interest of our american friends . ” last week , britain , france and germany , europe ’ s leading nations on defense matters , agreed on a plan to create an autonomous eu military planning unit in brussels for the bloc which is expanding to 25 members next may .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .
siemens completed the € 700 million -lrb- $ 837 million -rrb- plant in 1991 , but it never began producing fuel elements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the plutonium plant in hanau near frankfurt .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .
members of the green ’ s parliamentary group already said lifting the embargo was not up for discussion .
winfried nachtwei , the green ’ s deputy whip , said china ’ s human rights violations justified a continuation of the embargo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , met with national peoples congress chairman wu bangguo in beijing on tuesday .
others agreed : “ the chancellor ’ s causing the coalition grief by making such casual remarks , “ winfried herrmann , a green parliamentarian , said .
angelika beer , the green party leader and defense expert , also said that it was “ very early ” to talk about an end to the arms embargo .
any chinese arms requests would have to be denied , beer said , citing germany ’ s arms export guidelines , which prevent sales to countries that violate human rights . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in china to promote business german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china on a three-day visit .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .

the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .
and chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations , emphasized the necessity for economic and political stability in the region to foster valuable partnerships for fighting terrorism .
the foreign ministers are expected to agree on a reinforced lending facility by the european investment bank to encourage private investment - and stimulate jobs - in the region .
" forty million jobs have to be created over the next decade if employment rates are to be maintained at only their current levels , " explained patten .

more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .

limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .

the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .

less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .
and chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations , emphasized the necessity for economic and political stability in the region to foster valuable partnerships for fighting terrorism .
the foreign ministers are expected to agree on a reinforced lending facility by the european investment bank to encourage private investment - and stimulate jobs - in the region .
" forty million jobs have to be created over the next decade if employment rates are to be maintained at only their current levels , " explained patten .
clouds on the horizon christian leffler , the eu official responsible for relations with the mediterranean goes a step further when explaining the significance of the euro-med partnership .
" the stability and development of the -lrb- mediterranean -rrb- region is one of the main goals of the eu , also regarding the numerous clouds that are thickening on the horizon because of the conflicts in the middle east and in the mediterranean area . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's deputy premier gianfranco fini and there are certainly clouds on the horizon .
the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process , as well as the war in iraq , set an ominous backdrop to the talks .
italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini 's recent remark that israel 's building of a security wall was an act of self-defense incensed amr mussa , head of the arab league .
to show his displeasure at what he sees as italy 's bias toward israel , he chose to stay home from the naples meeting and send his deputy instead .
" this is an act of protest against italy but not against the european union , " a spokesman for eu external relations commissioner patten told reuters when asked about mussa 's absence .
touching on geo-strategic issues in spite of the current turmoil , others see the eu-med conference as a unique opportunity for these states to touch on vital geo-strategic issues .
" i think we should take advantage -lrb- of this meeting -rrb- because it 's the only forum at which israel , the arab states , turkey , and the europeans all get together , " emphasized german foreign minister joschka fischer at last year 's meeting on crete .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .
and chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations , emphasized the necessity for economic and political stability in the region to foster valuable partnerships for fighting terrorism .
the foreign ministers are expected to agree on a reinforced lending facility by the european investment bank to encourage private investment - and stimulate jobs - in the region .
" forty million jobs have to be created over the next decade if employment rates are to be maintained at only their current levels , " explained patten .
clouds on the horizon christian leffler , the eu official responsible for relations with the mediterranean goes a step further when explaining the significance of the euro-med partnership .
" the stability and development of the -lrb- mediterranean -rrb- region is one of the main goals of the eu , also regarding the numerous clouds that are thickening on the horizon because of the conflicts in the middle east and in the mediterranean area . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's deputy premier gianfranco fini and there are certainly clouds on the horizon .
the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process , as well as the war in iraq , set an ominous backdrop to the talks .
italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini 's recent remark that israel 's building of a security wall was an act of self-defense incensed amr mussa , head of the arab league .
to show his displeasure at what he sees as italy 's bias toward israel , he chose to stay home from the naples meeting and send his deputy instead .
" this is an act of protest against italy but not against the european union , " a spokesman for eu external relations commissioner patten told reuters when asked about mussa 's absence .
touching on geo-strategic issues in spite of the current turmoil , others see the eu-med conference as a unique opportunity for these states to touch on vital geo-strategic issues .
" i think we should take advantage -lrb- of this meeting -rrb- because it 's the only forum at which israel , the arab states , turkey , and the europeans all get together , " emphasized german foreign minister joschka fischer at last year 's meeting on crete .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .
siemens completed the € 700 million -lrb- $ 837 million -rrb- plant in 1991 , but it never began producing fuel elements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the plutonium plant in hanau near frankfurt .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .
members of the green ’ s parliamentary group already said lifting the embargo was not up for discussion .
winfried nachtwei , the green ’ s deputy whip , said china ’ s human rights violations justified a continuation of the embargo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , met with national peoples congress chairman wu bangguo in beijing on tuesday .
others agreed : “ the chancellor ’ s causing the coalition grief by making such casual remarks , “ winfried herrmann , a green parliamentarian , said .
angelika beer , the green party leader and defense expert , also said that it was “ very early ” to talk about an end to the arms embargo .
any chinese arms requests would have to be denied , beer said , citing germany ’ s arms export guidelines , which prevent sales to countries that violate human rights . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in china to promote business german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china on a three-day visit .

more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

one of the most enduring and inflammatory trade disputes between the u.s. and european union will come to an end if president george w. bush removes tariffs on imported steel this week . both the wall street journal and washington p ost have reported that u.s. president bush is due to announce the decision following a campaign fundraising trip through the heart of steel country in pennsylvania this week . the elimination of the duties of up to 30 percent on steel imports from europe , south america and asia could cost him votes in november ’ s presidential election , but will avert a massive billion-dollar trade war with the european union , according to analysts . after a world trade organization appeals court ruled in favor of the eu ’ s case against the protectionist tariffs on nov .
10 , brussels began upping the pressure on bush to get rid of the illegal duties . the union threatened to impose duties of up to $ 2.2 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- on products like orange juice and farming equipment from states that will be important to bush in next year 's presidential election . steelers protest wanting to avert the escalation of one of several trade disputes between the two partners , the administration appears ready to throw down the gauntlet despite the warnings and protest of major american steelmakers .
" to remove these -lrb- tariffs -rrb- and to buckle under to the europeans would be a mistake , " said thomas j. usher , chief executive officer and president of u.s. steel , the nation 's largest steelmaker said in the wall street journal this week .
steel industry representatives had hoped for a compromise in which the tariffs would be repealed six months before they ran out in march 2005 .
the industry , described by some analysts as a dinosaur in desperate need of modernization , has been slowly consolidating under the protection of the duties .
but critics say that by protecting the business of steelmakers in electorally-important states like west virginia , pennsylvania and ohio , the bush administration was hurting local steel producers who had to pay higher prices for their imported steel . european leaders and eu officials have not commented on the possibility bush will lift tariffs .
but the move will be greeted , especially in germany .
just two weeks ago , chancellor gerhard schröder was in new york lobbying for a lifting of the sanctions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to u.s. as trade war looms german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .

one of the most enduring and inflammatory trade disputes between the u.s. and european union will come to an end if president george w. bush removes tariffs on imported steel this week . both the wall street journal and washington p ost have reported that u.s. president bush is due to announce the decision following a campaign fundraising trip through the heart of steel country in pennsylvania this week . the elimination of the duties of up to 30 percent on steel imports from europe , south america and asia could cost him votes in november ’ s presidential election , but will avert a massive billion-dollar trade war with the european union , according to analysts . after a world trade organization appeals court ruled in favor of the eu ’ s case against the protectionist tariffs on nov .

" to remove these -lrb- tariffs -rrb- and to buckle under to the europeans would be a mistake , " said thomas j. usher , chief executive officer and president of u.s. steel , the nation 's largest steelmaker said in the wall street journal this week .

the industry , described by some analysts as a dinosaur in desperate need of modernization , has been slowly consolidating under the protection of the duties .
but critics say that by protecting the business of steelmakers in electorally-important states like west virginia , pennsylvania and ohio , the bush administration was hurting local steel producers who had to pay higher prices for their imported steel . european leaders and eu officials have not commented on the possibility bush will lift tariffs .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .
siemens completed the € 700 million -lrb- $ 837 million -rrb- plant in 1991 , but it never began producing fuel elements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the plutonium plant in hanau near frankfurt .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .
members of the green ’ s parliamentary group already said lifting the embargo was not up for discussion .
winfried nachtwei , the green ’ s deputy whip , said china ’ s human rights violations justified a continuation of the embargo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , met with national peoples congress chairman wu bangguo in beijing on tuesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .
“ i don ’ t see that the iraq war caused any noteworthy burdens to these ties , ” he said .
“ one should be able to have a different viewpoint among political friends .
what is important is that we now look to the future . ”
indeed , schröder seems to be doing just that , and he is looking to boost trade relations and direct investment in the hopes that the increased revenue will breath new life into the german economy .
“ i ’ m eager to explain my german economic reform program ‘ agenda 2010 ’ and to promote germany as a place to do business .
we are an attractive place for investors , and the numbers back that up - especially for american business , ” he said .
his proposed tax cut alone , claims the chancellor , could free up € 22 billion for consumers and corporations , and he expects the economy will grow by 1.5 to 2.0 percent next year .
trouble ahead : a strong euro and a trade war ?
but all is not well .
chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .
but the soaring euro and a looming trade war threaten to overshadow his visit . schröder 's quick visit to america is all about business , unlike his last trip to the united states in september , when he met with u.s. president george bush to soothe tense relations following their disagreement over iraq .
opting out of any political appointments , schröder is scheduled to meet with top business leaders to talk up american-german trade relations .
but the soaring euro against the u.s. dollar and a disagreement over u.s. steel tariffs will loom large during the visit .
germany ’ s ailing economy - heavily dependent on exports - grew a meager 0.2 percent in the third quarter , making it important for the chancellor to bolster trade relations with germany ’ s second largest trading partner , the united states .
what ’ s more , u.s. investors have poured billions into germany , making them the top foreign investors .
more u.s. investment could translate into more jobs for germany , which suffers chronically high unemployment .
iraq troubles in the past in an interview given to the news agency reuters prior to his departure , schröder stated that he did not believe the trade relationship had suffered negative consequences due to tensions over iraq .

chancellor schröder travels to new york at time when trade relations between the united states and europe are particularly tense .
the eu has strongly opposed the steel tariffs president bush implemented in march of 2002 to protect his country ’ s troubled domestic industry .
last month , the world trade organisation ruled that these tariffs are illegal and ordered bush ’ s administration to repeal them , which he has yet to do .
in the reuters interview , schröder had strong words for washington regarding steel tariffs , and he urged the current administration to comply with the wto ruling or face the consequences - in short , a trade war .
“ germany assumes that the united states will implement the wto decision , ” he said .
“ that includes the dismantling of steel import tariffs as well as the unjustified subsidies for american exporters . ”
if not , said schröder , the eu would proceed with proposed sanctions as early as december , but he hoped “ that it wouldn ’ t come to that . ”
besides a potential trade war for schröder worry about , the soaring euro - it reached a record high this week near $ 1.20 - threatens to put the breaks on germany 's export-led recovery .
if the euro continues to remain at current levels or , even worse , further increase in value , the high cost of german products abroad could make them unattractive . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .

one of the most enduring and inflammatory trade disputes between the u.s. and european union will come to an end if president george w. bush removes tariffs on imported steel this week . both the wall street journal and washington p ost have reported that u.s. president bush is due to announce the decision following a campaign fundraising trip through the heart of steel country in pennsylvania this week . the elimination of the duties of up to 30 percent on steel imports from europe , south america and asia could cost him votes in november ’ s presidential election , but will avert a massive billion-dollar trade war with the european union , according to analysts . after a world trade organization appeals court ruled in favor of the eu ’ s case against the protectionist tariffs on nov .
10 , brussels began upping the pressure on bush to get rid of the illegal duties . the union threatened to impose duties of up to $ 2.2 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- on products like orange juice and farming equipment from states that will be important to bush in next year 's presidential election . steelers protest wanting to avert the escalation of one of several trade disputes between the two partners , the administration appears ready to throw down the gauntlet despite the warnings and protest of major american steelmakers .
" to remove these -lrb- tariffs -rrb- and to buckle under to the europeans would be a mistake , " said thomas j. usher , chief executive officer and president of u.s. steel , the nation 's largest steelmaker said in the wall street journal this week .
steel industry representatives had hoped for a compromise in which the tariffs would be repealed six months before they ran out in march 2005 .
the industry , described by some analysts as a dinosaur in desperate need of modernization , has been slowly consolidating under the protection of the duties .
but critics say that by protecting the business of steelmakers in electorally-important states like west virginia , pennsylvania and ohio , the bush administration was hurting local steel producers who had to pay higher prices for their imported steel . european leaders and eu officials have not commented on the possibility bush will lift tariffs .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .
siemens completed the € 700 million -lrb- $ 837 million -rrb- plant in 1991 , but it never began producing fuel elements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the plutonium plant in hanau near frankfurt .

more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

talks between eu foreign ministers and their mediterranean counterparts focus on immigration and security issues . italy , which is hosting the meeting of eu foreign ministers and their colleagues from mediterranean states bordering the bloc , recently felt the brunt of difficulties posed by illegal immigration from its mediterranean neighbors and beyond .
in october two boats of refugees washed up on its southern shores , at least 13 of whom were dead .
at the top of the agenda of the two-day meeting in naples is immigration and security .
last week the italian government said it was concerned that influxes of illegal economic immigrants could be infiltrated by islamic extremists planning attacks in europe .
and chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations , emphasized the necessity for economic and political stability in the region to foster valuable partnerships for fighting terrorism .
the foreign ministers are expected to agree on a reinforced lending facility by the european investment bank to encourage private investment - and stimulate jobs - in the region .
" forty million jobs have to be created over the next decade if employment rates are to be maintained at only their current levels , " explained patten .
clouds on the horizon christian leffler , the eu official responsible for relations with the mediterranean goes a step further when explaining the significance of the euro-med partnership .
" the stability and development of the -lrb- mediterranean -rrb- region is one of the main goals of the eu , also regarding the numerous clouds that are thickening on the horizon because of the conflicts in the middle east and in the mediterranean area . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's deputy premier gianfranco fini and there are certainly clouds on the horizon .
the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process , as well as the war in iraq , set an ominous backdrop to the talks .
italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini 's recent remark that israel 's building of a security wall was an act of self-defense incensed amr mussa , head of the arab league .
to show his displeasure at what he sees as italy 's bias toward israel , he chose to stay home from the naples meeting and send his deputy instead .
" this is an act of protest against italy but not against the european union , " a spokesman for eu external relations commissioner patten told reuters when asked about mussa 's absence .
touching on geo-strategic issues in spite of the current turmoil , others see the eu-med conference as a unique opportunity for these states to touch on vital geo-strategic issues .
" i think we should take advantage -lrb- of this meeting -rrb- because it 's the only forum at which israel , the arab states , turkey , and the europeans all get together , " emphasized german foreign minister joschka fischer at last year 's meeting on crete .
besides immigration and security , talks are to cover the establishment of a euro-mediterranean parliamentary assembly and final preparations for a foundation to foster dialogue between european and mediterranean cultures . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hopes fade as constitution talks hit more obstacles just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again .

one of the most enduring and inflammatory trade disputes between the u.s. and european union will come to an end if president george w. bush removes tariffs on imported steel this week . both the wall street journal and washington p ost have reported that u.s. president bush is due to announce the decision following a campaign fundraising trip through the heart of steel country in pennsylvania this week . the elimination of the duties of up to 30 percent on steel imports from europe , south america and asia could cost him votes in november ’ s presidential election , but will avert a massive billion-dollar trade war with the european union , according to analysts . after a world trade organization appeals court ruled in favor of the eu ’ s case against the protectionist tariffs on nov .
10 , brussels began upping the pressure on bush to get rid of the illegal duties . the union threatened to impose duties of up to $ 2.2 billion -lrb- € 1.9 billion -rrb- on products like orange juice and farming equipment from states that will be important to bush in next year 's presidential election . steelers protest wanting to avert the escalation of one of several trade disputes between the two partners , the administration appears ready to throw down the gauntlet despite the warnings and protest of major american steelmakers .
" to remove these -lrb- tariffs -rrb- and to buckle under to the europeans would be a mistake , " said thomas j. usher , chief executive officer and president of u.s. steel , the nation 's largest steelmaker said in the wall street journal this week .
steel industry representatives had hoped for a compromise in which the tariffs would be repealed six months before they ran out in march 2005 .
the industry , described by some analysts as a dinosaur in desperate need of modernization , has been slowly consolidating under the protection of the duties .
but critics say that by protecting the business of steelmakers in electorally-important states like west virginia , pennsylvania and ohio , the bush administration was hurting local steel producers who had to pay higher prices for their imported steel . european leaders and eu officials have not commented on the possibility bush will lift tariffs .
but the move will be greeted , especially in germany .

more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .
the embargo is the last one that was imposed after the bloody suppression of student revolts at tiananmen square in 1989 . “ the new china is no longer the tiananmen-china , ” dpa quoted a delegation member travelling with schröder on a three-day trip to china .
while the people ’ s republic apparently has not asked for arms deliveries , chinese leaders consider the embargo “ discrimination , ” german government representatives told the news service . they added that china had proven itself as a responsible partner in the united nations as well as by acting as a mediator in the north korea nuclear crisis .
france has already suggested lifting the embargo . china eyeing german plutonium plant while china might not be directly looking for arms , chinese premier wen jiabao told schröder that he would like to buy a plutonium plant near frankfurt and bring it to china .
siemens completed the € 700 million -lrb- $ 837 million -rrb- plant in 1991 , but it never began producing fuel elements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the plutonium plant in hanau near frankfurt .
siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is travelling with schröder in china , confirmed initial talks about a sale , estimated at € 50 million .
weapons-grade plutonium could be produced in the plant , but china already has had the nuclear bomb for about 40 years . asked about the sale , schröder said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen .
“ it doesn ’ t look like there is anything that will prevent it , ” the chancellor said on tuesday during a visit to canton province in southern china . u.s. likely to oppose end to embargo , plant sale schröder ’ s comments on the plant sale are likely to anger u.s. officials , whose foreign and security policy centers around the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . they are also bound to eye with suspicion the chancellor ’ s support for ending the arms embargo .
china is the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms , followed by taiwan , which is mainly supported by the u.s. government .
china views taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened the island republic with an invasion . schröder still has to sell plans to coalition partner after his return to germany , the social democratic chancellor will still have to convince his government ’ s junior coalition partner the greens that an end to the arms embargo is justified .
members of the green ’ s parliamentary group already said lifting the embargo was not up for discussion .
winfried nachtwei , the green ’ s deputy whip , said china ’ s human rights violations justified a continuation of the embargo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , met with national peoples congress chairman wu bangguo in beijing on tuesday .
others agreed : “ the chancellor ’ s causing the coalition grief by making such casual remarks , “ winfried herrmann , a green parliamentarian , said .
angelika beer , the green party leader and defense expert , also said that it was “ very early ” to talk about an end to the arms embargo .
any chinese arms requests would have to be denied , beer said , citing germany ’ s arms export guidelines , which prevent sales to countries that violate human rights . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in china to promote business german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china on a three-day visit .

it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .

" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "

the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.12.2003 with a shrinking population , a german island 's future imperiled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's red sandstone cliffs are an important symbol of postwar germany .
more than 500,000 people visit helgoland each year , but the island ’ s youth population are fleeing to the mainland in droves to find better opportunities for education and work on the mainland . it once played host to goethe , the father of modern german literature .
it 's where hoffmann penned the german national anthem .
it 's the place where heisenberg went to do the quantum physics thinking that landed him the nobel prize .
but today , helgoland , a small north sea island off the coast of germany , is in the greatest danger of extinction since the british used the island for bombing tests after world war ii .
half the inhabitants on the island , a favorite destination for german day trippers enjoying its dramatic red sandstone cliffs and duty free status , are over the age of 50 .
less than a quarter are under the age of 30 .
what ’ s more , the island loses 30 people a year , with the population shrinking from 1,950 residents to 1,650 over the past decade .
" the biggest cause is the exodus of youth , " mayor frank botter told dw-world .
" they leave for school because you can ’ t complete a college prep degree here - they have to go the mainland and they usually don ’ t come back . "
limited schools , opportunities the nearest college prep school is at least two-hours away from the island by ferry . in a problem typical of other north sea islands , parents must foot the bill if they want to send their children to schools on the mainland .
the average cost of putting students up in a boarding school is at least € 7,200 -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- a year , said botter , whose own daughter spent four years at a mainland college prep school .
he 's banded together with other islands to get state and federal governments to reimburse parents for the cost of sending their kids away for basic schooling .
taking action in response to the youth drain , helgoland politicians have launched an offensive to convince their young people to stay put and to attract newcomers to the island .
in order to tackle helgoland 's tight and expensive real estate market , the island is partially funding a € 2.3 million project that will bring inexpensive housing to young workers and families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's gorgeous red cliffs .
in contrast to the mainland , demand often exceeds supply for low-end jobs .
indeed , the island - measuring just one square kilometer - has only 52 unemployed . the half-million tourists that flock to the island from harbor cities like bremen and hamburg everyday bring in most of the € 85 million in annual revenues .
though the bustling tourism industry brings many jobs , they tend to be in the service sector and unattractive to those who leave helgoland for a higher education .
" they don ’ t come back because there aren ’ t adequate jobs for people who have completed a college education , " says manfred augener , an editor for the pinneberger zeitung , a newspaper distributed on helgoland .
" if you study biology you can get a job here , but otherwise the opportunities are limited . "
seeking more employers - and a dentist the island ’ s renowned international marine research laboratory , with 170 workers , is a major employer .
the island is also negotiating to land the fleets of the planned european union coast guard as well vessels from the german federal border guard and environmental protection agencies on helgoland , which would bring new jobs and , officials hope , more families .
mayor botter says he is also seeking to attract companies that service the offshore windparks in the north sea region , which would open up other possibilities for highly trained workers .
" we want to create a future for our kids , " he says .
" we have to give them opportunities - not just education , but also jobs and affordable housing later on . "
despite the overall dearth of professional jobs , they do come up occasionally .
problem is , it can be hard to find workers , given helgoland 's geographical isolation . helgoland 's only dentist recently retired , meaning patients with an aching tooth must now take one of only four ferries a week that ply the waters in winter to the mainland .
and when the island 's minister left his post last year , it took six months to find a replacement .
a german symbol at stake is the future of an island that has been a symbol of german tradition and culture for more than a hundred years .
though people have lived on the island for 2,000 years , it ’ s only been firmly in german hands since 1890 , after shuffling between the danes and the brits .
" helgoland is tied to the grand traditions of poets and thinkers who used to travel to the island at the turn of the century , " says augener .
later , hitler expanded the island to become a major war port ; the subsequent allied bombings took a devastating toll .
" there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students raise the german flag over helgoland in 1950. was the bombardment , the occupation and then , at the worst point , the british tried to destroy the island completely with their ‘ big bang ’ tests , " said augener .
the island has been resettled since 1952 .
in the end , botter hopes helgoland ’ s initiatives will increase the local population to 1,700 , a figure he says would be a success .
meanwhile , journalist augener says he believes helgoland officials are starting to take the crisis seriously .
" people have recognized that tourism can ’ t be the only possibility for the island , " he said .
" you have to offer people more , they have to do more to keep their people . "
that will be the key to helgoland 's long-term survival .
" if the youth don ’ t come , " warns mayor botter .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
at the same time , the court insisted that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
" what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s inside it " monday ’ s protest is now focussing on four german states , which are scrambling to impose a ban on headscarf-wearing teachers in the aftermath of the september ruling .
marieluise beck told deutsche welle about how the protest took shape .
" it came about because we noticed that after the karlsruhe ruling , emotions were much stronger than objectivity and rationality and that a discerning element to the debate was increasingly missing . "
beck added that the legislation hammered out by the four states attempting to enact the headscarf ban had " violated the clearly formulated constitutional command of the ruling , namely that it should be about the equal treatment of all religions . "
beck said , " what we ’ re trying to say is that what ’ s decisive is not what ’ s on the head , but rather what ’ s inside it . "
headscarf ban an obstacle to emancipation the protest appeal is also an attempt to make society understand women rights , the group says .
the signatories say a headscarf ban limits a women ’ s freedom of choice as well as leads to a stigmatization .
" a threatening situation has now arisen for women wearing a headscarf – not just for teachers , there aren ’ t so many , but for all women who wear a headscarf .
it ’ s unsettling , " said berlin ’ s former commissioner for foreigners , barbara john .
the protestors say a headscarf ban won ’ t just hinder muslim women ’ s emancipation by making it difficult for them to take up a profession , but also reinforce old prejudices and work against the very values of tolerance and openness enshrined in the constitution .
actress and author renan demirkan , of turkish origin , said she was convinced that the headscarf would be instrumentalized – not just by the mullahs , but also by the very politicians who want to forbid it .
but the appeal against a headscarf ban has come in for scathing criticism from the strongly secular turkish alliance berlin .
" in a time of increased fundamentalist activity , such naivete is hard to understand , " the organization said in a statement on tuesday .
the organization has demanded that " all political and religious symbols " should be forbidden by law in all walks of public service and reminded that the present headscarf ban only relates to working in public service and doesn ’ t amount to a general ban . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german states move to enact headscarf bans germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .

“ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers . over 70 women gathered in front of the symbolically significant statue of the roman goddess minerva - the patron of teachers and the goddess of wisdom - at the german parliament building in berlin on monday to plead for a more discerning and objective debate over the muslim headscarf .
the group , which sees itself working independently of political and religious considerations , signed an " appeal against a headscarf law . "
initiated by federal commissioner for integration and foreigners , marieluise beck , the protest initiative includes politicians from across the party spectrum , scientists and leaders from the church and media .
former parliamentary president , rita süssmuth , minister for consumer affairs and agriculture renate künast , federal commissioner for human rights claudia roth and popular actresses katja riemann and renan demirkan have all lent the petition their support .
headscarf doesn ’ t equal fundamentalism the group resists equating muslim women wearing headscarves with fundamentalism .
though they admit that the headscarf , veil and all-enveloping burkha are visible instruments used by islamic fundamentalists to portray the repression of women , it insists that not all women wearing the headscarf are religious fanatics .
the protestors emphasize that many muslim women don ’ t view emancipation and the headscarf as contradictory .
" we shouldn ’ t exclude these women with a headscarf ban , " the group warns .
headscarf debate a recurring issue the headscarf issue has rocked germany and several parts of europe with large muslim populations in recent years with increasing frequency .
the question of whether headscarf-wearing muslim women should be allowed to take up posts in state-run schools and in public life and how far such a tradition compromises a western country ’ s constitutionally-enshrined religious neutrality has sparked furious debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fereshta ludin in september this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman -lrb- photo -rrb- from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .

an exceptionally dry summer and autumn has almost halved water levels compared to last year at the reservoirs , which serve manchester and other parts of the north west .
the united utilities water company has responded by applying to the environment agency for " drought measures " to safeguard the region 's supplies .
it wants to pump water from ullswater and windermere , two of the most popular lakes in cumbria 's lake district .
lake district around 12m people visit the area every year the deepest lake is wastwater at 74 metres -lrb- 243 feet -rrb- windermere is 62 metres -lrb- 203 feet -rrb- deep and ullswater 61 metres -lrb- 200 feet -rrb- deep the lakes provide homes for birds such as coots and mallards the biggest reservoir in the lake district is haweswater , which holds 18,600m gallons the inquiry on tuesday will hear from objectors who argue that any change in the water flow in the lakes will threaten fish and other fragile eco-systems .
the company said the measures , if granted , would enable its reservoirs to recover over the winter .
it stressed the contingency plan would not be needed if a " prolonged wet spells fills up the reservoirs " .
winter is normally the time when reservoirs are re-filled but low rainfall recently has forced united utilities to consider alternative plans .
it argues that taking action now will have less of an impact on the river environment than if water is diverted during the spring or summer .
the problems in the north west mirror similar worries in yorkshire and southern england , where low rainfall has been aggravated by high domestic water consumption .

lake district around 12m people visit the area every year the deepest lake is wastwater at 74 metres -lrb- 243 feet -rrb- windermere is 62 metres -lrb- 203 feet -rrb- deep and ullswater 61 metres -lrb- 200 feet -rrb- deep the lakes provide homes for birds such as coots and mallards the biggest reservoir in the lake district is haweswater , which holds 18,600m gallons the inquiry on tuesday will hear from objectors who argue that any change in the water flow in the lakes will threaten fish and other fragile eco-systems .
the company said the measures , if granted , would enable its reservoirs to recover over the winter .
it stressed the contingency plan would not be needed if a " prolonged wet spells fills up the reservoirs " .
winter is normally the time when reservoirs are re-filled but low rainfall recently has forced united utilities to consider alternative plans .
it argues that taking action now will have less of an impact on the river environment than if water is diverted during the spring or summer .
the problems in the north west mirror similar worries in yorkshire and southern england , where low rainfall has been aggravated by high domestic water consumption .

bill chiasson is replaced by jim fogarty , a management consultant , who investors hope will lead a rethink .
levi strauss recently warned that full-year sales would drop by up to 7 % , amid concerns that debt is ballooning .
the firm has struggled in the face of intense competition from more youth-oriented brands .
" they realised everything they have tried has been to no avail , " said kurt barnard , president of barnard 's retail consulting group , " so it 's time to bring in some fresh blood . "
seeking assistance mr fogarty 's consulting firm , alvarez & marsal , is to work with levi strauss on a turnaround plan .
mr chiasson failed to turn around levi 's finances alvarez & marsal specialises in distressed companies , and mr fogarty was previously chief financial officer at warnaco group , which emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in february .
levi strauss 's net debt is estimated to approach $ 2.2bn by the end of the year .
the firm has already made strenuous efforts to revive its business , including closing north american factories , shedding thousands of jobs and repeatedly tinkering with its product range .
but its reputation has been tarnished not only by the failure to recapture its past glory , but also by errors in 1998-1999 tax returns and allegations of false accounting levelled by two former tax managers in a lawsuit .

the department of trade and industry and the welsh consumer council warn that consumer borrowing has rocketed to a level that is or could soon become unsustainable .
they are calling for more financial education for teenagers in schools and better support for citizens advice bureaux to try and avoid the problem .
claire whyley , head of research and policy at the welsh consumer council , said serious debt problems in the post-christmas period would be " a harsh reality for many consumers . "
" while many households in wales are managing their credit commitments without problems , a debt crisis in britain would have more serious consequences in wales , " he said . "
the report gives us a much clearer picture of the level , nature and extent of borrowing and debt among welsh households " edwina hart , am " it would affect more households and would , undoubtedly , be harder to recover from . "
the survey provides the first-ever statistically representative figures on the level and nature of credit use and indebtedness among households in wales .
it shows that 10 % of people in wales admit that they have borrowed more than they can afford to pay back .
eight in 10 welsh households have credit facilities - a higher proportion than the rest of britain .
it also reveals that poorer households , and those headed by lone parents , tend to be heavier borrowers .
the report states that the most popular type of credit is mail order and is used by one in four households .
this is followed by personal loans and credit cards .
edwina hart am , welsh assembly government minister for social justice and regeneration , described the report as an important contribution to the widespread concern about a possible debt crisis .
she added : " i am particularly pleased that the report gives us a much clearer picture of the level , nature and extent of borrowing and debt among welsh households .
" such information is vital in terms of our understanding of the issues and in guiding the work of the assembly government in its wider financial and social inclusion objectives . "

engineers who designed the computer system for the new headquarters of the spybase in cheltenham failed to realise how complex their computer systems had become .
giving evidence to the commons public accounts committee , gchq director david pepper explained when the plans were drawn up in the mid-1990s it was not understood how interdependent the computer systems had become .
earlier this year , a national audit office report revealed a failure to appreciate the difficulties involved meant the cost of the move to the so-called ' doughnut ' in cheltenham rocketed from an original estimate of £ 41m to £ 308m .
networking systems dr pepper said the original plans to transfer the computers were based on systems used during the cold war .
then , there was a relatively static threat from the soviet union and the different computer systems used by gchq staff did not have to interact .
but more complex threats facing the uk in the 1990s meant more " networking " between computer systems , making the move much more complicated .
" the engineers simply did n't spot the fact that the degree of networking was going to complicate enormously the process of transition , " he told the committee .
" it took some time before anybody stood back and said ' it is not going to work because of the networking ' . "
he said that it was only in 1998 , during work to protect gchq 's computers from the " millennium bug " , that the extent of the problem was realised .

to help out the family dairy firm as a teenager , he would get up in the pre-dawn chill to do the milkround .
now that he is managing director , he is still defiantly down to earth ; " i 'm just a milkman , " he shrugs .
a millionaire milkman , however : robert wiseman dairies , in which mr wiseman and his brother alan still have a 54 % stake , has grown with bewildering speed .
it now turns over more than £ 400m , employs 3,000 staff and controls 20 % of the uk milk market .
and the company 's most recent results were equally impressive : interim profits grew by 21 % to £ 13.5m.
it is no surprise that earlier in the year he was named uk entrepreneur of the year by accountants ernst and young .
brothers in arms mr wiseman has an impressive legacy to live up to .
the once-placid dairy business is hotting up the robert wiseman of the company 's name , the present boss 's father , sold his farmland in 1947 to become the designated milk distributor for the new town of east kilbride , on the southern fringe of glasgow .
the wiseman delivery schedule grew along with east kilbride , graduating in the process from a horse and cart to electric milk floats .
but it was when brothers alan and robert came on board in the 1970s that the firm took off .
they took the view - revolutionary at the time - that doorstep deliveries were in decline , and that the future was in supplying retailers .
spending up this shift called for heavy investment in new production , packaging and distribution facilities , at a time when bigger rivals such as dairy crest and express dairies were letting their plants age gracefully .
wiseman 's modern plants should survive any capacity cull wiseman also poured effort into branding , creating a highly distinctive black-and-white cowhide livery that runs from its cartons to its delivery trucks .
and because supermarkets kept driving down prices , the firm was forced to seek growth through acquisitions .
since the beginning of the 1980s , wiseman has taken over 54 companies .
the billion-bottle boys little wonder , then , that growth rates have been spectacular .
at the beginning of the 1990s , the company sold less than 100 million litres of milk ; this year , it surpassed 1 billion litres for the first time .
in 1994 , wiseman had 2 % of the uk market ; now , it has 20 % , with more than half its turnover coming from south of the border .
the firm 's shares , listed in london in 1994 , have more than doubled over the past three years , far outpacing its rivals .
wiseman has built a modern plant in manchester , and then one in droitwich , west midlands , in 2001 .
a map on the wall of mr wiseman 's office charts the southward march , showing the business heading towards the big area it has yet to penetrate - the teeming millions of london and the southeast .
liquid assets wiseman 's success , analysts say , is the result of the firm 's extraordinarily single-minded focus on its core business .
the firm has ruthlessly stripped away any distracting sidelines - tempting sources of added value such as cheese or yoghurt - from its business , leaving it only interested in selling liquid milk .
wiseman 's headquarters are still in the modest suburban farmhouse where mr wiseman senior set up shop ; the firm does not even have a website .
" it 's important to stick to what you know and not get sidelined , " says douglas nisbet , managing partner in scotland for ernst & young , which in october made mr wiseman its uk entrepreneur of the year .
" since their shares have been listed , it 's become especially important to be able to capture precisely what the firm is about in a couple of sentences . "
political problems but the once-placid dairy sector is becoming ever more problematic .
first , " the milk business is hugely political , " says professor donald mcqueen , a specialist in the dairy industry at glasgow university .
imminent reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy are likely to cause a dramatic fall in uk milk production , shaking up mr wiseman 's so-far amicable relations with suppliers .
and pressure on prices is pulling in several directions : farmers in particular are becoming more strident in their demands for a bigger slice of the profits .
regulators are nosing around eagerly : wiseman faces a probe by the competition commission into alleged price-fixing in a slice of its scottish business .
tightening up second , opportunities for growth are not as obvious as they were .
the market , says nicola mallard , analyst at investec securities , " is settling down into comfortable old age " .
the sector is no longer a pot of gold milk demand is at best stagnant , and no one expects it to pick up in the conceivable future .
in october , danish-based arla won permission to take over express dairies , creating a group which controls just over one-third of the british milk market .
with dairy crest controlling another 24 % and wiseman on 20 % , that does not leave a great deal of room for further acquisitions .
at ernst & young , mr nisbet warns that mr wiseman may face a challenge in keeping the business focused as it grows .
" you have to keep the culture and ethos of the organisation intact , " he says .
breathing space but mr wiseman could still be feasting on the cream for a while yet .
the arla merger is likely to see various bits and pieces come onto the market : the firms have pledged to cut their capacity by one-quarter , which will provide a steady stream of morsels for wiseman to snap up .
overall , the uk market has around 20 % overcapacity in dairy processing : the fact that wiseman , unlike its rivals , has modern , efficient plants means that it is unlikely to be pushed into cutting back production .
overall , says mr wiseman , " there is no reason why we should n't have 30 % of the market in the near future . "

the firm has ruthlessly stripped away any distracting sidelines - tempting sources of added value such as cheese or yoghurt - from its business , leaving it only interested in selling liquid milk .
wiseman 's headquarters are still in the modest suburban farmhouse where mr wiseman senior set up shop ; the firm does not even have a website .
" it 's important to stick to what you know and not get sidelined , " says douglas nisbet , managing partner in scotland for ernst & young , which in october made mr wiseman its uk entrepreneur of the year .

with dairy crest controlling another 24 % and wiseman on 20 % , that does not leave a great deal of room for further acquisitions .
at ernst & young , mr nisbet warns that mr wiseman may face a challenge in keeping the business focused as it grows .
" you have to keep the culture and ethos of the organisation intact , " he says .
breathing space but mr wiseman could still be feasting on the cream for a while yet .
the arla merger is likely to see various bits and pieces come onto the market : the firms have pledged to cut their capacity by one-quarter , which will provide a steady stream of morsels for wiseman to snap up .
overall , the uk market has around 20 % overcapacity in dairy processing : the fact that wiseman , unlike its rivals , has modern , efficient plants means that it is unlikely to be pushed into cutting back production .

to help out the family dairy firm as a teenager , he would get up in the pre-dawn chill to do the milkround .
now that he is managing director , he is still defiantly down to earth ; " i 'm just a milkman , " he shrugs .
a millionaire milkman , however : robert wiseman dairies , in which mr wiseman and his brother alan still have a 54 % stake , has grown with bewildering speed .
it now turns over more than £ 400m , employs 3,000 staff and controls 20 % of the uk milk market .
and the company 's most recent results were equally impressive : interim profits grew by 21 % to £ 13.5m.
it is no surprise that earlier in the year he was named uk entrepreneur of the year by accountants ernst and young .
brothers in arms mr wiseman has an impressive legacy to live up to .
the robert wiseman of the company 's name , the present boss 's father , sold his farmland in 1947 to become the designated milk distributor for the new town of east kilbride , on the southern fringe of glasgow .
the wiseman delivery schedule grew along with east kilbride , graduating in the process from a horse and cart to electric milk floats .
but it was when brothers alan and robert came on board in the 1970s that the firm took off .
they took the view - revolutionary at the time - that doorstep deliveries were in decline , and that the future was in supplying retailers .
spending up this shift called for heavy investment in new production , packaging and distribution facilities , at a time when bigger rivals such as dairy crest and express dairies were letting their plants age gracefully .
wiseman also poured effort into branding , creating a highly distinctive black-and-white cowhide livery that runs from its cartons to its delivery trucks .
and because supermarkets kept driving down prices , the firm was forced to seek growth through acquisitions .
since the beginning of the 1980s , wiseman has taken over 54 companies .
the billion-bottle boys little wonder , then , that growth rates have been spectacular .
at the beginning of the 1990s , the company sold less than 100 million litres of milk ; this year , it surpassed 1 billion litres for the first time .
in 1994 , wiseman had 2 % of the uk market ; now , it has 20 % , with more than half its turnover coming from south of the border .
the firm 's shares , listed in london in 1994 , have more than doubled over the past three years , far outpacing its rivals .
wiseman has built a modern plant in manchester , and then one in droitwich , west midlands , in 2001 .
a map on the wall of mr wiseman 's office charts the southward march , showing the business heading towards the big area it has yet to penetrate - the teeming millions of london and the southeast .
liquid assets wiseman 's success , analysts say , is the result of the firm 's extraordinarily single-minded focus on its core business .
the firm has ruthlessly stripped away any distracting sidelines - tempting sources of added value such as cheese or yoghurt - from its business , leaving it only interested in selling liquid milk .
wiseman 's headquarters are still in the modest suburban farmhouse where mr wiseman senior set up shop ; the firm does not even have a website .
" it 's important to stick to what you know and not get sidelined , " says douglas nisbet , managing partner in scotland for ernst & young , which in october made mr wiseman its uk entrepreneur of the year .
" since their shares have been listed , it 's become especially important to be able to capture precisely what the firm is about in a couple of sentences . "
political problems but the once-placid dairy sector is becoming ever more problematic .
first , " the milk business is hugely political , " says professor donald mcqueen , a specialist in the dairy industry at glasgow university .
imminent reforms to the eu 's common agricultural policy are likely to cause a dramatic fall in uk milk production , shaking up mr wiseman 's so-far amicable relations with suppliers .
and pressure on prices is pulling in several directions : farmers in particular are becoming more strident in their demands for a bigger slice of the profits .
regulators are nosing around eagerly : wiseman faces a probe by the competition commission into alleged price-fixing in a slice of its scottish business .
tightening up second , opportunities for growth are not as obvious as they were .
the market , says nicola mallard , analyst at investec securities , " is settling down into comfortable old age " .
milk demand is at best stagnant , and no one expects it to pick up in the conceivable future .
in october , danish-based arla won permission to take over express dairies , creating a group which controls just over one-third of the british milk market .
with dairy crest controlling another 24 % and wiseman on 20 % , that does not leave a great deal of room for further acquisitions .

next year 's economic expansion target will be 7 % , the people 's daily said economic planners had decided .
the most recent quarterly figures showed china 's economy swelling at 9 % a year , with 7.7 % the average since 1998 .
the paper said premier wen jiabao had told planners that growth was not the be all and end all , and that social development should also be a priority .
" co-ordinated development " was the key , he reportedly said in a meeting of the national development and reform commission , hinting at a more balanced approach than the breakneck rush for expansion of recent years .
imbalance the rapid growth has widened gaps between a burgeoning middle class and the urban and rural poor , and china 's rulers are worried about the possible fall-out .
at the same time , rampant investment - up a third this year - in sectors such as steel , cars and cement are straining the electricity network .
sizzling sectors of the economy such as luxury housing are being hit with lending curbs to try to stem activity .
meanwhile , the us is continuing to raise its voice about what it sees as an unfairly low exchange rate for the chinese yuan .
the white house says american jobs are being lost to unnaturally cheap chinese exports .
china has said it will move from its current peg to a freely floating currency , but hints it will not happen for some years .

ba is asking the government to build a third runway at heathrow rather than a second for stansted .
a new stansted runway would provide more capacity to low-cost rivals such as easyjet and ryanair .
the department of transport said no decision has yet been made on where to allow more runways in the south east .

ba says two extra runways for the south east could generate £ 65bn of economic benefits , but that expansion to stansted alone would be " disastrous " for the industry .
stiff competition " we are quite happy for a runway to be built at stansted - it will be very useful to the low cost airlines and freight companies which operate there , " andrew cahn , director of government and industry at ba , told bbc radio five live .

the report said al-qaeda ideology had continued to spread , raising the spectre of further attacks .
sanctions against al-qaeda were proving difficult to implement fully , the un panel of experts said .
and they warned that united nations member states were not doing enough to crack down on terror groups .
" many of al-qaeda 's sources of funding have not yet been uncovered or blocked , " the report said .
the risk of al-qaeda acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction ... continues to grow un report " al-qaeda continues to have access to funds through charities , deep-pocket donors and from business and criminal activities , including the drug trade . "
michael chandler , who chairs the un monitoring group , said he did not think a biological attack was necessarily imminent .
but he told the bbc 's world today programme the signs were there that al-qaeda wanted to use such tactics .
" it is probably the fact that they are looking for some technical means of dispersion rather than actually the stuff itself , " he said .
" the ingredients are available if they want to get hold of them . "
call for tougher rules until now the monitoring committee has relied on un member states to volunteer information about how they are limiting the activities of al-qaeda and associated groups .
al-qaeda / taleban sanctions arms embargo asset freeze travel ban but fewer than half of all member states are co-operating and even the quality of the information provided by those states is being questioned , the un report said .
it called on the un security council to pass a resolution that would compel nations to co-operate more fully .
" without a much tougher and more comprehensive resolution ... little or no progress will be achieved with regard to the sanctions regime imposed on osama bin laden , al-qaeda , the taleban , their associates and associated entities , " the report said .
the report said that while great importance had been attached to limiting the movement of al-qaeda operatives between countries , so far not a single un member state had presented any evidence of the arrest or detention of such people at border crossings .

the surprise result saw mr latham beat former leader kim beazley by 47 to 45 .
the vote came after leader simon crean resigned last week following a collapse in support from party members in the run-up to next year 's election .
prime minister john howard , serving his third term in office , remains hugely popular , buoyed by tough domestic and foreign policies and a healthy economy .
after winning the leadership , mr latham , 42 , told a news conference that he wanted to restore equality to australians .
" my aim will be to put the rungs of healthcare , education , early childhood development , decent services , back into that ladder of opportunity , " he said .
labor has traditionally viewed itself as the australian political party most committed to forging links with asia , but mr latham has virtually no foreign policy experience .
his only reference to foreign affairs during the news conference was a commitment to win the international war on terror .
brawl mr latham has strongly criticised the war in iraq , and earlier this year used coarse language in an interview to describe mr howard 's close relationship with the us .
he also told parliament in march that george w bush was " the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory . "
he defended his remark but has promised to tone down his plain speaking , saying " no more crudity . "
he also achieved notoriety after a brawl in which he broke a taxi driver 's arm in a row over a fare .
tuesday 's leadership vote came just five months after mr crean beat off a leadership challenge from mr beazley , the former party leader .
the election of mr latham has prompted speculation that the prime minister , john howard , could call an early election to take advantage of the new opposition leader 's relative inexperience .

the surprise result saw mr latham beat former leader kim beazley by 47 to 45 .
the vote came after leader simon crean resigned last week following a collapse in support from party members in the run-up to next year 's election .
prime minister john howard , serving his third term in office , remains hugely popular , buoyed by tough domestic and foreign policies and a healthy economy .
after winning the leadership , mr latham , 42 , told a news conference that he wanted to restore equality to australians .
" my aim will be to put the rungs of healthcare , education , early childhood development , decent services , back into that ladder of opportunity , " he said .
labor has traditionally viewed itself as the australian political party most committed to forging links with asia , but mr latham has virtually no foreign policy experience .
his only reference to foreign affairs during the news conference was a commitment to win the international war on terror .
brawl mr latham has strongly criticised the war in iraq , and earlier this year used coarse language in an interview to describe mr howard 's close relationship with the us .
he also told parliament in march that george w bush was " the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory . "
he defended his remark but has promised to tone down his plain speaking , saying " no more crudity . "
he also achieved notoriety after a brawl in which he broke a taxi driver 's arm in a row over a fare .
tuesday 's leadership vote came just five months after mr crean beat off a leadership challenge from mr beazley , the former party leader .
the election of mr latham has prompted speculation that the prime minister , john howard , could call an early election to take advantage of the new opposition leader 's relative inexperience .

the rich pockets of marine life were discovered by a devon wildlife trust survey in lyme bay .
the european union-funded sonar and video survey was carried out this autumn at beer home ground , a fishing area about three miles from the devon coast .
the results have amazed marine experts at the trust , who feared dredging for scallops might have completely degraded the area .
lyme bay reefs project officer richard stanford said : " dredging has definitely damaged the area , but thankfully there are large pockets of seabed which have not been dredged .
" these pockets hold a very rich , very diverse range of marine life .
" there were dense colonies of corals like the nationally-protected pink sea fan , and in one area several hectares were packed with an underwater forest of brittle stars , a kind of starfish . "
large shoals of fish , ross corals and sea sponges were spotted as well .
mr stanford said local fishermen , who had fished the area for decades , were also amazed as , for the first time , they saw with their own eyes what the reefs actually looked like .
mini submarine he said : " there was some concern that there was nowhere in beer home ground that had not been dredged .
" the starting point for doing the survey was the fishermen saying there was probably nothing there worth protecting . "
a mini-submarine carrying the sonar was towed behind a boat and a video camera pulled along on a line just above the sea bed .
the survey is the latest effort by the wildlife trust to work with fishermen to protect the area known as the lyme bay reefs .
two nearby areas have already been closed to fishing through agreement with the fishermen .
funding for that work has come from defra , english nature and devon county council .

lyme bay reefs project officer richard stanford said : " dredging has definitely damaged the area , but thankfully there are large pockets of seabed which have not been dredged .
marine experts feared dredging might have degraded the area " these pockets hold a very rich , very diverse range of marine life .
" there were dense colonies of corals like the nationally-protected pink sea fan , and in one area several hectares were packed with an underwater forest of brittle stars , a kind of starfish . "
large shoals of fish , ross corals and sea sponges were spotted as well .
mr stanford said local fishermen , who had fished the area for decades , were also amazed as , for the first time , they saw with their own eyes what the reefs actually looked like .
mini submarine he said : " there was some concern that there was nowhere in beer home ground that had not been dredged .
" the starting point for doing the survey was the fishermen saying there was probably nothing there worth protecting . "
a mini-submarine carrying the sonar was towed behind a boat and a video camera pulled along on a line just above the sea bed .
the survey is the latest effort by the wildlife trust to work with fishermen to protect the area known as the lyme bay reefs .
two nearby areas have already been closed to fishing through agreement with the fishermen .
funding for that work has come from defra , english nature and devon county council .

they decided to scrap the project because the costs were mounting and it was unpopular with locals .
the motion - which was carried by 24 votes to 18 - was made " in view of the real concerns expressed by the public " .
work was due to start on the project , which has been in the pipeline for seven years , next summer .
