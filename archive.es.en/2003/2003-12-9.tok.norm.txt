a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry . take a stroll down the radio dial in germany and you might get confused about what country you ’ re in .
news and talk is in german , mostly , but the music is overwhelmingly sung in the language of shakespeare or , rather , a rock or pop version of it .
ask any german young person what they like to listen to and it ’ s far more likely they ’ ll know latest song by american pop music idols justin timberlake or christina aguilera than releases by german acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nena now a coalition of artists , music industry representatives , economists and self-styled defenders of the german language are now saying enough is enough and that it ’ s time that the german radio landscape became a little more teutonic .
they are demanding the introduction of a music quota for radio stations that would require their deejays to play 40 percent german music — less britney , more nena -lrb- photo -rrb- . “ there are many talented people in germany who often sing in their mother tongue .
but it looks as if there are fewer and fewer radio stations that are prepared to fit them into their programs , ” wrote gerd gebhardt , chairman of the german phono association , on his organization 's web site . “ love ” not “ liebe ” the amount of german music on german radio is miniscule .
on pop music stations , only 1.2 percent of the songs played are in german , or about one in a hundred .
among public broadcasters , who are seen in germany as having a cultural duty to fulfil , the numbers are slightly better , but not by much .
german-language pop and rock makes up just six percent of their playlists . “ no other country in the world is so indifferent towards its language as germany , ” said gebhardt .
“ german-language music urgently requires platforms where it can be presented to its audience . ” the call for more musik on german radio is more than just a paroxysm of national pride .
according to quota proponents , there are economic reasons behind it .
besides the big conglomerates like universal or the bertelsmann-owned bmg , most of the music sector in germany is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises .
they are the ones who suffer when the german-language artists on their labels don ’ t get airplay .
a lack of radio time means these homegrown artists remain largely unknown to the larger public .
their cds gather dust on store shelves and smaller production companies watch as insolvency looms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girl group " no angels " this market phenomenon has also pushed many german artists to forego their native tongue all together .
popular acts like no angels -lrb- photo -rrb- , bro ’ sis , and jeannette biedermann all sing in english .
only a few well-known artists , like ben and xavier naidoo , choose to croon auf deutsch . “ it ’ s simply impoverishment , ” german songwriter reinhard mey , who is among the most vocal proponents of the quota , told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ there is no way getting past putting a quota system -lrb- in place -rrb- , ” he said , which would provide badly needed assistance to a cultural and economic sector that is being drown out by “ anglo-american mass production . ” french example proponents point to their western neighbors , the french , who implemented a quota system eight years ago , which requires stations to play 40 percent french music including 20 percent new artists or new releases . “ france has shown us very clearly how such a system can work .
since the introduction of the 40 percent quota in 1995 , the french music industry has seen sales increase markedly .
at the same time , the german music industry has lost a quarter of its market , ” said mario ohoven , president of the federal association of small and medium-sized companies . the french government , which has a tradition of vehemently protecting its cultural players and institutions , has helped in other ways to increase domestic music sales .
french artists receive social security , unemployment benefits , and subsidies for touring and rehearsal spaces .
a 3.5 percent tax is levied on all concert box office sales and the revenue is used to support new artists , the export of music , and even the purchase of new equipment for artists . public wants it according to the german language association , which is an advocate for both more german on the radio and fewer english words in german , the public is ready to hear its own artists and its own language on the airwaves .
a poll that was conducted in april of this year found that 62 percent of those asked want more music with german lyrics . they aren ’ t alone .
across the world , the international federation of the phonographic industry points to the emergence of new sales patterns , with the sales of american artists beginning to decline across the world .
while 93 percent of sales in the u.s. market come from domestic artists , in 2001 , sales of local repertoires across the world grew to 67.5 percent .
this shift in buying patterns has caused other broadcasters to change their music strategies , even without quotas enforced from above .
mtv asia has begun shunning international acts to play up to 90 percent domestic music in each of the countries in which it broadcasts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to be britney a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.12.2003 italy 's constitutional court considers immunity law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi may soon find his legal immunity reversed just weeks before italy gives up its rotating presidency of the eu , the country 's constitutional court is to rule on whether to overturn a law which ensures legal immunity for prime minister silvio berlusconi . earlier this year , the italian parliament approved legislation that made the prime minister immune from prosecution for as long as he remained in office .
if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.12.2003 report clears daimlerchrysler of human rights violations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes the report clears it of its shadowy past .
a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.12.2003 eu turns blind eye to berlin-beijing nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready to head to china ? - the plutonium plant in hanu , near frankfurt .
schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder stands in front of a painting of the great wall as he waits for wu bangguo , chairman of the national people 's congress , in beijing , tuesday , dec .

-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .

the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .
new elections are likely in february . hamburg mayor ole von beust , a christian democrat , said on tuesday he could no longer rely on a majority in the city-state 's parliament .
he added that continued infighting among party members of the coalition ’ s junior partner threatened the city ’ s image . “ i can ’ t accept that the city ’ s reputation and dignity are being questioned , ” beust said . party seeks to expel founder at the center of the fall-out stands ronald schill , who is the founder of the populist right-wing schill party and served as hamburg ’ s interior minister until last august .
beust had dismissed the former judge after he allegedly threatened to disclose the mayor 's homosexuality over a personnel dispute . schill disappeared from the headlines for several months , but reemerged recently when the hamburg chapter of his party reelected him as its leader .
the national leadership deposed schill over the weekend , prompting that man once known as “ judge merciless ” to chair a party meeting at the same time as a another meeting endorsed by the party ’ s national leadership took place . as a result , schill threatened to depose national party leader mario mettbach , who also serves as hamburg ’ s deputy mayor .
mettbach in turn announced on tuesday that the party leadership would start proceedings to revoke schill ’ s party membership . “ we regret this , but i ’ m happy this farce is over , ” mettbach said after he , beust and a representative of the free liberal democrats , the third coalition partner , announced the government ’ s break-up . little change expected nationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust now faces an early re-election campaign .

english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry . take a stroll down the radio dial in germany and you might get confused about what country you ’ re in .
news and talk is in german , mostly , but the music is overwhelmingly sung in the language of shakespeare or , rather , a rock or pop version of it .
ask any german young person what they like to listen to and it ’ s far more likely they ’ ll know latest song by american pop music idols justin timberlake or christina aguilera than releases by german acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nena now a coalition of artists , music industry representatives , economists and self-styled defenders of the german language are now saying enough is enough and that it ’ s time that the german radio landscape became a little more teutonic .
they are demanding the introduction of a music quota for radio stations that would require their deejays to play 40 percent german music — less britney , more nena -lrb- photo -rrb- . “ there are many talented people in germany who often sing in their mother tongue .
but it looks as if there are fewer and fewer radio stations that are prepared to fit them into their programs , ” wrote gerd gebhardt , chairman of the german phono association , on his organization 's web site . “ love ” not “ liebe ” the amount of german music on german radio is miniscule .
on pop music stations , only 1.2 percent of the songs played are in german , or about one in a hundred .
among public broadcasters , who are seen in germany as having a cultural duty to fulfil , the numbers are slightly better , but not by much .
german-language pop and rock makes up just six percent of their playlists . “ no other country in the world is so indifferent towards its language as germany , ” said gebhardt .
“ german-language music urgently requires platforms where it can be presented to its audience . ” the call for more musik on german radio is more than just a paroxysm of national pride .
according to quota proponents , there are economic reasons behind it .
besides the big conglomerates like universal or the bertelsmann-owned bmg , most of the music sector in germany is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises .
they are the ones who suffer when the german-language artists on their labels don ’ t get airplay .
a lack of radio time means these homegrown artists remain largely unknown to the larger public .
their cds gather dust on store shelves and smaller production companies watch as insolvency looms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girl group " no angels " this market phenomenon has also pushed many german artists to forego their native tongue all together .
popular acts like no angels -lrb- photo -rrb- , bro ’ sis , and jeannette biedermann all sing in english .
only a few well-known artists , like ben and xavier naidoo , choose to croon auf deutsch . “ it ’ s simply impoverishment , ” german songwriter reinhard mey , who is among the most vocal proponents of the quota , told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ there is no way getting past putting a quota system -lrb- in place -rrb- , ” he said , which would provide badly needed assistance to a cultural and economic sector that is being drown out by “ anglo-american mass production . ” french example proponents point to their western neighbors , the french , who implemented a quota system eight years ago , which requires stations to play 40 percent french music including 20 percent new artists or new releases . “ france has shown us very clearly how such a system can work .
since the introduction of the 40 percent quota in 1995 , the french music industry has seen sales increase markedly .
at the same time , the german music industry has lost a quarter of its market , ” said mario ohoven , president of the federal association of small and medium-sized companies . the french government , which has a tradition of vehemently protecting its cultural players and institutions , has helped in other ways to increase domestic music sales .
french artists receive social security , unemployment benefits , and subsidies for touring and rehearsal spaces .
a 3.5 percent tax is levied on all concert box office sales and the revenue is used to support new artists , the export of music , and even the purchase of new equipment for artists . public wants it according to the german language association , which is an advocate for both more german on the radio and fewer english words in german , the public is ready to hear its own artists and its own language on the airwaves .
a poll that was conducted in april of this year found that 62 percent of those asked want more music with german lyrics . they aren ’ t alone .
across the world , the international federation of the phonographic industry points to the emergence of new sales patterns , with the sales of american artists beginning to decline across the world .
while 93 percent of sales in the u.s. market come from domestic artists , in 2001 , sales of local repertoires across the world grew to 67.5 percent .
this shift in buying patterns has caused other broadcasters to change their music strategies , even without quotas enforced from above .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.12.2003 italy 's constitutional court considers immunity law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi may soon find his legal immunity reversed just weeks before italy gives up its rotating presidency of the eu , the country 's constitutional court is to rule on whether to overturn a law which ensures legal immunity for prime minister silvio berlusconi . earlier this year , the italian parliament approved legislation that made the prime minister immune from prosecution for as long as he remained in office .
if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.12.2003 eu turns blind eye to berlin-beijing nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready to head to china ? - the plutonium plant in hanu , near frankfurt .
schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .

shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .
new elections are likely in february . hamburg mayor ole von beust , a christian democrat , said on tuesday he could no longer rely on a majority in the city-state 's parliament .
he added that continued infighting among party members of the coalition ’ s junior partner threatened the city ’ s image . “ i can ’ t accept that the city ’ s reputation and dignity are being questioned , ” beust said . party seeks to expel founder at the center of the fall-out stands ronald schill , who is the founder of the populist right-wing schill party and served as hamburg ’ s interior minister until last august .
beust had dismissed the former judge after he allegedly threatened to disclose the mayor 's homosexuality over a personnel dispute . schill disappeared from the headlines for several months , but reemerged recently when the hamburg chapter of his party reelected him as its leader .
the national leadership deposed schill over the weekend , prompting that man once known as “ judge merciless ” to chair a party meeting at the same time as a another meeting endorsed by the party ’ s national leadership took place . as a result , schill threatened to depose national party leader mario mettbach , who also serves as hamburg ’ s deputy mayor .
mettbach in turn announced on tuesday that the party leadership would start proceedings to revoke schill ’ s party membership . “ we regret this , but i ’ m happy this farce is over , ” mettbach said after he , beust and a representative of the free liberal democrats , the third coalition partner , announced the government ’ s break-up . little change expected nationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust now faces an early re-election campaign .
though beust said he was relaxed about the idea of entering a reelection campaign , opinion polls suggest social democrats could regain power with the help of the green party .
in 2001 , schill ’ s unexpected success with voters had put christian democrats into office after more than 40 years of social democratic rule in the city . after losing several state elections , a hamburg victory would boost morale among social democrats and greens .
but they would not regain power in germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , because hamburg only has three votes in the 69-member body .
the conservative states control 41 seats and are therefore able to block government proposals such as current plans to lower taxes and revamp germany ’ s labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no more mercy for hamburg 's ' judge merciless ' hamburg 's controversial interior minister has lost his job .
mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him .
-lrb- aug.19 , 2003 -rrb- feedback should hamburg 's christian democrats reenter a coalition with the schill party if it brings them back to power after new elections ?

but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry . take a stroll down the radio dial in germany and you might get confused about what country you ’ re in .
news and talk is in german , mostly , but the music is overwhelmingly sung in the language of shakespeare or , rather , a rock or pop version of it .
ask any german young person what they like to listen to and it ’ s far more likely they ’ ll know latest song by american pop music idols justin timberlake or christina aguilera than releases by german acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nena now a coalition of artists , music industry representatives , economists and self-styled defenders of the german language are now saying enough is enough and that it ’ s time that the german radio landscape became a little more teutonic .
they are demanding the introduction of a music quota for radio stations that would require their deejays to play 40 percent german music — less britney , more nena -lrb- photo -rrb- . “ there are many talented people in germany who often sing in their mother tongue .
but it looks as if there are fewer and fewer radio stations that are prepared to fit them into their programs , ” wrote gerd gebhardt , chairman of the german phono association , on his organization 's web site . “ love ” not “ liebe ” the amount of german music on german radio is miniscule .
on pop music stations , only 1.2 percent of the songs played are in german , or about one in a hundred .
among public broadcasters , who are seen in germany as having a cultural duty to fulfil , the numbers are slightly better , but not by much .
german-language pop and rock makes up just six percent of their playlists . “ no other country in the world is so indifferent towards its language as germany , ” said gebhardt .
“ german-language music urgently requires platforms where it can be presented to its audience . ” the call for more musik on german radio is more than just a paroxysm of national pride .
according to quota proponents , there are economic reasons behind it .
besides the big conglomerates like universal or the bertelsmann-owned bmg , most of the music sector in germany is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises .
they are the ones who suffer when the german-language artists on their labels don ’ t get airplay .
a lack of radio time means these homegrown artists remain largely unknown to the larger public .
their cds gather dust on store shelves and smaller production companies watch as insolvency looms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girl group " no angels " this market phenomenon has also pushed many german artists to forego their native tongue all together .
popular acts like no angels -lrb- photo -rrb- , bro ’ sis , and jeannette biedermann all sing in english .
only a few well-known artists , like ben and xavier naidoo , choose to croon auf deutsch . “ it ’ s simply impoverishment , ” german songwriter reinhard mey , who is among the most vocal proponents of the quota , told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ there is no way getting past putting a quota system -lrb- in place -rrb- , ” he said , which would provide badly needed assistance to a cultural and economic sector that is being drown out by “ anglo-american mass production . ” french example proponents point to their western neighbors , the french , who implemented a quota system eight years ago , which requires stations to play 40 percent french music including 20 percent new artists or new releases . “ france has shown us very clearly how such a system can work .
since the introduction of the 40 percent quota in 1995 , the french music industry has seen sales increase markedly .
at the same time , the german music industry has lost a quarter of its market , ” said mario ohoven , president of the federal association of small and medium-sized companies . the french government , which has a tradition of vehemently protecting its cultural players and institutions , has helped in other ways to increase domestic music sales .
french artists receive social security , unemployment benefits , and subsidies for touring and rehearsal spaces .
a 3.5 percent tax is levied on all concert box office sales and the revenue is used to support new artists , the export of music , and even the purchase of new equipment for artists . public wants it according to the german language association , which is an advocate for both more german on the radio and fewer english words in german , the public is ready to hear its own artists and its own language on the airwaves .
a poll that was conducted in april of this year found that 62 percent of those asked want more music with german lyrics . they aren ’ t alone .
across the world , the international federation of the phonographic industry points to the emergence of new sales patterns , with the sales of american artists beginning to decline across the world .
while 93 percent of sales in the u.s. market come from domestic artists , in 2001 , sales of local repertoires across the world grew to 67.5 percent .
this shift in buying patterns has caused other broadcasters to change their music strategies , even without quotas enforced from above .
mtv asia has begun shunning international acts to play up to 90 percent domestic music in each of the countries in which it broadcasts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to be britney a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry . take a stroll down the radio dial in germany and you might get confused about what country you ’ re in .
news and talk is in german , mostly , but the music is overwhelmingly sung in the language of shakespeare or , rather , a rock or pop version of it .
ask any german young person what they like to listen to and it ’ s far more likely they ’ ll know latest song by american pop music idols justin timberlake or christina aguilera than releases by german acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nena now a coalition of artists , music industry representatives , economists and self-styled defenders of the german language are now saying enough is enough and that it ’ s time that the german radio landscape became a little more teutonic .
they are demanding the introduction of a music quota for radio stations that would require their deejays to play 40 percent german music — less britney , more nena -lrb- photo -rrb- . “ there are many talented people in germany who often sing in their mother tongue .
but it looks as if there are fewer and fewer radio stations that are prepared to fit them into their programs , ” wrote gerd gebhardt , chairman of the german phono association , on his organization 's web site . “ love ” not “ liebe ” the amount of german music on german radio is miniscule .
on pop music stations , only 1.2 percent of the songs played are in german , or about one in a hundred .
among public broadcasters , who are seen in germany as having a cultural duty to fulfil , the numbers are slightly better , but not by much .
german-language pop and rock makes up just six percent of their playlists . “ no other country in the world is so indifferent towards its language as germany , ” said gebhardt .
“ german-language music urgently requires platforms where it can be presented to its audience . ” the call for more musik on german radio is more than just a paroxysm of national pride .
according to quota proponents , there are economic reasons behind it .
besides the big conglomerates like universal or the bertelsmann-owned bmg , most of the music sector in germany is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises .
they are the ones who suffer when the german-language artists on their labels don ’ t get airplay .
a lack of radio time means these homegrown artists remain largely unknown to the larger public .
their cds gather dust on store shelves and smaller production companies watch as insolvency looms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girl group " no angels " this market phenomenon has also pushed many german artists to forego their native tongue all together .

only a few well-known artists , like ben and xavier naidoo , choose to croon auf deutsch . “ it ’ s simply impoverishment , ” german songwriter reinhard mey , who is among the most vocal proponents of the quota , told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ there is no way getting past putting a quota system -lrb- in place -rrb- , ” he said , which would provide badly needed assistance to a cultural and economic sector that is being drown out by “ anglo-american mass production . ” french example proponents point to their western neighbors , the french , who implemented a quota system eight years ago , which requires stations to play 40 percent french music including 20 percent new artists or new releases . “ france has shown us very clearly how such a system can work .
since the introduction of the 40 percent quota in 1995 , the french music industry has seen sales increase markedly .
at the same time , the german music industry has lost a quarter of its market , ” said mario ohoven , president of the federal association of small and medium-sized companies . the french government , which has a tradition of vehemently protecting its cultural players and institutions , has helped in other ways to increase domestic music sales .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .

shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .
new elections are likely in february . hamburg mayor ole von beust , a christian democrat , said on tuesday he could no longer rely on a majority in the city-state 's parliament .
he added that continued infighting among party members of the coalition ’ s junior partner threatened the city ’ s image . “ i can ’ t accept that the city ’ s reputation and dignity are being questioned , ” beust said . party seeks to expel founder at the center of the fall-out stands ronald schill , who is the founder of the populist right-wing schill party and served as hamburg ’ s interior minister until last august .
beust had dismissed the former judge after he allegedly threatened to disclose the mayor 's homosexuality over a personnel dispute . schill disappeared from the headlines for several months , but reemerged recently when the hamburg chapter of his party reelected him as its leader .
the national leadership deposed schill over the weekend , prompting that man once known as “ judge merciless ” to chair a party meeting at the same time as a another meeting endorsed by the party ’ s national leadership took place . as a result , schill threatened to depose national party leader mario mettbach , who also serves as hamburg ’ s deputy mayor .
mettbach in turn announced on tuesday that the party leadership would start proceedings to revoke schill ’ s party membership . “ we regret this , but i ’ m happy this farce is over , ” mettbach said after he , beust and a representative of the free liberal democrats , the third coalition partner , announced the government ’ s break-up . little change expected nationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust now faces an early re-election campaign .
though beust said he was relaxed about the idea of entering a reelection campaign , opinion polls suggest social democrats could regain power with the help of the green party .
in 2001 , schill ’ s unexpected success with voters had put christian democrats into office after more than 40 years of social democratic rule in the city . after losing several state elections , a hamburg victory would boost morale among social democrats and greens .
but they would not regain power in germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , because hamburg only has three votes in the 69-member body .
the conservative states control 41 seats and are therefore able to block government proposals such as current plans to lower taxes and revamp germany ’ s labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no more mercy for hamburg 's ' judge merciless ' hamburg 's controversial interior minister has lost his job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.12.2003 eu turns blind eye to berlin-beijing nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready to head to china ? - the plutonium plant in hanu , near frankfurt .
schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder stands in front of a painting of the great wall as he waits for wu bangguo , chairman of the national people 's congress , in beijing , tuesday , dec .
2 , 2003 schroeder is on a five-day trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .
" obviously it takes more than one member state to shift this .

though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .
" obviously it takes more than one member state to shift this .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .

a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .

english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry . take a stroll down the radio dial in germany and you might get confused about what country you ’ re in .
news and talk is in german , mostly , but the music is overwhelmingly sung in the language of shakespeare or , rather , a rock or pop version of it .
ask any german young person what they like to listen to and it ’ s far more likely they ’ ll know latest song by american pop music idols justin timberlake or christina aguilera than releases by german acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nena now a coalition of artists , music industry representatives , economists and self-styled defenders of the german language are now saying enough is enough and that it ’ s time that the german radio landscape became a little more teutonic .
they are demanding the introduction of a music quota for radio stations that would require their deejays to play 40 percent german music — less britney , more nena -lrb- photo -rrb- . “ there are many talented people in germany who often sing in their mother tongue .
but it looks as if there are fewer and fewer radio stations that are prepared to fit them into their programs , ” wrote gerd gebhardt , chairman of the german phono association , on his organization 's web site . “ love ” not “ liebe ” the amount of german music on german radio is miniscule .
on pop music stations , only 1.2 percent of the songs played are in german , or about one in a hundred .
among public broadcasters , who are seen in germany as having a cultural duty to fulfil , the numbers are slightly better , but not by much .
german-language pop and rock makes up just six percent of their playlists . “ no other country in the world is so indifferent towards its language as germany , ” said gebhardt .
“ german-language music urgently requires platforms where it can be presented to its audience . ” the call for more musik on german radio is more than just a paroxysm of national pride .
according to quota proponents , there are economic reasons behind it .
besides the big conglomerates like universal or the bertelsmann-owned bmg , most of the music sector in germany is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises .
they are the ones who suffer when the german-language artists on their labels don ’ t get airplay .
a lack of radio time means these homegrown artists remain largely unknown to the larger public .
their cds gather dust on store shelves and smaller production companies watch as insolvency looms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girl group " no angels " this market phenomenon has also pushed many german artists to forego their native tongue all together .
popular acts like no angels -lrb- photo -rrb- , bro ’ sis , and jeannette biedermann all sing in english .
only a few well-known artists , like ben and xavier naidoo , choose to croon auf deutsch . “ it ’ s simply impoverishment , ” german songwriter reinhard mey , who is among the most vocal proponents of the quota , told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ there is no way getting past putting a quota system -lrb- in place -rrb- , ” he said , which would provide badly needed assistance to a cultural and economic sector that is being drown out by “ anglo-american mass production . ” french example proponents point to their western neighbors , the french , who implemented a quota system eight years ago , which requires stations to play 40 percent french music including 20 percent new artists or new releases . “ france has shown us very clearly how such a system can work .
since the introduction of the 40 percent quota in 1995 , the french music industry has seen sales increase markedly .
at the same time , the german music industry has lost a quarter of its market , ” said mario ohoven , president of the federal association of small and medium-sized companies . the french government , which has a tradition of vehemently protecting its cultural players and institutions , has helped in other ways to increase domestic music sales .
french artists receive social security , unemployment benefits , and subsidies for touring and rehearsal spaces .
a 3.5 percent tax is levied on all concert box office sales and the revenue is used to support new artists , the export of music , and even the purchase of new equipment for artists . public wants it according to the german language association , which is an advocate for both more german on the radio and fewer english words in german , the public is ready to hear its own artists and its own language on the airwaves .
a poll that was conducted in april of this year found that 62 percent of those asked want more music with german lyrics . they aren ’ t alone .
across the world , the international federation of the phonographic industry points to the emergence of new sales patterns , with the sales of american artists beginning to decline across the world .
while 93 percent of sales in the u.s. market come from domestic artists , in 2001 , sales of local repertoires across the world grew to 67.5 percent .
this shift in buying patterns has caused other broadcasters to change their music strategies , even without quotas enforced from above .
mtv asia has begun shunning international acts to play up to 90 percent domestic music in each of the countries in which it broadcasts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to be britney a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .

the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.12.2003 report clears daimlerchrysler of human rights violations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler hopes the report clears it of its shadowy past .
a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.12.2003 eu turns blind eye to berlin-beijing nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready to head to china ? - the plutonium plant in hanu , near frankfurt .
schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder stands in front of a painting of the great wall as he waits for wu bangguo , chairman of the national people 's congress , in beijing , tuesday , dec .
2 , 2003 schroeder is on a five-day trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .
" obviously it takes more than one member state to shift this .

shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .
new elections are likely in february . hamburg mayor ole von beust , a christian democrat , said on tuesday he could no longer rely on a majority in the city-state 's parliament .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .
new elections are likely in february . hamburg mayor ole von beust , a christian democrat , said on tuesday he could no longer rely on a majority in the city-state 's parliament .
he added that continued infighting among party members of the coalition ’ s junior partner threatened the city ’ s image . “ i can ’ t accept that the city ’ s reputation and dignity are being questioned , ” beust said . party seeks to expel founder at the center of the fall-out stands ronald schill , who is the founder of the populist right-wing schill party and served as hamburg ’ s interior minister until last august .
beust had dismissed the former judge after he allegedly threatened to disclose the mayor 's homosexuality over a personnel dispute . schill disappeared from the headlines for several months , but reemerged recently when the hamburg chapter of his party reelected him as its leader .
the national leadership deposed schill over the weekend , prompting that man once known as “ judge merciless ” to chair a party meeting at the same time as a another meeting endorsed by the party ’ s national leadership took place . as a result , schill threatened to depose national party leader mario mettbach , who also serves as hamburg ’ s deputy mayor .
mettbach in turn announced on tuesday that the party leadership would start proceedings to revoke schill ’ s party membership . “ we regret this , but i ’ m happy this farce is over , ” mettbach said after he , beust and a representative of the free liberal democrats , the third coalition partner , announced the government ’ s break-up . little change expected nationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust now faces an early re-election campaign .

english-language music dominates the airwaves in germany .
but some are calling for a radio quota that would force stations to play more german songs , saying it would help homegrown artists and the local music industry . take a stroll down the radio dial in germany and you might get confused about what country you ’ re in .
news and talk is in german , mostly , but the music is overwhelmingly sung in the language of shakespeare or , rather , a rock or pop version of it .
ask any german young person what they like to listen to and it ’ s far more likely they ’ ll know latest song by american pop music idols justin timberlake or christina aguilera than releases by german acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nena now a coalition of artists , music industry representatives , economists and self-styled defenders of the german language are now saying enough is enough and that it ’ s time that the german radio landscape became a little more teutonic .
they are demanding the introduction of a music quota for radio stations that would require their deejays to play 40 percent german music — less britney , more nena -lrb- photo -rrb- . “ there are many talented people in germany who often sing in their mother tongue .
but it looks as if there are fewer and fewer radio stations that are prepared to fit them into their programs , ” wrote gerd gebhardt , chairman of the german phono association , on his organization 's web site . “ love ” not “ liebe ” the amount of german music on german radio is miniscule .
on pop music stations , only 1.2 percent of the songs played are in german , or about one in a hundred .
among public broadcasters , who are seen in germany as having a cultural duty to fulfil , the numbers are slightly better , but not by much .
german-language pop and rock makes up just six percent of their playlists . “ no other country in the world is so indifferent towards its language as germany , ” said gebhardt .
“ german-language music urgently requires platforms where it can be presented to its audience . ” the call for more musik on german radio is more than just a paroxysm of national pride .
according to quota proponents , there are economic reasons behind it .
besides the big conglomerates like universal or the bertelsmann-owned bmg , most of the music sector in germany is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises .
they are the ones who suffer when the german-language artists on their labels don ’ t get airplay .
a lack of radio time means these homegrown artists remain largely unknown to the larger public .
their cds gather dust on store shelves and smaller production companies watch as insolvency looms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girl group " no angels " this market phenomenon has also pushed many german artists to forego their native tongue all together .
popular acts like no angels -lrb- photo -rrb- , bro ’ sis , and jeannette biedermann all sing in english .
only a few well-known artists , like ben and xavier naidoo , choose to croon auf deutsch . “ it ’ s simply impoverishment , ” german songwriter reinhard mey , who is among the most vocal proponents of the quota , told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ there is no way getting past putting a quota system -lrb- in place -rrb- , ” he said , which would provide badly needed assistance to a cultural and economic sector that is being drown out by “ anglo-american mass production . ” french example proponents point to their western neighbors , the french , who implemented a quota system eight years ago , which requires stations to play 40 percent french music including 20 percent new artists or new releases . “ france has shown us very clearly how such a system can work .
since the introduction of the 40 percent quota in 1995 , the french music industry has seen sales increase markedly .
at the same time , the german music industry has lost a quarter of its market , ” said mario ohoven , president of the federal association of small and medium-sized companies . the french government , which has a tradition of vehemently protecting its cultural players and institutions , has helped in other ways to increase domestic music sales .
french artists receive social security , unemployment benefits , and subsidies for touring and rehearsal spaces .
a 3.5 percent tax is levied on all concert box office sales and the revenue is used to support new artists , the export of music , and even the purchase of new equipment for artists . public wants it according to the german language association , which is an advocate for both more german on the radio and fewer english words in german , the public is ready to hear its own artists and its own language on the airwaves .
a poll that was conducted in april of this year found that 62 percent of those asked want more music with german lyrics . they aren ’ t alone .
across the world , the international federation of the phonographic industry points to the emergence of new sales patterns , with the sales of american artists beginning to decline across the world .
while 93 percent of sales in the u.s. market come from domestic artists , in 2001 , sales of local repertoires across the world grew to 67.5 percent .
this shift in buying patterns has caused other broadcasters to change their music strategies , even without quotas enforced from above .
mtv asia has begun shunning international acts to play up to 90 percent domestic music in each of the countries in which it broadcasts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de learning to be britney a new school in germany aims to put its students on the road to pop stardom .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder stands in front of a painting of the great wall as he waits for wu bangguo , chairman of the national people 's congress , in beijing , tuesday , dec .
2 , 2003 schroeder is on a five-day trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.12.2003 italy 's constitutional court considers immunity law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi may soon find his legal immunity reversed just weeks before italy gives up its rotating presidency of the eu , the country 's constitutional court is to rule on whether to overturn a law which ensures legal immunity for prime minister silvio berlusconi . earlier this year , the italian parliament approved legislation that made the prime minister immune from prosecution for as long as he remained in office .
if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .

if the court now rules that the law is unconstitutional , berlusconi could have a rocky time ahead of him until the general elections scheduled for 2006 .
the court 's decision in june immediately slammed the brakes on a corruption trial against berlusconi in milan , in which the prime minister faced accusations of trying to bribe judges in an attempt to further his business interests .
the politically charged trial revolved around the privatization in the 1980s of state-owned food company sme , which berlusconi 's business rival carlo de benedetti was attempting to acquire .
under the legislation , italy 's five senior public office holders - including the prime minister , the president , the speakers of both houses of parliament and the chief justice - were able to claim immunity from prosecution .
it was a highly inflammatory move .
the last few months have seen an anti-corruption campaign gather momentum that aims to force a referendum on the controversial immunity law .
activist and magistrate antonio di pietro collected almost one million signatures for a petition submitted to the supreme court .
however , if the court decides the law is unconstitutional , this would no longer be necessary .
tailored legislation it 's just one more challenge to silvio berlusconi 's beleagured leadership .
amid inflation and rising unemployment , his center-right coalition came under fire at the weekend as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to rome 's streets in union-backed protests at the government 's proposed pension reforms , which foresee italian citizens retiring only once they 've made 45 years of contributions , or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women .
berlusconi and his allies say the prime minister is the victim of a " witchhunt " initiated by left-wingers .
but the tycoon who presides over an empire based on broadcasting , publishing , banking and even soccer has long been accused of tailoring legislation to suit his interests .
italy 's richest man , berlusconi owns three mediaset channels , italia 1 , rete 4 and canale 5 , as well as political influence at the board of state public broadcaster rai .
a media bill approved in early december allows berlusconi to tighten his hold even further on italy 's media by reversing a court decision which would have forced the mediaset company to sell off one of its three television stations by the end of 2003 .
the bill also lifts the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increases the amount of advertising that one single company can have .
all these measures are likely to increase the profitability of mr berlusconi 's companies . a conflict of interest critics say the legislation is a blow to italy 's media freedom and plurality , and point out that berlusconi has influence over some 90 percent of italian media , which they argue leads inevitably to a conflict of interest .
if the court ruling deems the immunity law is not legal , berlusconi may well be sent back to court to answer to corruption charges .
surveys show that for the first time since becoming prime minister in 2001 , the businessman-turned-politician 's popularity is on the wane .
even if the court rules in his favor , the italian prime minister , who 's been a staunch ally of u.s. president george bush in recent months , may soon find his power curtailed when the voters next go to the polls .

the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .

days before an unofficial deadline to adopt a new eu constitution , german and french government officials on monday seemed pessimistic about reaching a compromise on crucial issues such as voting rights of member states . meeting with his eu colleagues in brussels to prepare friday ’ s decisive intergovernmental conference , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the document should not be adopted unless ongoing disagreements on its content can be resolved .
“ a bad constitution is not an option , ” fischer said . his french counterpart agreed .
“ we don ’ t want to nail this down at any price , ” said dominique de villepin , adding that rather than adopting pieces of the constitution , the adoption of the entire document should be postponed in case no compromise can be reached . voting rights crucial issue many issues still remain under discussion : eu foreign ministers on monday discussed the size and shape of the european commission , a mutual defense clause resisted by austria , finland , ireland and sweden and the powers of the european parliament and the commission on the eu budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's conference will decide whether this document becomes more than just a draft .
the voting rights of member states , however , have emerged as the most controversial issue .
the draft constitution would implement a so-called double majority on decisions , which means that a majority of eu countries as well as a majority of the european union ’ s total population of about 450 million would have to agree . countries such as spain and portugal would lose influence under the new regulation , since they want to keep voting rights in accordance with the 2000 nice treaty , giving them almost as much voting weight as germany despite populations of only half the size . poland suggests delaying decision in a last-minute attempt to salvage adoption of the constitution , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said his government was committed to finding a compromise .
“ poland will do everything , absolutely everything , to conclude our negotiations successfully in december , ” he said .
poland has suggested delaying a decision on the double majority until 2007 or 2008 , according to wire reports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schröder do n't plan to give in on eu voting rights .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has already said his government won ’ t go along with such a delay .
“ this is a point on which we are not prepared to move , ” schröder said after meeting with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in berlin on sunday . schröder will meet polish president aleksander kwasniewski in the german capital on thursday for final talks before friday ’ s conference . franco-german summit to synchronize positions on tuesday , the chancellor will head west for a summit with french president jacques chirac in paris .
both leaders have said in the past that they will not let hesitant eu member states delay the european unification process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution has 55 percent survival chances italian premier silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " 55 percent optimistic " european leaders would agree on the eu draft constitution this week .

days before an unofficial deadline to adopt a new eu constitution , german and french government officials on monday seemed pessimistic about reaching a compromise on crucial issues such as voting rights of member states . meeting with his eu colleagues in brussels to prepare friday ’ s decisive intergovernmental conference , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the document should not be adopted unless ongoing disagreements on its content can be resolved .
“ a bad constitution is not an option , ” fischer said . his french counterpart agreed .
“ we don ’ t want to nail this down at any price , ” said dominique de villepin , adding that rather than adopting pieces of the constitution , the adoption of the entire document should be postponed in case no compromise can be reached . voting rights crucial issue many issues still remain under discussion : eu foreign ministers on monday discussed the size and shape of the european commission , a mutual defense clause resisted by austria , finland , ireland and sweden and the powers of the european parliament and the commission on the eu budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's conference will decide whether this document becomes more than just a draft .

“ poland will do everything , absolutely everything , to conclude our negotiations successfully in december , ” he said .

days before an unofficial deadline to adopt a new eu constitution , german and french government officials on monday seemed pessimistic about reaching a compromise on crucial issues such as voting rights of member states . meeting with his eu colleagues in brussels to prepare friday ’ s decisive intergovernmental conference , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the document should not be adopted unless ongoing disagreements on its content can be resolved .
“ a bad constitution is not an option , ” fischer said . his french counterpart agreed .
“ we don ’ t want to nail this down at any price , ” said dominique de villepin , adding that rather than adopting pieces of the constitution , the adoption of the entire document should be postponed in case no compromise can be reached . voting rights crucial issue many issues still remain under discussion : eu foreign ministers on monday discussed the size and shape of the european commission , a mutual defense clause resisted by austria , finland , ireland and sweden and the powers of the european parliament and the commission on the eu budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friday 's conference will decide whether this document becomes more than just a draft .
the voting rights of member states , however , have emerged as the most controversial issue .
the draft constitution would implement a so-called double majority on decisions , which means that a majority of eu countries as well as a majority of the european union ’ s total population of about 450 million would have to agree . countries such as spain and portugal would lose influence under the new regulation , since they want to keep voting rights in accordance with the 2000 nice treaty , giving them almost as much voting weight as germany despite populations of only half the size . poland suggests delaying decision in a last-minute attempt to salvage adoption of the constitution , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said his government was committed to finding a compromise .

the airline said the move would help it to introduce a ‘ net pricing system ’ and bring in more transparency as travel agencies will be able to provide customers with a separate bill for their services .
german travel agencies , however , fear the measure will lead to a hike of 5-9 percent in the price of airline tickets .
president of the german association of travel agencies -lrb- drv -rrb- , klaus laaepple , told news agency dpa on tuesday that lufthansa had gone ahead with the move without consulting the travel industry .
he also criticized that the new pricing model would mean that each travel agency would have to calculate its own commissions and the customer would need to go to more than one travel agency to compare prices .

the airline said the move would help it to introduce a ‘ net pricing system ’ and bring in more transparency as travel agencies will be able to provide customers with a separate bill for their services .
german travel agencies , however , fear the measure will lead to a hike of 5-9 percent in the price of airline tickets .
president of the german association of travel agencies -lrb- drv -rrb- , klaus laaepple , told news agency dpa on tuesday that lufthansa had gone ahead with the move without consulting the travel industry .
he also criticized that the new pricing model would mean that each travel agency would have to calculate its own commissions and the customer would need to go to more than one travel agency to compare prices .
" lufthansa has disqualified itself as a reliable partner , " laepple said . more briefs 09.12.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler ceo testifies in fraud trial 08.12.2003 -pipe- economists forecast accelerated growth 08.12.2003 -pipe- germany to set up private financial regulator 06.12.2003 -pipe- siemens involved in nuclear row 05.12.2003 -pipe- nokia loses grip on western europe 05.12.2003 -pipe- delayed hope for construction industry 05.12.2003 -pipe- software ag seeks solutions in india 05.12.2003 -pipe- bayer opens new chemical factory radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the case is brought by u.s. billionaire investor kirk kerkorian against the carmaker and its executives over the nature of the merger between germany company daimler-benz and the u.s. company chrysler .
the 86-year-old billionaire , who owned 13.7 percent of chrysler corp. shares before its $ 36 billion tie-up with daimler-benz , accuses daimlerchrysler and schrempp of fraud and says a so-called " merger of equals " was actually a secret takeover by the german carmaker .
kerkorian filed the suit after schrempp told british daily financial times in 2000 that the deal was presented as a " merger of equals " for " psychological reasons " .
he is claiming $ 1.2 billion in damages .
daimlerchrysler has denied any wrongdoing and has not ruled out a settlement .
the trial will go on till dec .

shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .
new elections are likely in february . hamburg mayor ole von beust , a christian democrat , said on tuesday he could no longer rely on a majority in the city-state 's parliament .

he added that continued infighting among party members of the coalition ’ s junior partner threatened the city ’ s image . “ i can ’ t accept that the city ’ s reputation and dignity are being questioned , ” beust said . party seeks to expel founder at the center of the fall-out stands ronald schill , who is the founder of the populist right-wing schill party and served as hamburg ’ s interior minister until last august .
beust had dismissed the former judge after he allegedly threatened to disclose the mayor 's homosexuality over a personnel dispute . schill disappeared from the headlines for several months , but reemerged recently when the hamburg chapter of his party reelected him as its leader .
the national leadership deposed schill over the weekend , prompting that man once known as “ judge merciless ” to chair a party meeting at the same time as a another meeting endorsed by the party ’ s national leadership took place . as a result , schill threatened to depose national party leader mario mettbach , who also serves as hamburg ’ s deputy mayor .
mettbach in turn announced on tuesday that the party leadership would start proceedings to revoke schill ’ s party membership . “ we regret this , but i ’ m happy this farce is over , ” mettbach said after he , beust and a representative of the free liberal democrats , the third coalition partner , announced the government ’ s break-up . little change expected nationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust now faces an early re-election campaign .
though beust said he was relaxed about the idea of entering a reelection campaign , opinion polls suggest social democrats could regain power with the help of the green party .
in 2001 , schill ’ s unexpected success with voters had put christian democrats into office after more than 40 years of social democratic rule in the city . after losing several state elections , a hamburg victory would boost morale among social democrats and greens .
but they would not regain power in germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , because hamburg only has three votes in the 69-member body .
the conservative states control 41 seats and are therefore able to block government proposals such as current plans to lower taxes and revamp germany ’ s labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no more mercy for hamburg 's ' judge merciless ' hamburg 's controversial interior minister has lost his job .
mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .
erich klemm , the council ’ s president , said that key accusations against daimler have been cleared away . he added , however , that “ mercedes benz did not show a special sensitivity to human rights during the period . ” german journalist gaby weber ’ s lengthy investigation into the company ’ s past and the testimony of living witnesses were the driving forces pressuring daimlerchrysler into commissioning the report in 2002 .
the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .
“ that way it would admit its guilt .
it ’ s about wanting to shrug off any responsibility . ” rough road ahead for daimler daimlerchrylser didn ’ t escape completely unscathed .
tomuschat , who served on the u.n. human rights committee and spent two months in argentina investigating the accusations , criticized the firing of 117 employees without explanation after a three-week long strike during the military junta ’ s rule and the company ’ s relationship to the security authorities . the revelations will most likely serve as fodder for the lawsuit against daimlerchrysler currently being prepared in the united states on behalf of the survivors of those kidnapped . lawyers expect to bring it to court early next year . steffen leidel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit .

a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .
former employees are not satisfied . for the past year , berlin human rights professor christian tomuschat has pored over the activities of daimler benz during one of the worst periods of argentine history , looking for any wrongdoing . the car company wanted to clear its name of accusations that its argentine management had helped the military junta which help power in the country from 1976 to 1983 break down resistance from unions .
the company could breathe a collective sigh of relief this week after tomuschat largely cleared daimlerchrylser of any wrongdoing . “ we couldn ’ t find anything that threw a bad light on daimler , ” tomuschat told a press conference upon presenting the report monday . daimler ’ s employee council , who together with the association of critical shareholders pushed for the investigation , was also largely pleased with a results .

the committee focused largely on the activities of daimler ’ s production chief at the time , juan tasselkraut . daimler " shrugs off " responsibility former employee héctor ratto , who was kidnapped and tortured by the military junta , claimed tasselkraut identified union leaders to the military government .
at least ten employees were kidnapped by the government in 1976 and disappeared . tomuschat ’ s report cleared tasselkraut of any wrongdoing and said ratto ’ s story did not hold up to closer analysis .
prosecutors in nuremberg last week called off an investigation after which they planned to charge tasselkraut with murder and accessory to murder in the deaths of two former employees . there is no evidence daimler pursued anti-union policies , according to the report . “ it ’ s obvious that the company doesn ’ t want to reveal its past activities , ” ratto told dw-world .

although discussions are ongoing , diplomatic sources told the euobserver that members are agreed on the need to send a " positive signal to tehran . "
the move comes after november 's announcement from the iranian authorities to sign up to tougher inspections of its nuclear facilities after months of negotiation .
despite that breakthrough , eu member states are expected to stop short of calling for the resumption of formal , political economic and trade talks , which were earlier suspended because of fears over iran ’ s nuclear capabilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.12.2003 eu turns blind eye to berlin-beijing nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready to head to china ? - the plutonium plant in hanu , near frankfurt .
schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- france has already called for a lifting of the arms embargo , a view that was echoed by german chancellor schröder this month as well as eu trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the bloc was prepared to review its ban on arm sales to china .
eu states ’ make nuclear deals with beijing the issue of the eu arms embargo is also linked to brussels ’ efforts to hammer out an agreement over the cooperation of nuclear power projects with china .
at the october china-eu summit , the two sides said they hoped negotiations between beijing and the european atomic energy community -lrb- euratom -rrb- on cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear safety would soon make progress and lead to the framing of a treaty .
but even in the absence of a formal treaty , european countries , in particular france , have been increasingly cooperating with the chinese over nuclear projects .
the french are already involved in the construction of several nuclear reactors in china and have signed agreements with beijing covering nuclear engineering , production , reactor fuel and experimental reactors .
lifting of arms embargo too " premature " considering the exchange of nuclear technology and know-how between the eu and china , brussels is expected to turn a blind eye to schröder ’ s plans to sell a plutonium plant to beijing .
technically , the eu is also believed to have its hands tied in the case because the export of nuclear reactors to china that are meant for civilian use is still allowed in the eu .
only those that are meant to serve military needs are banned under the arms sanctions .
but whether the eu arms embargo on china will actually be lifted is still unclear .
france is using all its diplomatic channels to convince the rest of europe that easing arms restrictions against beijing is a good idea .
although supported by heavyweights germany , italy and britain , paris still faces strong opposition from denmark and sweden .
the european commission – the eu ’ s executive arm – said this month that talk of lifting the embargo was premature .
" there has been a feeling that the chinese would need to demonstrate very clearly the progress made in human rights before a lifting of the arms embargo can be considered , " emma udwin , a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner chris patten , told reporters .

schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing . german chancellor gerhard schröder is facing tough questioning at home over his recent trip to china .
on monday , protest was growing among the greens , the chancellor ’ s junior coalition partner , over schröder ’ s controversial calls in beijing for the ending of an eu arms embargo and his support for beijing ’ s " one china " policy .
many green party members believe that china ’ s human rights violations and its reputation as the world ’ s biggest buyer of foreign arms do not justify the chancellor ’ s lenient stance .
" that the chancellor is n't in a coalition with himself , but with the greens , that needs to come out at some point , " party leader reinhardt bütikofer told the german tv channel zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder the chancellor ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- green allies are also irked over his promise to the chinese government to sell beijing a plutonium processing plant near frankfurt for an estimated € 50 million .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , critics say it would be hypocritical of germany to sell nuclear equipment abroad while phasing out nuclear power at home .
the row now threatens to split the ruling coalition , as reports abound about a fallout between the chancellor and his popular green foreign minister , joschka fischer , as well as rising criticism among schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks .
brussels silent over schröder ’ s decision but even as the controversy gathers pace in germany , criticism remains muted in brussels .
the pointed silence of the eu isn ’ t without reason : the chancellor ’ s recent overtures to beijing are considered to be routine policy within the eu .
the eu froze relations with beijing in 1989 in the wake of the bloody suppression of student revolts by the communist party at the tiananmen square and imposed a number of economic and arms sanctions .
but eu-china relations showed signs of thaw a few years later , though arms sanctions remain in place .
in 1994 , beijing and brussels resumed bilateral political dialogue by agreeing to regular high-level ministerial meetings and drafted a strategy paper pinpointing areas of trade cooperation .
trade concerns dominate eu-china relations since then trade has remained the defining factor in the growing relationship between china and the european union .
china is now the eu ’ s third-largest non-european trading partner after the u.s. with bilateral trade amounting to € 115 million in 2002 .
the eu is china ’ s second-largest export market and european companies have invested heavily in china .
in recent years , brussels and beijing have also cooperated in areas such as industrial policy and science and technology .
at the recent eu-china summit in october , the two sides signed a € 200 million deal for beijing to take a stake in europe ’ s galileo satellite navigation system as well as agreements that will pave the way for chinese tour groups to visit eu states and establish closer ties between the two nations ’ car industries .
eu easing stance over china arms embargo ?
however the issue of the eu ’ s arms embargo remains the main sticking point between brussels and beijing .
china has repeatedly pushed for the lifting of the eu embargo , a request that the bloc has turned down until now .
however brussels is reported to have softened its stance over the 1989 arms sanctions recently .
at the bilateral summit in beijing in october this year , eu commission president romano prodi said that despite resistance in certain eu countries , brussels was working towards easing arms restrictions .

he also announced plans to monitor procurement and armament technologies within the german army , or bundeswehr , stressing that it was crucial to maintain the operational readiness of germany 's armed forces .

last year , researchers announced that women who took hrt faced a higher risk of illnesses such as breast cancer and heart attacks .
one of the two wyeth singapore plants produces only hrt drugs .
although capable of producing 1 billion pills a year , the plant is currently making just 120 million .
shutting down the singapore plant , which serves the asian and latin american markets , will be closed down in stages .
by june 2004 , the factory should be completely closed , with the loss of 200 jobs .
wyeth 's second plant in singapore , which produces nutritional supplements , will be unaffected by the shake-up .
research into the hazards of hrt is not yet seen as conclusive , and many still argue that the treatment can provide significant health benefits .
but concerns over the therapy has so far persuaded almost three-fifths of women to stop taking hrt , according to surveys .

researchers from energywatch called all the major suppliers asking how they could protect an elderly aunt who had previously been mis-sold energy .
the call centre staff told ' mystery shoppers ' the only way to make sure their aunt was not conned again was to make sure she did not answer the door to energy salespeople .
david sidebottom , regional director of energywatch north west , said the advice given " defies belief . "
the survey was intended to test industry commitment to a marketing code of practice , which is meant to give protection to customers so they are not sold power incorrectly .
' inadequate advice ' but 85 % of call centre staff had never heard of the code , and 34 % could not name any of the basic rules protecting people from mis-selling .
energywatch fear people could be missing out on an automatic £ 250 compensation payout if their signatures are forged .
only 0.3 % of call centre staff told callers that they qualified for compensation under the code of practice guidelines .
" i am shocked to find that frontline staff , who should be fully aware of the code and the seriousness of mis-selling , are not able to advise customers adequately , " mr sidebottom added .
mr sidebottom said one of the helpline staff who was aware of the code told an energywatch caller : " there is a code but no-one takes any notice of it .

last month , jim wallace said university bosses needed to come up with more creative funding ideas rather than just demand more cash from the state .
the issue of funding has become a contentious one since the westminster government promised to introduce top-up tuition fees in england .
it is not yet clear what impact that would have on scottish universities .
however , higher education institutions fear the worst north of the border .
in the context of the uk funding debate , scottish university principals will tell mr wallace why they think they need an extra £ 100m .
the minister for enterprise and lifelong learning has not ruled out providing more cash , but he disappointed some university chiefs last month when he warned that there would be no blank cheques .
tuesday 's informal discussions are an opportunity for both sides to voice their concerns .
last month , professor bill stevely , convener of universities of scotland , warned the scottish executive against trying to run universities " on the cheap " .
he said scotland currently suffered from a funding gap with comparable european competitor nations of £ 169m , although scottish universities were seeking only a further £ 100m from the executive .
but mr wallace said he was not confident that large additional injections of government money into the system would provide a long-term solution to the future funding challenges .

over 97 % of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme , which has now cleared its final hurdle .
amp shocked the market in may when it unveiled plans to split into two firms , fencing off its british unit , hhg .
hhg , which comprises insurers pearl , npi and london life , a fund manager , and a financial-planning firm , has been hit by weak stock markets .
the firm is officially valued by amp at £ 1.3bn , but analysts have speculated that its shares may trade much lower than expected when they are listed .
fresh start hhg is due to be listed on the london stock exchange later this month , with a reborn amp listed simultaneously in sydney .
amp chairman peter willcox admitted that there was the potential for " hhg to be undervalued by the market in its early days " .
this , in turn , will force amp into a bigger-than-expected write down of its uk holdings , the latest in a series of blows from its disastrous investments in britain .
in australia , meanwhile , the company has been the subject of persistent rumours of a takeover , probably by national australia bank -lrb- nab -rrb- .

plans to introduce two new offences of " aggravated vehicle taking " and " causing death by aggravated vehicle taking " were published on tuesday .
the proposals were developed following a review of road traffic penalties set up earlier this year .
criminal justice minister john spellar said the legislation was targeted specifically towards northern ireland .
" this destructive crime harms the entire community and inflicts untold suffering on those who have lost loved ones because of it , " he said .
car crime proposals aggravated vehicle taking : maximum five year sentence death or grievous bodily injury by aggravated vehicle taking : maximum 14 years dangerous driving : maximum sentence increase from two to five years " it has no place in a civilised community .
" this has an appalling effect on families and on communities ... the loss of a loved one - especially someone so young - is devastating .
" how often when you hear of these cases you find out that the driver is unlicensed , uninsured and sometimes even disqualified as well . "
he added : " they -lrb- the community -rrb- want and we want those people to go away for a long time and to be out of society for a long time . "
' death drivers ' tougher sentences for causing death by dangerous driving and careless driving are to be introduced in the new year .
the maximum penalty for these offences will be increased from 10 to 14 years through the criminal justice act 2003 .
kieran conlon of the group families bereaved through car crime said those who killed someone while driving a car had to be given stiffer sentences .
" my son , who was 21 , was knocked down and killed by death drivers just over a year and a half ago , " he said .
" they did n't stop - they did n't hit the brakes .
they drove on and burnt the car out .
chief inspector peter farrar said runarounds posed a great difficulty " the person who killed my son got four years , which means he will be out in two .
he will be out on my son 's anniversary - i think my son was worth a bit more than that . "
west belfast mother mary mccombe , whose 15-year-old daughter debbie was killed by the driver of a stolen car in march 2002 , said it was a positive move .
" if they give them a stiffer sentence certainly it is going to deter anyone from going out and stealing a car and driving it , " she said .
" it is the only way i think it is going to work .
if they get two or three years and then it is cut in half - that is nothing to them . "
however , dominic hyland from the colin safer neighbourhood project in west belfast said the changes did not go far enough .
debbie mccomb , 15 , was killed on the springfield road in belfast " in my eyes , killing anyone - whether with a car or anything else - is murder , " he said .
" i personally think it should carry a sentence which qualified for murder . "
as part of the package , the police are also being given extra powers to deal with so-called " runaround " cars .
chief inspector peter farrar said these posed a great difficulty for police .
" these are vehicles which may have only cost £ 50 to £ 100 and nobody ever licensed or had any insurance for .
" it does n't matter if the car is stolen or whether you own it - we will have a power of arrest there and then to take that person off the street . "

the need to relieve traffic congestion around the m6 in the uk 's industrial heartland was first identified by the conservatives as far back as 1980 .
but it was 1990 before the government invited private firms to bid for the contract to build the route , the year it was confirmed the development would be a private toll road .
two public inquiries and a series of protests against the proposed route helped to push back the start of building work until 2001 , 10 years after midland expressway ltd -lrb- mel -rrb- was appointed to run the project .
campaigners have raised financial , environmental and practical objections to the route , which was known as the birmingham northern relief road -lrb- bnnr -rrb- until it was renamed as the m6 toll in 2001 .
a timeline of the m6 toll 1980 - government proposes a new midlands motorway 1986 - preferred route announced 1988 - first public inquiry 1991 - mel announced as the bid winner to build the road 1994-5 - second public inquiry 1999 - alliance against the bnnr 's challenge defeated 2001 - main construction work begins 2003 - m6 toll opens the first public inquiry into the scheme was held in 1988 and was followed by another which lasted more than a year , from june 1994 to october 1995 .
an informal coalition opposing the project , initially set up by west midlands friends of the earth , evolved into the alliance against the bnrr .
it brought together more than 30 organisations , including environmental groups , and residents who lived in villages and communities along the length of the route .
groups opposed to the bnrr had hoped labour 's defeat of the conservatives in 1997 would signal the end of the controversial project .
but the courts upheld the new government 's decision to build the road , in what protestors claimed was a revision of its position before the election .
a number of protest camps were set up along the route between november 1997 and january 1999 , when the last one was cleared .
many of the objections to the project were on environmental grounds .
the road is the uk 's only toll motorway the road runs through four sites of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- and protestors say the work to build it has severely damaged one of them , chasewater heath .
mel said it spent several months examining the impact of the project on all kinds of wildlife .
the firm had to apply for compulsory purchase orders for properties along some of the route , although it said only 40 buildings needed to be demolished and about six businesses closed during the road 's construction .
the company also brought in specialists to carry out archaeological digs at several points along the 27-mile route between 2000 and spring 2001 , when construction work was finally able to begin .
mel claims the m6 toll will save motorists approximately 45 minutes on an average journey time by avoiding the heavily-congested section of the m6 north of birmingham .

but it was 1990 before the government invited private firms to bid for the contract to build the route , the year it was confirmed the development would be a private toll road .
two public inquiries and a series of protests against the proposed route helped to push back the start of building work until 2001 , 10 years after midland expressway ltd -lrb- mel -rrb- was appointed to run the project .
campaigners have raised financial , environmental and practical objections to the route , which was known as the birmingham northern relief road -lrb- bnnr -rrb- until it was renamed as the m6 toll in 2001 .
a timeline of the m6 toll 1980 - government proposes a new midlands motorway 1986 - preferred route announced 1988 - first public inquiry 1991 - mel announced as the bid winner to build the road 1994-5 - second public inquiry 1999 - alliance against the bnnr 's challenge defeated 2001 - main construction work begins 2003 - m6 toll opens the first public inquiry into the scheme was held in 1988 and was followed by another which lasted more than a year , from june 1994 to october 1995 .
an informal coalition opposing the project , initially set up by west midlands friends of the earth , evolved into the alliance against the bnrr .
it brought together more than 30 organisations , including environmental groups , and residents who lived in villages and communities along the length of the route .
groups opposed to the bnrr had hoped labour 's defeat of the conservatives in 1997 would signal the end of the controversial project .
but the courts upheld the new government 's decision to build the road , in what protestors claimed was a revision of its position before the election .
a number of protest camps were set up along the route between november 1997 and january 1999 , when the last one was cleared .
many of the objections to the project were on environmental grounds .
the road is the uk 's only toll motorway the road runs through four sites of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- and protestors say the work to build it has severely damaged one of them , chasewater heath .
mel said it spent several months examining the impact of the project on all kinds of wildlife .
the firm had to apply for compulsory purchase orders for properties along some of the route , although it said only 40 buildings needed to be demolished and about six businesses closed during the road 's construction .
the company also brought in specialists to carry out archaeological digs at several points along the 27-mile route between 2000 and spring 2001 , when construction work was finally able to begin .
mel claims the m6 toll will save motorists approximately 45 minutes on an average journey time by avoiding the heavily-congested section of the m6 north of birmingham .

the need to register every year was brought in by the electoral fraud act 2002 .

the commission says less than half of them showed up , suggesting that they were put off by the hearings ' " semi-judicial nature " .
the head of the electoral commission , seamus magee , said more than 70 % of people surveyed felt the new measures had instilled greater confidence in the democratic process .
" on the other hand , there are some negatives .
one of those is that the individual registration has tended to make it more difficult for young people in particular and for people with disabilities to register , " he said .
" the challenge that we have is to address those particular issues - to ensure the registration rate , which is currently around 88 % , is up as close into the 90s as we can . "
