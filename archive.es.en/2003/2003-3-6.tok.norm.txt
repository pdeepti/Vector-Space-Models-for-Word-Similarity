it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .

-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .
duisenberg acknowledged this fact on thursday and appeared to leave open the possibility of further moves .

the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .
duisenberg acknowledged this fact on thursday and appeared to leave open the possibility of further moves .
" any judgment on future developments is overshadowed at present by the geopolitical tensions and their potential resolution , " he said , adding that the ecb " stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .

-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .

with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .

but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .

-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .

the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .

schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .
februar 2003 .
schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .
februar 2003 .
schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .
duisenberg acknowledged this fact on thursday and appeared to leave open the possibility of further moves .
" any judgment on future developments is overshadowed at present by the geopolitical tensions and their potential resolution , " he said , adding that the ecb " stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner .

rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .

schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .
februar 2003 .
schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .
the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions .
-lrb- march 4 , 2003 -rrb- germany 's jobless and the self-help solution germany 's jobless are turning to less traditional approaches in their search for work and as a result , self-help books promising fast-tracks to dream jobs are flying off the shelves .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .

at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .
februar 2003 .
schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .

-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .

the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .

with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .
februar 2003 .
schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .
the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions .
-lrb- march 4 , 2003 -rrb- germany 's jobless and the self-help solution germany 's jobless are turning to less traditional approaches in their search for work and as a result , self-help books promising fast-tracks to dream jobs are flying off the shelves .

the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .

at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .
duisenberg acknowledged this fact on thursday and appeared to leave open the possibility of further moves .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .
februar 2003 .
schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .
the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .
februar 2003 .
schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .

-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .

it is the third-worst total in the country 's history . the unemployment numbers that florian gerster presented to the german public on thursday looked bleak .
but the head of german labor office said he had not lost all hope .
under certain circumstances , the social democrat said , the prospects for improvement could rise in the second half of the year .
" that is based on a mixture of hope and probability , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster gerster -lrb- photo -rrb- gave his analysis at the monthly news conference he holds in nuremberg to announce the country 's latest unemployment figures .
the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
but the rise was much smaller than january 's increase , when 398,000 people lost their jobs and the unemployment rate rose 1 percentage point to 11.1 percent .
the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .
this was the case last month as well , when a total of 83,100 more people became unemployed .
with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .

the numbers he presented on thursday were not pleasant news for the country 's political leadership : the february unemployment rate hit its third highest monthly level in the country 's history .
rate rises to 11.3 percent the rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february .
in human terms , 4.706 million people were out of work during the month .
that figure is roughly 300,000 more than the total population of the country 's sixth-biggest state , saxony .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .

the total number of people who became unemployed in february was calculated in two different ways - one that includes seasonal factors like weather and one that does not .
because of winter weather , the february rate usually climbs .

with things like weather removed from the calculation , the total was 67,000 , nearly twice the number expected by economists interviewed by the reuters news agency .
cold winter blamed for increase gerster blamed the weather for the overall increase .
" february was cold and snowy .
that drove up the total number of unemployed workers who work outside , " gerster said .
the average temperature for the month was 0.4 degree -lrb- 32 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
that was 2 to 3 degrees lower than average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gestikuliert waehrend seiner regierungserklaerung zum irak-konflikt im bundestag in berlin am donnerstag , 13 .

schroeder lehnte erneut eine deutsche beteiligung an einem militaerschlag gegen irak ab .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german chancellor gerhard schroeder gestures during his governing declaration about a possible military strike on iraq at a german bundestag parliament session in berlin on thursday , feb .
13 , 2003 .
schroeder told the german parliament thursday his commitment to a peaceful solution of the iraq crisis remains undiminished , insisting that a war can still be headed off .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- the high unemployment rate is the most pressing domestic political problem facing chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who once promised voters that he would drive down the total to 3.5 million .
since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .
the eu country with the highest total was spain with 12.1 percent and the country with the lowest was luxembourg with 2.7 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor fails to bring unions and employers together gerhard schröder has failed to budge the country 's unions and employers ' groups over the issue of job creation .

since taking office in october 1998 , he has sought to seek a consensus program on job creation with the country 's business and worker representatives in a forum called alliance for jobs .
but the effort broke down for good on monday , and the chancellor is now working on his own program that he will detail in an address to the country 's parliament next thursday .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said on monday .
schröder 's economics and labor minister spread a similar message after hearing the latest jobless figures .
" given the overall serious situation on the job market , everyone must recognize that the time for discussing economic and employment issues is over , " wolfgang clement said .
" now is the time for action . "
economy barely grew last year the climbing jobless rate has spread a stain like spilled ink on the country 's stagnate economy .
last year , that economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since germany suffered through a recession in 1993 .
at the same time , the jobless problem has darkened consumer confidence , sending it down to 1993 levels as well .
" as long as the german economy remains stagnate , the job market can not improve , " gerster said .
but even if the economy were to grow by 1 percent this year , as clement is predicting , the number of unemployed people in the country would still total about 4.23 million , according to the institute for employment research .
that would be 170,000 more than the average total in 2002 , said the institute , which is associated with gerster 's agency .
leading economists like hans-werner sinn also say growth will not produce a flourishing job market .
" in 1970 , we had only 150,000 jobless workers , " sinn said in a recent interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" this year , we are expecting 4.3 million .
the trend has not been stopped .
we are on the wrong track . "
these economists say the government needs to get at issues that they consider to be the real source of the problem .
these issues include the high non-labor costs created by climbing premiums for health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system and the country 's regulations on layoffs .
unions resist regulations change such issues have been discussed in schröder 's alliance for jobs .
but the chancellor has encountered stiff resistance from the country 's union leadership , particularly on the issue of layoffs .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , said recently .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
germany is not the only european country that is watching its unemployment rate grow .
the rate is climbing throughout the european union , according to a report released this week by eurostat , the union 's statistical agency .
in january , more than 3.9 million people lost their jobs in the 15-member alliance .
the overall rate rose from 7.8 percent to 7.9 percent .
the rate is calculated in a different way from germany 's method , and germany is planning to introduce the eu system in order to achieve uniformity .
the union 's statisticians count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
based on the eu calculation , germany had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in january .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

they agreed to adopt a “ good practice guide ” that would offer advice to leagues eager to root out racist activity in their fan clubs .
possible options include refusing licenses to teams that don ’ t do enough to combat racism in their stadiums , said kurt wachter , of the european anti-racism organization fare . " i think it was an abolute success , " wachter told dw-world .
" i think ... the discussion process gave you the feeling that you were at the start of something . " conference participants could also draw on the experience of england , among the most progressive soccer countries in dealing with the problem . “ we can certainly learn a lot from england , ” gerd dombowski , co-author of “ crime scene : stadium , ” a book documenting fan violence and racism in german soccer .
“ the english media are more sensitized to the problem , as are the teams . ” soccer stadiums : nazi meeting point that sensitivity is lacking in germany , said dombowski , where many soccer teams have active neo-nazi fan blocs who use game time to build contacts and recruit new members .
those same fans shower foreign players with chanted racist slurs and songs , and display neo-nazi symbols on banners and posters . “ in eastern germany , -lrb- the nazi element -rrb- is more open , ” dombowski said in an interview with dw-world .
“ in the west , it has gotten more subtle , more hidden .
they use codes and new symbols instead of the swastika . ” replacing the jungle calls that once greeted players from the african continent are numbers like “ 88 . ”
the number 8 being the numerical equivalent of the letter ” h , " and " 88 " being skinhead code for " heil hitler . " some teams , like the hanover 96 club , have taken action against the codes and symbols , banning them from their stadiums .
teams in four german leagues , including the top flight bundesliga , have also adopted a 10 point anti-racist plan fashioned by the german soccer association . with teams lagging , fans take action dombowski said the first step that many teams should take is to acknowledge that they have radical fan blocs .
but he said it was a step that many were still unwilling to take . “ i have a drawer full of resolutions -lrb- by teams -rrb- , and not many have been implemented , ” said dombowski , who is active in baff , the germany-wide organization against racism in soccer . the initiative is often left up to fans frustrated by the tasteless songs and catcalls of others in the stadium .
johannes stender started fck fans against racism for his hometown club fc kaiserslautern after hearing fans ridicule opposing players as “ gypsies . ”
" it wasn ’ t an option for me to stop going to the games , ” said stender , who has been going to games for 22 years .
“ so i decided to take a stand against racism . ” using his web site , he brings like-minded fans together and posts reports from fans who witness racist behavior .
visitors are invited to sign a petition against racism . such grassroots initiatives need more encouragement and support from clubs , said dombowski .
with germany set to hold the world cup in 2006 , everyone from europe ’ s top soccer officials to people like stender need to cooperate more to avoid an international embarassment . ” we can ’ t ban racism from soccer because it ’ s a problem of society , ” said dombowski .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .
" the outlook for price stability over the middle term has improved over the past months , particularly because of restrained growth and the latest currency developments , " he said .
inflation in the 12 countries that use the euro currency remains above the bank 's 2 percent target .
but core inflation - which excludes more volatile food and energy prices - has been slowing more quickly than anticipated .
euro gaining strength meanwhile , the euro has been climbing against the dollar .
the currency topped $ 1.10 for the first time in nearly four years wednesday amid concern that war in iraq could disrupt the u.s. economy .
it traded at $ 1.09 at midday thursday in europe .
at the same time , economies in europe have been sluggish , with growth in the economies of the eurozone countries ' not exceeding 0.8 percent last year .
the economies of all 15 european union members did not fare much better , rising 0.9 percent , comparing to rates of 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent in 2001 .
moreover , the outlook for the first part of 2003 is gloomy : the european commission envisions a possible drop in the eurozone during the first quarter and an increase of 0.2 percent in the second .
potential war causes uncertainty the rate cut is aimed at improving those results .
but the bankers have one issue hanging over their heads that they can not control - a possible u.s.-led war against iraq and the potential economic turbulence it could cause .
" the increasing tensions in the world turn every economic forecast into a fleeting snapshot , " the halle institute for economic research noted on thursday .
duisenberg acknowledged this fact on thursday and appeared to leave open the possibility of further moves .
" any judgment on future developments is overshadowed at present by the geopolitical tensions and their potential resolution , " he said , adding that the ecb " stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner .

the interest rate cut matches the lowest level ever . wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , made good on a pledge thursday .
at a meeting last month , duisenberg said the bank " would not hesitate to act " on interest rates if new signs of economic weakness emerged .
the bank 's 18-member governing council took just this step in frankfurt on thursday , cutting rates for the second time in three months in an effort to revive the world 's second largest economy .
three months ago , the banks ' leaders had cut rates from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent in their first rate decision in a year .
thursday 's decision followed that decrease , with a rate cut to 2.5 percent - the lowest level ever .
bankers worried about economy the decision aligns the european central bank with other central banks in europe which are growing increasingly concerned about sluggish economies across the continent .
the bank of england held its key interest rate steady at 3.75 percent thursday , one month after trimming it to its lowest level for 48 years , and norway 's central bank on wednesday also cut rates by half a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim duisenberg duisenberg said the bank cut the rates because the leaders saw no inflationary pressures building in the economy - inflation being the bankers ' top priority .

at the close of smith 's last novel , monsoon , the pair had finally reached the cape of good hope to start a new life in south africa .
blue horizon - published tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- - follows them as they travel along the infamous roberts ' road , to stake their claim in southern africa .
wilbur smith dropped in to the breakfast studio this morning .
he revealed how he met his new wife in a bookstore - when she was contemplating buying a book by a rival author .
and he also told us how he sits down on the same date - february 6 - every second year , to write his next book. click here to watch breakfast 's interview in full with wilbur smith farming family wilbur smith , who 's 70 this year , is one of the world 's most successful and prolific novelists .
all 28 of his books are still in print - and they 've been translated into 26 languages .
but smith 's choice of career was n't obvious from the start .
he was born into a white colonial farming family in northern rhodesia -lrb- now zambia -rrb- .
his father boasted that he 'd never read a book in his life : he preferred farming and hunting instead .
the young wilbur wanted to be a journalist , but his father disapproved .
so , he became a civil servant instead - and only took up writing when his first marriage collapsed .
blue horizon is published by macmillan in hardback at £ 18.99 .

justice minister jim wallace said the 430 staff at the maximum security jail in lanarkshire were being recognised for their " outstanding " work .
there were two disturbances at shotts within a week in january , which resulted in the minister promising to prioritise staff safety .
three officers were stabbed during trouble at the jail and one officer broke his leg during a 19-hour siege , involving 80 prisoners , a week earlier . "
to pick out individuals when there were so many heroes would be wrong " justice minister jim wallace addressing a reception at edinburgh castle on wednesday evening , the minister said staff had worked tremendously in difficult circumstances .
he said : " to pick out individuals when there were so many heroes would be wrong . "
mr wallace told guests that prisoners at the jail took part in " concerted indiscipline " at the jail in december and january .
" it was the skill , professionalism and bravery of scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- staff that brought it under control .
' good order ' " that it was not worse was down to the outstanding way the officers responded . "
mr wallace said £ 110m investment would help produce conditions for staff and prisoners " fit for the 21st century " .
he praised the work of staff education and rehabilitation programmes which aim to help inmates .
however , he said " custody and good order " must always be the main priority .
" i and my ministerial colleagues deplore violence by prisoners .
let 's not beat about the bush - the people many of you have to deal with , day in and day out are some of scotland 's most dangerous people .
" there can be no excuse whatsoever for violent behaviour towards prison officers who undertake their duty on our behalf . "
mr wallace held " constructive " talks with the head of the scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- to discuss january 's unrest which left the jail with a £ 1m repair bill .
the prison 's a hall , which sustained the worst damage , is not expected to be ready to re-house prisoners until late march .
the 115 inmates previously housed in a hall were transferred to five other jails .
mr wallace said that the refurbishment of shotts ' a-hall would include improved security arrangements .
he also suggested that officers should be issued with knife-proof vests similar to those worn by police .

justice minister jim wallace said the 430 staff at the maximum security jail in lanarkshire were being recognised for their " outstanding " work .
there were two disturbances at shotts within a week in january , which resulted in the minister promising to prioritise staff safety .
three officers were stabbed during trouble at the jail and one officer broke his leg during a 19-hour siege , involving 80 prisoners , a week earlier .
to pick out individuals when there were so many heroes would be wrong justice minister jim wallace addressing a reception at edinburgh castle on wednesday evening , the minister said staff had worked tremendously in difficult circumstances .
he said : " to pick out individuals when there were so many heroes would be wrong . "
mr wallace told guests that prisoners at the jail took part in " concerted indiscipline " at the jail in december and january .
" it was the skill , professionalism and bravery of scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- staff that brought it under control .
' good order ' " that it was not worse was down to the outstanding way the officers responded . "
mr wallace said £ 110m investment would help produce conditions for staff and prisoners " fit for the 21st century " .
he praised the work of staff education and rehabilitation programmes which aim to help inmates .
however , he said " custody and good order " must always be the main priority .
" i and my ministerial colleagues deplore violence by prisoners .
let 's not beat about the bush - the people many of you have to deal with , day in and day out are some of scotland 's most dangerous people .
inmates left the jail with a £ 1m repair bill " there can be no excuse whatsoever for violent behaviour towards prison officers who undertake their duty on our behalf . "
mr wallace held " constructive " talks with the head of the scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- to discuss january 's unrest which left the jail with a £ 1m repair bill .
the prison 's a hall , which sustained the worst damage , is not expected to be ready to re-house prisoners until late march .
the 115 inmates previously housed in a hall were transferred to five other jails .
mr wallace said that the refurbishment of shotts ' a-hall would include improved security arrangements .
he also suggested that officers should be issued with knife-proof vests similar to those worn by police .

it means that if a child is snatched anywhere in sussex , the police will be able to send a warning to the phone of everyone who has registered .
the project is the second phase of child rescue alert , set up by sussex police in november with the backing of the mother of murdered schoolgirl sarah payne .
over 4,000 phones in sussex have already been registered to receive the messages .
sara payne launched a newsflash scheme in november among them are all sussex police , east and west sussex county councils and brighton and hove city council mobiles .
sussex police worked with east grinstead-based company community alerts to set up a pioneering system combining text messaging with mapping technology .
it means officers will be able to target phones within a selected area , whether within 100 metres of the site of a suspected abduction or up to 100 km away .
neighbourhood watch co-ordinators will now hand out 300,000 leaflets across the county encouraging people to sign up to the scheme .
' act as extra eyes ' project manager detective chief inspector martyn underhill said : " we need to increase the number of people who can act as extra eyes and increase even further the chance of saving the child .
" people normally have their mobile phone with them and registering that phone to receive an alert is something positive that everyone can do to help . "
people can register their phones online at the child rescue alert website .
under the initial phase of the project , sussex police set up a system to send an alert to local radio and television stations as soon as a child is snatched .
they will then broadcast a newsflash giving details of the missing child to the public .
child rescue alert is based on an american system called amber alert .
