there is a deep-rooted belief in the technology world that we should be able to do a whole lot more while we are out and about , such as accessing our own information , connecting to the net and being entertained .
companies are pouring billions into the idea of being mobile .
possibly the best news is that getting a foot on the mobile ladder is easier than ever .
at a basic level handheld pdas are a bit like electronic diaries and address books , giving you access to all your core information .
they were once aimed at businessmen with deep pockets , but with that market not performing , pda makers have decided that they should focus their efforts on consumers instead .
" we 're seeing the market getting cheaper and cheaper , " said ian delaney of what handheld ? magazine .
" as we look round the show , a lot of asian manufacturers are offering very cheap pdas which offer the same functionality as the $ 500 devices we were buying last year . "

perhaps you will want to take a photo and e-mail it to your friends .
or listen to your favourite tunes whilst looking up your next appointment .
these days handheld devices pack enough processing power and memory to be of real use .
in this evolution of the pda , its core function - access to information - has not been overlooked , especially when it comes to connecting to the internet .
some of today 's models sport bluetooth which means you can connect your pda to the net wirelessly in conjunction with a suitable phone .
several high-end models even include built-in wi-fi , so you can surf the web or get your e-mails if you are within range of a wireless hotspot .
two into one what you will not generally find on pdas this year are voice capabilities .
the xda is a pda-phone hybrid the industry seems to have backed away from last year 's attempts to physically integrate phones into the devices .

i do n't think people like it , " said mr delaney .
" when people choose a phone they want something small and light , not something massive . "
this does not mean the all-in-one concept is dead - it is just been reborn .
instead of the pda with integrated phone , we have the smaller phone with integrated pda .
makers of cellphone handsets have jumped on the all-in-one bandwagon with gusto .
new so-called smart phones not only look more and more like small pdas , they also behave like them , with a host of similar functions including e-mail and internet access , cameras , gaming , audio and video players .
it is a lot to cram in , and traditional pda makers are yet to be convinced .

ministers will not block an application by pharmaceutical companies to make statins more widely available , a report in the sunday telegraph suggests .
statins which are used to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a heart attack are currently only available on prescription .
studies have also suggested they can protect against alzheimer 's disease and brittle bones .
cheaper drugs the patent on statins is due to run out next year which will allow other pharmaceutical companies to start producing these drugs .
statins are the most expensive item on the nhs drugs bill .
according to the report , ministers hope the decision to allow statins to be bought by patients without a prescription would see the cost of these drugs to the nhs fall dramatically .
one million prescriptions for statins are issued each month in the uk at an annual cost of £ 440m .
this is despite the fact the drugs are restricted to only those with a 30 % chance of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years .
the decision to allow the drug to be bought over the counter could also help save thousands of lives each year .
a study published last year , estimated as many as 10,000 lives could be saved each year in britain if statins were more widely available .
nevertheless , a decision to allow pharmacists to sell statins to patients without a prescription would also spark concern in some quarters .
statins have been linked to muscle ache and a reduced liver function .
in extreme cases the drug has been found to lead to muscle wasting and even total renal failure .
nevertheless , experts have backed the move .
professor chris packard , head of clinical biochemistry at glasgow royal infirmary , told the sunday telegraph : " this is a good option .
it is a good way forward for expanding the prevention of coronary heart disease . "
studies have shown patients who take statins within days of having a heart attack cut their risk of going on to have a stroke by half .
other studies have suggested statins can protect against alzheimer 's and even brittle bones .
in march , scientists suggested the drugs could also help to slow down the advance of multiple sclerosis .
