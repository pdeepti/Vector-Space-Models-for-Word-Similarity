six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giscard d 'estaing -lrb- right -rrb- gestures next to eu commissioner romano prodi during a press conference in athens in april .
according to eu commissioner romano prodi -lrb- right , with giscard -rrb- , giscard 's blueprint failed to capture the spirit of reform that was discussed at the latest eu summit in athens . the reform could lead to unequal treatment of member states , and would jeopardize trust between them , he said .
also , he said , the move would create rival bureaucracies and undermine accountability and effectiveness .
" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .
duplication of bureaucracies goes against common sense and against indications coming from all sides , " the eu executive said in a statement .
following closed-door debate on wednesday , the convention 's presidium eventually forced giscard to drop the idea of the vice presidency , and pushed off the idea of the smaller commission to the distant future .
' autistic ' proposal however , it held on to the idea of the permanent president of the european council , the bloc 's highest political body , who would prepare and chair eu summits .
it also upheld the idea of the foreign minister , to be appointed by eu leaders but with a seat on the commission , to conduct the bloc 's emerging common foreign and security policy .
speaking for the european parliament , senior christian democrat elmar brok condemned giscard 's proposals as " autistic . "

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .
echoing the line taken by the government , rürup and the commission ’ s other experts said there was little choice but to implement the painful reforms in order to preserve germany ’ s social security system . as to be expected , the spd left wing and trade unions immediately attacked the commission 's recommendations .

unless he is able to get the spd firmly behind his reforms , it is likely he will have to use the party congress in june as a quasi-confidence vote on his leadership . but first he will have to weather rough days ahead , especially as the unions and left-wing hardliners use next week ’ s traditional may day celebrations across the country to rally opposition to the reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd split widens on schröder reforms germany 's chancellor faced intensified criticism from spd left wing rebels over easter , as the threat of a vote of confidence in him moves ever closer .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .
echoing the line taken by the government , rürup and the commission ’ s other experts said there was little choice but to implement the painful reforms in order to preserve germany ’ s social security system . as to be expected , the spd left wing and trade unions immediately attacked the commission 's recommendations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula engelen-kefer " the rürup commission proposals on the future of state pensions are a cold rejection of social justice and sustainable reform , " said ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the german trade union federation . added to the anger over the proposed welfare cuts , a revolt over the pension proposals could present schröder with an unpalatable choice .
unless he is able to get the spd firmly behind his reforms , it is likely he will have to use the party congress in june as a quasi-confidence vote on his leadership . but first he will have to weather rough days ahead , especially as the unions and left-wing hardliners use next week ’ s traditional may day celebrations across the country to rally opposition to the reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd split widens on schröder reforms germany 's chancellor faced intensified criticism from spd left wing rebels over easter , as the threat of a vote of confidence in him moves ever closer .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .

also , he said , the move would create rival bureaucracies and undermine accountability and effectiveness .
" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .
duplication of bureaucracies goes against common sense and against indications coming from all sides , " the eu executive said in a statement .
following closed-door debate on wednesday , the convention 's presidium eventually forced giscard to drop the idea of the vice presidency , and pushed off the idea of the smaller commission to the distant future .

it also upheld the idea of the foreign minister , to be appointed by eu leaders but with a seat on the commission , to conduct the bloc 's emerging common foreign and security policy .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .
echoing the line taken by the government , rürup and the commission ’ s other experts said there was little choice but to implement the painful reforms in order to preserve germany ’ s social security system . as to be expected , the spd left wing and trade unions immediately attacked the commission 's recommendations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula engelen-kefer " the rürup commission proposals on the future of state pensions are a cold rejection of social justice and sustainable reform , " said ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the german trade union federation . added to the anger over the proposed welfare cuts , a revolt over the pension proposals could present schröder with an unpalatable choice .
unless he is able to get the spd firmly behind his reforms , it is likely he will have to use the party congress in june as a quasi-confidence vote on his leadership . but first he will have to weather rough days ahead , especially as the unions and left-wing hardliners use next week ’ s traditional may day celebrations across the country to rally opposition to the reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd split widens on schröder reforms germany 's chancellor faced intensified criticism from spd left wing rebels over easter , as the threat of a vote of confidence in him moves ever closer .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giscard d 'estaing -lrb- right -rrb- gestures next to eu commissioner romano prodi during a press conference in athens in april .
according to eu commissioner romano prodi -lrb- right , with giscard -rrb- , giscard 's blueprint failed to capture the spirit of reform that was discussed at the latest eu summit in athens . the reform could lead to unequal treatment of member states , and would jeopardize trust between them , he said .
also , he said , the move would create rival bureaucracies and undermine accountability and effectiveness .
" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .
duplication of bureaucracies goes against common sense and against indications coming from all sides , " the eu executive said in a statement .
following closed-door debate on wednesday , the convention 's presidium eventually forced giscard to drop the idea of the vice presidency , and pushed off the idea of the smaller commission to the distant future .
' autistic ' proposal however , it held on to the idea of the permanent president of the european council , the bloc 's highest political body , who would prepare and chair eu summits .
it also upheld the idea of the foreign minister , to be appointed by eu leaders but with a seat on the commission , to conduct the bloc 's emerging common foreign and security policy .
speaking for the european parliament , senior christian democrat elmar brok condemned giscard 's proposals as " autistic . "
" this is purely about reducing the powers of smaller eu countries , the commission and the european parliament , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .
echoing the line taken by the government , rürup and the commission ’ s other experts said there was little choice but to implement the painful reforms in order to preserve germany ’ s social security system . as to be expected , the spd left wing and trade unions immediately attacked the commission 's recommendations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula engelen-kefer " the rürup commission proposals on the future of state pensions are a cold rejection of social justice and sustainable reform , " said ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the german trade union federation . added to the anger over the proposed welfare cuts , a revolt over the pension proposals could present schröder with an unpalatable choice .
unless he is able to get the spd firmly behind his reforms , it is likely he will have to use the party congress in june as a quasi-confidence vote on his leadership . but first he will have to weather rough days ahead , especially as the unions and left-wing hardliners use next week ’ s traditional may day celebrations across the country to rally opposition to the reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd split widens on schröder reforms germany 's chancellor faced intensified criticism from spd left wing rebels over easter , as the threat of a vote of confidence in him moves ever closer .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giscard d 'estaing -lrb- right -rrb- gestures next to eu commissioner romano prodi during a press conference in athens in april .
according to eu commissioner romano prodi -lrb- right , with giscard -rrb- , giscard 's blueprint failed to capture the spirit of reform that was discussed at the latest eu summit in athens . the reform could lead to unequal treatment of member states , and would jeopardize trust between them , he said .
also , he said , the move would create rival bureaucracies and undermine accountability and effectiveness .
" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .
duplication of bureaucracies goes against common sense and against indications coming from all sides , " the eu executive said in a statement .
following closed-door debate on wednesday , the convention 's presidium eventually forced giscard to drop the idea of the vice presidency , and pushed off the idea of the smaller commission to the distant future .
' autistic ' proposal however , it held on to the idea of the permanent president of the european council , the bloc 's highest political body , who would prepare and chair eu summits .
it also upheld the idea of the foreign minister , to be appointed by eu leaders but with a seat on the commission , to conduct the bloc 's emerging common foreign and security policy .
speaking for the european parliament , senior christian democrat elmar brok condemned giscard 's proposals as " autistic . "
" this is purely about reducing the powers of smaller eu countries , the commission and the european parliament , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .

" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .
echoing the line taken by the government , rürup and the commission ’ s other experts said there was little choice but to implement the painful reforms in order to preserve germany ’ s social security system . as to be expected , the spd left wing and trade unions immediately attacked the commission 's recommendations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula engelen-kefer " the rürup commission proposals on the future of state pensions are a cold rejection of social justice and sustainable reform , " said ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the german trade union federation . added to the anger over the proposed welfare cuts , a revolt over the pension proposals could present schröder with an unpalatable choice .
unless he is able to get the spd firmly behind his reforms , it is likely he will have to use the party congress in june as a quasi-confidence vote on his leadership . but first he will have to weather rough days ahead , especially as the unions and left-wing hardliners use next week ’ s traditional may day celebrations across the country to rally opposition to the reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd split widens on schröder reforms germany 's chancellor faced intensified criticism from spd left wing rebels over easter , as the threat of a vote of confidence in him moves ever closer .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .

also , he said , the move would create rival bureaucracies and undermine accountability and effectiveness .
" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .
duplication of bureaucracies goes against common sense and against indications coming from all sides , " the eu executive said in a statement .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .
echoing the line taken by the government , rürup and the commission ’ s other experts said there was little choice but to implement the painful reforms in order to preserve germany ’ s social security system . as to be expected , the spd left wing and trade unions immediately attacked the commission 's recommendations .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .

controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .

according to eu commissioner romano prodi -lrb- right , with giscard -rrb- , giscard 's blueprint failed to capture the spirit of reform that was discussed at the latest eu summit in athens . the reform could lead to unequal treatment of member states , and would jeopardize trust between them , he said .
also , he said , the move would create rival bureaucracies and undermine accountability and effectiveness .
" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .
duplication of bureaucracies goes against common sense and against indications coming from all sides , " the eu executive said in a statement .
following closed-door debate on wednesday , the convention 's presidium eventually forced giscard to drop the idea of the vice presidency , and pushed off the idea of the smaller commission to the distant future .
' autistic ' proposal however , it held on to the idea of the permanent president of the european council , the bloc 's highest political body , who would prepare and chair eu summits .
it also upheld the idea of the foreign minister , to be appointed by eu leaders but with a seat on the commission , to conduct the bloc 's emerging common foreign and security policy .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .
but left-wing hardliners have not yet given up the fight . chancellor schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms that aim to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system .
but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . schröder met top spd officials at his home in hannover on thursday evening in what was billed as a routine strategy session .
but in a brief statement to the press , the chancellor left little doubt that how to counter opposition to his reform proposals dominated the meeting . “ anyone opposing their own party is playing with fire , because they are playing with the administration ’ s ability to govern , ” schröder said .
“ we are determined to implement agenda 2010 – exactly how i presented it to the german bundestag . ” stakes are high making sure spd backbenchers know just how high the stakes are set will be key in determining the government ’ s success in pushing through the painful welfare and labor market reforms , which would cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . despite the latest warning from the chancellor , the spd left-wing on friday still appeared prepared to use a special party congress on june 1 for a showdown over the reforms .
the anti-reform party members argue the proposals will irreparably damage the german welfare state . “ i am convinced that continuing with the current course will over the mid-term lead to the loss of the government ’ s ability to act , ” spd left-wing hardliner ottmar schreiner told zdf television . taking the battle to the spd rebels , the government showed it was prepared to open a second front on thursday , as a government-sponsored commission presented its reform suggestions for the german pensions system earlier than expected .
at the core of the proposals are plans to have germans work longer and receive smaller pensions . working longer bert rürup , the head of the commission , said the retirement age should begin to rise to 67 from 65 after 2011 .
people who would retire early would be penalized .
echoing the line taken by the government , rürup and the commission ’ s other experts said there was little choice but to implement the painful reforms in order to preserve germany ’ s social security system . as to be expected , the spd left wing and trade unions immediately attacked the commission 's recommendations .

six months or five years ?
controversy over the length of the eu presidency is expected to dominate talks today as the convention on the future of europe continues its debate . valery giscard d 'estaing , ex-president of france and current president of the convention on the future of europe , is always good for making surprising , publicity-getting comments .
for example , late last year he revved up the debate over turkey 's proposed entry into the eu by saying such an event would be " the end of the eu . "
with his latest suggestion giscard has once again raised hackles at the european commission and european parliament .
on wednesday giscard called for a permanent european union chairman chosen by eu leaders to replace the present six-month rotation of the eu presidency among member states .
struggle for power the surprise proposal - that the eu presidency switch from a rotating six-month appointment to a term that would last between two-and-a-half and five years - threw the convention for a loop yesterday and brought a long-standing eu power struggle into focus .
the idea is expected to dominate debate today as all 105 convention members gather for talks on the future shape of eu institutions . the convention is due to present a draft constitution to eu leaders by the end of june .
the 15-nation eu is slated to be joined by 10 new members in may , 2004 .
in addition to the permanent presidency , giscard suggested the creation of an eu vice president , a powerful joint eu foreign minister , and a new , smaller commission to steer eu business .
the " big five " eu states - france , germany , britain , italy and spain - all favor the idea of the long-term presidency , but the majority of smaller countries , as well as the federally-minded european parliament and current executive commission , oppose it .
they fear such a strong presidency and smaller commission would sap their authority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giscard d 'estaing -lrb- right -rrb- gestures next to eu commissioner romano prodi during a press conference in athens in april .
according to eu commissioner romano prodi -lrb- right , with giscard -rrb- , giscard 's blueprint failed to capture the spirit of reform that was discussed at the latest eu summit in athens . the reform could lead to unequal treatment of member states , and would jeopardize trust between them , he said .
also , he said , the move would create rival bureaucracies and undermine accountability and effectiveness .
" increasing the number of presidents and vice presidents , setting up a bureau , can only bring confusion .
duplication of bureaucracies goes against common sense and against indications coming from all sides , " the eu executive said in a statement .
following closed-door debate on wednesday , the convention 's presidium eventually forced giscard to drop the idea of the vice presidency , and pushed off the idea of the smaller commission to the distant future .
' autistic ' proposal however , it held on to the idea of the permanent president of the european council , the bloc 's highest political body , who would prepare and chair eu summits .
it also upheld the idea of the foreign minister , to be appointed by eu leaders but with a seat on the commission , to conduct the bloc 's emerging common foreign and security policy .
speaking for the european parliament , senior christian democrat elmar brok condemned giscard 's proposals as " autistic . "
" this is purely about reducing the powers of smaller eu countries , the commission and the european parliament , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

ministers representing the member states said the move involved reducing extra supplies introduced before the iraq war , while simultaneously lifting official output quotas .
under the plan , the cartel 's official output ceiling will rise by 900,000 barrels a day -lrb- b / d -rrb- to 25.4 million b / d while overproduction will be eliminated .
but analysts questioned whether the planned cut in actual output would be sufficient to support prices .
i do n't think there was anything they could have done to support this market tim evans , ifr pegasus " this is a highly confusing decision and it sends a very confusing message to the market , " said raad alkadiri , analyst at washington-based pfc energy .
" it looks like they have precluded any return of iraq oil before june , and are effectively sharing iraq 's market share between them . "
output had averaged 27.4 million b / d in february and march as producers with spare capacity , such as saudi arabia , boosted output to ease fears in major consuming countries that war on iraq would disrupt middle east oil supplies and lead to sharp price rises .
spiralling lower those concerns have since subsided and prices have fallen from near $ 40 a barrel before the war to about $ 24 a barrel for brent crude oil - the world benchmark .
brent dropped 70 cents to $ 23.57 a barrel after opec announced its decision .
" i do n't think there was anything they could have done to support this market .
production was just too high , " said tim evans of ifr pegasus in new york .
but overnight in asia , the mixed signals from opec meant the price of us crude oil crept up 20 cents to $ 26.85 a barrel .
opec policy is to keep oil prices within a $ 22-28 a barrel trading range , trimming or lifting supplies as necessary to achieve this .
the cartel 's fear is that prices will be sent spiralling lower by the combination of its own oversupply , falling demand as the northern hemisphere winter ends , and the expected return to the market of oil from iraq - an opec member operating outside the quota system .
ahead of schedule many questions over iraq 's return to the market - and re-integration into opec 's quota system - remain unanswered .
the country was not represented at the opec meeting and will not resume exports until a new government takes shape and the future of un sanctions and the oil-for-food programme is resolved .
us military officials said on wednesday that plans to re-start production in iraq 's southern oilfields were ahead of schedule and 50,000 barrels had been pumped during the day .
production in the northern fields was expected to be restored to 800,000 b / d in two to six weeks from 21 april , they said .
before the war , iraq was pumping about 2.5 million b / d - 1.7 million in the south and 800,000 in the north .
opec 's new quota arrangements are effective on 1 june .
saudi oil minister ali naimi said it was " very , very possible " that opec would decide again to cut production when it meets in qatar on 11 june .

donald carty stepped down from the airline 's parent company , amr , following anger over the revelation of a special $ 41m pension fund for the airline 's management , together with bonuses worth twice their salary .
unions representing the airline 's staff were furious that just as they were being asked to agree to sweeping pay cuts and a range of other cutbacks , fresh perks for management were being kept secret from them .
on wednesday , amr announced a loss of more than a $ 1bn -lrb- £ 660m -rrb- dollars in the first quarter of this year amid the worst environment for airlines in years .
it 's a perilous climate and our success is far from assured don carty ex-amr chairman the aviation business was already in trouble thanks to over-capacity , before the 11 september attacks on the us froze flights for several days and made many people unwilling to fly .
since then , the ongoing economic slowdown , the uncertainty preceding the us ' attack on iraq and the spread of the sars virus have only made matters worse for the industry .
one to go amr 's new chief executive gerard arpey could still be leading his company into bankruptcy within days .
news agencies reported that the company has already lined up bankruptcy financing of $ 1.75bn in preparation .
much depends on whether the union representing flight attendants will endorse cuts to their pay packages .
its negotiators have said they face additional cuts over and above those faced by other staff .
pilots ' and mechanics ' representatives have already signed up , having threatened to re-ballot their staff in the immediate aftermath of the executive pay revelations .
as for amr , the pension fund remains , but the bonuses for executives have been scrapped .
' brutal ' environment mr carty painted a bleak picture of american 's immediate prospects as the results were announced earlier this week .
" the fact remains that we are confronting a brutally difficult financial and business environment , " he said .
american airlines staff are fuming " we are beset on all sides by a struggling economy , the continued uncertainties regarding hostilities in the middle east , concerns regarding the sars outbreak , fuel prices that are significantly higher than they were a year ago , and fare levels that are at 30-year lows .
" all told , it 's a perilous climate and our success is far from assured . "

he is the executive director of the education for peace in iraq centre , and a co-founder of the veterans for common sense .
it was a very empowering time before the war started .
it felt like democracy was working , and the media was doing an excellent job in laying out the arguments .
over 160 cities and towns had passed resolutions against the war , and even the trade union federation the afl-cio , representing 13m workers , had done the same .
momentum seemed to be on our side , and if we failed to prevent the war , it seemed to be because the president was not listening .
war ultimatum i felt betrayed when i heard president george w bush 's ultimatum .
i felt that all the talk about compelling the regime to disarm had been a game - all the time this administration had been hell-bent on war , and all the talk about weapons of mass destruction had been a game .
it had all been about selling the war , and giving it a fig leaf of legality .
and it was going to do great harm to us relations with the rest of the world .
there was a disconnect between my experiences of the brutality of the fighting and the hollywood version of the war on cnn erik gustafson it was a very strange experience to watch this war unfolding on television .
when i had returned from the last gulf war , there was a disconnect between my experiences of the brutality of the fighting , and the clean , precision , hollywood version of the war on cnn .
i stopped telling people about my experiences because it was too painful .
now , i was horrified to see the cheerleading on networks like fox and how that would affect those who had experienced combat .
i was struggling with a lot of emotions .
i was glad to see pictures of the troops on the ground from embedded reporters .
i felt i could see and feel what they were feeling .
i felt it was natural for them , being in harm 's way and having to kill , to be able to justify the war as just and honourable - and getting rid of saddam hussein did do that for the soldiers .
looting baghdad i was furious about the looting of baghdad , and the colossal loss , not just of human life , but of the treasures of civilisation held at the national museum .
but in a way i expected it , as i knew about the long debate with the army about having more troops on the ground .
it was always going to be a gamble , risking supply lines .
but the delay in established order has already cost lives as humanitarian aid could not reach the people who needed it .
i think it will be an enormous challenge to create democracy in iraq , and not just install pentagon placemen like ahmed chalabi .
i would like to see the international community involved in giving legitimacy to any new regime , but i do n't have a lot of confidence that the bush administration will accept that .
planning for the future i am on my way to a three-day retreat with other peace organisations to discuss the next steps we should take .
we have built a very broad movement , and we have to build on that , and play a powerful role in electoral politics .
we need to oppose the radical shift by the bush administration to the doctrine of pre-emptive war .
and we need to work towards constitutional change , where congress and the courts will act as more of a check on the right of the president to declare war .
i am very discouraged by what is happening in iraq , but i have faith in the international community and ultimately in the american people to build a stronger democracy .
ultimately we are witnessing over-reach , and at least we live in a system where that could be self-corrected by elections in 2004 .

he is the executive director of the education for peace in iraq centre , and a co-founder of the veterans for common sense .
it was a very empowering time before the war started .
it felt like democracy was working , and the media was doing an excellent job in laying out the arguments .
over 160 cities and towns had passed resolutions against the war , and even the trade union federation the afl-cio , representing 13m workers , had done the same .
momentum seemed to be on our side , and if we failed to prevent the war , it seemed to be because the president was not listening .
war ultimatum i felt betrayed when i heard president george w bush 's ultimatum .
i felt that all the talk about compelling the regime to disarm had been a game - all the time this administration had been hell-bent on war , and all the talk about weapons of mass destruction had been a game .
it had all been about selling the war , and giving it a fig leaf of legality .
and it was going to do great harm to us relations with the rest of the world .
there was a disconnect between my experiences of the brutality of the fighting and the hollywood version of the war on cnn erik gustafson it was a very strange experience to watch this war unfolding on television .
when i had returned from the last gulf war , there was a disconnect between my experiences of the brutality of the fighting , and the clean , precision , hollywood version of the war on cnn .
i stopped telling people about my experiences because it was too painful .
now , i was horrified to see the cheerleading on networks like fox and how that would affect those who had experienced combat .
i was struggling with a lot of emotions .
i was glad to see pictures of the troops on the ground from embedded reporters .
i felt i could see and feel what they were feeling .
i felt it was natural for them , being in harm 's way and having to kill , to be able to justify the war as just and honourable - and getting rid of saddam hussein did do that for the soldiers .
looting baghdad i was furious about the looting of baghdad , and the colossal loss , not just of human life , but of the treasures of civilisation held at the national museum .
but in a way i expected it , as i knew about the long debate with the army about having more troops on the ground .
it was always going to be a gamble , risking supply lines .
but the delay in established order has already cost lives as humanitarian aid could not reach the people who needed it .
i think it will be an enormous challenge to create democracy in iraq , and not just install pentagon placemen like ahmed chalabi .
i would like to see the international community involved in giving legitimacy to any new regime , but i do n't have a lot of confidence that the bush administration will accept that .
planning for the future i am on my way to a three-day retreat with other peace organisations to discuss the next steps we should take .
we have built a very broad movement , and we have to build on that , and play a powerful role in electoral politics .
we need to oppose the radical shift by the bush administration to the doctrine of pre-emptive war .
and we need to work towards constitutional change , where congress and the courts will act as more of a check on the right of the president to declare war .
i am very discouraged by what is happening in iraq , but i have faith in the international community and ultimately in the american people to build a stronger democracy .
ultimately we are witnessing over-reach , and at least we live in a system where that could be self-corrected by elections in 2004 .

chief executive carlos ghosn says nissan will pour more money into the sunderland plant to start building its new almera only if the uk has signalled it will join the euro .
mr ghosn warned if not , the company would take its money elsewhere .
nissan wants to start building the replacement almera in 2004 .
mr ghosn said : " if the signs are clear and reassuring , we will reinvest in sunderland .
" if there are too many risks we will go elsewhere .
" we want our main cost base in europe to be in the same currency as our receipts . "
the sunderland plant currently employs about 4,900 workers building the new micra car .
sars virus threat mr ghosn also warned the sars virus world would hit its business , and that of its competitors .
he said : " it will slow us down - us and our competitors .
" we have had to limit trips by engineers to china and put people coming back in quarantine .
" it will impact our progress , but it will not be significant in terms of nissan 's global results . "
nissan decided to produce the micra in sunderland rather than in france where both its costs and its revenues would be in euros .
in a close decision , sunderland was chosen because it was , and still is , europe 's most efficient car manufacturing plant .
