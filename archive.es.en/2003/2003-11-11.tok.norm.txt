with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .
first the political effects of hohmann 's alleged anti-semitic speech had to be awaited .
merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report almost two weeks ago .
since then , a national debate has broken out about a recent spate of apparently anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .

only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .

party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.11.2003 iraqi expat plays matchmaker for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the investments start pouring in , there will be fewer mannequins like this collecting dust .
with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .
" that ’ s just how it is with arab countries .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .
" that ’ s just how it is with arab countries .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .
first the political effects of hohmann 's alleged anti-semitic speech had to be awaited .
merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report almost two weeks ago .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .
first the political effects of hohmann 's alleged anti-semitic speech had to be awaited .
merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report almost two weeks ago .
since then , a national debate has broken out about a recent spate of apparently anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .

only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .

" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.11.2003 iraqi expat plays matchmaker for german firms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the investments start pouring in , there will be fewer mannequins like this collecting dust .
with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .
" that ’ s just how it is with arab countries .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .
" that ’ s just how it is with arab countries .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .

i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .
" that ’ s just how it is with arab countries .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .
first the political effects of hohmann 's alleged anti-semitic speech had to be awaited .
merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report almost two weeks ago .
since then , a national debate has broken out about a recent spate of apparently anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .
last week , the government sacked former brigadier gen. reinhard günzel , head of germany ’ s ksk special forces , after he publicly endorsed hohmann ’ s comments . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu fears party rift over anti-semitism scandal christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .
first the political effects of hohmann 's alleged anti-semitic speech had to be awaited .
merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report almost two weeks ago .
since then , a national debate has broken out about a recent spate of apparently anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .
last week , the government sacked former brigadier gen. reinhard günzel , head of germany ’ s ksk special forces , after he publicly endorsed hohmann ’ s comments . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu fears party rift over anti-semitism scandal christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .

eastern european heavyweights that moved quicker , like poland and the czech republic , have been stumbling of late after seeing their economies boom in the 1990s . since formally joining at a conference in copenhagen a year ago , some of the ten members continue to fight with brussels over farm subsidies and rights for their workers to get employed in the west . the spats seem to be a portent of things to come . major repairs are still needed in state-run health and education systems , and minority rights - like those of the eastern european gypsy population - need to be guaranteed . dw-world looks at the readiness and abilities of the 10 candidate countries slated to join the european union in 2004 . dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .

estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .
hungary : winning economic record should get it in a debilitated health and education sector and corruption remain concerns , but hungary has had the economic success record needed for european union accession in 2004 .
latvia : second time 's a charm in late november , latvia joined the military alliance created to fight against its former patron , the soviet union .
now , the baltic nation is scheduled to begin accession talks with the european union next month .
lithuania : an end to a painful history lithuania sees eu membership as a guarantee for its economic stability , for its independence , and as a safeguard from its russian neighbor .
malta : skeptical populace , other hurdles remain malta , an island situated between sicily and the north african coast , is well known as a haven of low tax and high savings .
not surprisingly perhaps , many maltese are scared of the costs of eu entry .
poland : lobbying until the very end poland is the largest and most complex of european union candidates .
the country has been fighting hard to enter on its own terms , which includes lobbying for large farming subsidies .
czech republic : rough patches on way to the eu since the tumult of 1989 , the czech republic has become a stable , if rowdy democracy with a workable market economy .
but there is still plenty of scope for nitpicking and upsets before the “ big bang ” in 2004 .
slovakia : a determined march westward first nato , now the eu : nine years after breaking off of czechoslovakia , slovakia is steaming ahead to the west , even if its economy isn ’ t quite there yet .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .

it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .
" that ’ s just how it is with arab countries .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .
first the political effects of hohmann 's alleged anti-semitic speech had to be awaited .
merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "

" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .

merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report almost two weeks ago .
since then , a national debate has broken out about a recent spate of apparently anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.11.2003 testing the 10 for many of the 10 new countries , european union membership are landmark steps in short , turbulent histories that followed the collapse of the soviet empire . small countries like lithuania and latvia , heavily dependent on trade with russia , have had to move quickly to open their markets and trade to the west .
eastern european heavyweights that moved quicker , like poland and the czech republic , have been stumbling of late after seeing their economies boom in the 1990s . since formally joining at a conference in copenhagen a year ago , some of the ten members continue to fight with brussels over farm subsidies and rights for their workers to get employed in the west . the spats seem to be a portent of things to come . major repairs are still needed in state-run health and education systems , and minority rights - like those of the eastern european gypsy population - need to be guaranteed . dw-world looks at the readiness and abilities of the 10 candidate countries slated to join the european union in 2004 . dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .
and with the united nations ' plan proposing reunification for the divided island , the prospects are looking even brighter .
estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .
hungary : winning economic record should get it in a debilitated health and education sector and corruption remain concerns , but hungary has had the economic success record needed for european union accession in 2004 .
latvia : second time 's a charm in late november , latvia joined the military alliance created to fight against its former patron , the soviet union .
now , the baltic nation is scheduled to begin accession talks with the european union next month .
lithuania : an end to a painful history lithuania sees eu membership as a guarantee for its economic stability , for its independence , and as a safeguard from its russian neighbor .
malta : skeptical populace , other hurdles remain malta , an island situated between sicily and the north african coast , is well known as a haven of low tax and high savings .
not surprisingly perhaps , many maltese are scared of the costs of eu entry .
poland : lobbying until the very end poland is the largest and most complex of european union candidates .
the country has been fighting hard to enter on its own terms , which includes lobbying for large farming subsidies .
czech republic : rough patches on way to the eu since the tumult of 1989 , the czech republic has become a stable , if rowdy democracy with a workable market economy .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .

with 20 years of business experience in germany and iraq , iraqi expatriate gelan khulusi works to bring small companies from the two countries together . gelan khulusi sits with a designer in his office putting the finishing touches on his new internet homepage .
in the same breath , he turns to another colleague and discusses the latest requests coming in from companies in germany and iraq .
it is just another day in the life for khulusi , who runs midan , arabic for " marketplace , " a new non-profit organization that is playing matchmaker between german and iraqi businesses .
" this just came in from an iraqi investment firm , " the 40-year-old says .
" they ’ re looking for a construction partner .
and what they want is cooperation .
they ’ ve got property to offer ... and qualified personnel . "
since he founded midan in july , khulusi has been receiving faxes like this at his cologne-based office supply company everyday .
khulusi left iraq in 1980 and has been in germany for more than 20 years now .
a graduate of a german business school , he ’ s maintained his business ties with iraq throughout .
now , he ’ s seeking to take what he learned and apply it to small and medium-sized german and iraqi businesses who want to work together during the reconstruction of the gulf country .
mr. manners since the considerable differences in cultural and business etiquette between the two countries can often break seemingly sure-fire deals , the acumen of consultants like khulusi is in high demand .
it ’ s often the small things that businessmen need to watch out for .
" one unpleasant custom , especially in southern germany , is that people tend to tap their partners on the shoulder after they close a deal , " he says .
" in arab culture , that ’ s considered a negative sign .
it means , ‘ you dummy , i just took you to the cleaners . ’ "
other customs , courtesies in germany , often become pitfalls in iraq .
" for example , in an arab country , you don ’ t ask your business partner , ‘ so , how ’ s your wife doing ? ’ "
instead , khulusi suggests , german businessmen should ask how the potential business partner ’ s family is doing .
getting germans to invest but these days , khulusi has even bigger concerns than cultural nuances .
he ’ s currently drumming up interest among german companies to invest in iraq - and there ’ s plenty of opportunity for companies willing to take the risk .
" iraq is like a sponge that ’ s been lying in the sun for 30 years , " he says .
" now a few drops of water are being poured on it – they ’ ll immediately be absorbed without obstacle .
the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .

the midan organization is also in the position in iraq right now that , when we go to the chamber of commerce and tell them , ‘ listen , i have this and this and this , ’ the answer is almost always , ‘ great , when can we start ? ’ "
historically , germany has been among iraq 's biggest trading partners .
in 1982 , germany exported € 4 billion worth of products to iraq .
and even during the embargo , when contracts for exports and services were controlled by the u.n. , german companies still export € 400 million -lrb- $ 436 million -rrb- worth of products each year .
security concerns hinder deals but times are different now , and in postwar iraq , german businesses have been slow in investing .
many are concerned about the lack of security and the almost daily terror attacks that have left hundreds dead .
khulusi understands their fears .
that ’ s why he wants to serve as the middleman and remove the more dangerous part of the businesses by handling negotiations for them in iraq .
a mcdonald ’ s for baghdad ?
one start-up project khulusi is working on for a german company is a fast food restaurant modeled after mcdonalds that would be financed by german investors but operated by iraqi workers in central baghdad .
the main investor , a restaurant manager , already has experience in other arab countries , but he ’ s seeking khulusi ’ s help in tapping the iraqi market .
but even khulusi concedes that it may be difficult to line up enough investors given the current lack of security .
still , the entrepreneur says he wants khulusi to do his bidding .
" it ’ s also because a lot in iraq has to do with personal relationships , " the entrepreneur says .
" that ’ s just how it is with arab countries .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
and green party chairman reinhard bütikofer described hohmann ’ s exclusion from the cdu as the " democratic minimum . "
" it took a long time , " he told the newspaper .
" and there ’ s no gold medal for that . "
but merkel rebuffed the criticism .
such a far-ranging decision should n't be made hastily but must grow , she said in television interviews with broadcasters ard and zdf .
first the political effects of hohmann 's alleged anti-semitic speech had to be awaited .
merkel said she had hoped that hohmann would distance himself from his statements .
in october , hohmann gave a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators . "
the contents of that speech became highly publicized after a public television station broadcast a report almost two weeks ago .
since then , a national debate has broken out about a recent spate of apparently anti-semitic sentiment among german politicians and military leaders .
last week , the government sacked former brigadier gen. reinhard günzel , head of germany ’ s ksk special forces , after he publicly endorsed hohmann ’ s comments . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu fears party rift over anti-semitism scandal christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures .

but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .

i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .
' overdue ' " this step was overdue , " michael müller , the social democrats ’ deputy parliamentary group leader , told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .

in a dramatic reversal on monday , leaders of germany ’ s main opposition party said they would seek to remove a member of their party accused of having made discriminatory comments about jews . the move came after senior party leaders initially gave the christian democrat union ’ s -lrb- cdu -rrb- martin hohmann a slap on the wrist .
earlier the party forced the parliamentarian from the state of hessen to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee and instead move over to the environmental committee .
but on monday , hessen 's premier roland koch , who is head of the state 's christian democrats , said he would submit a request to have hohmann banned from the party .
the move came after the head of the national cdu , angela merkel , said she would seek to have hohmann removed from the party ’ s group in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
" this is a logical consequence of angela merkel ’ s decision , " koch told reporters , following a meeting of parliamentary group leaders .
" if mr. hohmann is expelled from the parliamentary group , then he can also no longer be a member of the party .
there ’ s a direct relation between the two .
i agreed with angela merkel about that . "
only a national party leader or the head of the state chapter of a political party is permitted to submit an application to have someone banned from the bundestag , according to the cdu ’ s party rules .
the parliamentary group is expected to vote on friday whether to expell hohmann .
his further political fate will be left up to a party tribunal in his home state .
' great damage ' to the party " hohmann ’ s statements and the subsequent public debate greatly damaged the union , " koch said .
maria böhmer , a member of the party ’ s parliamentary group board , told reporters monday ’ s decision came after hohmann refused to distance himself from the anti-semitic statements , adding that there was unequivocal support in the group to submit an application for his removal .
party head merkel accused hohmann of discrediting ideas that were important to the cdu .
national-conservative voters must be protected , she said .
" that we can say : we are proud of our country " is a core component of the party 's policies , merkel said .
but it must be done in an unprejudiced manner , " not on the backs of third parties " as hohmann had , merkel said in an interview with television broadcaster zdf on tuesday .
politicians from the ruling government coalition hailed the decision in interviews with the news media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.11.2003 testing the 10 for many of the 10 new countries , european union membership are landmark steps in short , turbulent histories that followed the collapse of the soviet empire . small countries like lithuania and latvia , heavily dependent on trade with russia , have had to move quickly to open their markets and trade to the west .
eastern european heavyweights that moved quicker , like poland and the czech republic , have been stumbling of late after seeing their economies boom in the 1990s . since formally joining at a conference in copenhagen a year ago , some of the ten members continue to fight with brussels over farm subsidies and rights for their workers to get employed in the west . the spats seem to be a portent of things to come . major repairs are still needed in state-run health and education systems , and minority rights - like those of the eastern european gypsy population - need to be guaranteed . dw-world looks at the readiness and abilities of the 10 candidate countries slated to join the european union in 2004 . dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .
and with the united nations ' plan proposing reunification for the divided island , the prospects are looking even brighter .
estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .
hungary : winning economic record should get it in a debilitated health and education sector and corruption remain concerns , but hungary has had the economic success record needed for european union accession in 2004 .
latvia : second time 's a charm in late november , latvia joined the military alliance created to fight against its former patron , the soviet union .
now , the baltic nation is scheduled to begin accession talks with the european union next month .
lithuania : an end to a painful history lithuania sees eu membership as a guarantee for its economic stability , for its independence , and as a safeguard from its russian neighbor .
malta : skeptical populace , other hurdles remain malta , an island situated between sicily and the north african coast , is well known as a haven of low tax and high savings .
not surprisingly perhaps , many maltese are scared of the costs of eu entry .
poland : lobbying until the very end poland is the largest and most complex of european union candidates .
the country has been fighting hard to enter on its own terms , which includes lobbying for large farming subsidies .
czech republic : rough patches on way to the eu since the tumult of 1989 , the czech republic has become a stable , if rowdy democracy with a workable market economy .
but there is still plenty of scope for nitpicking and upsets before the “ big bang ” in 2004 .
slovakia : a determined march westward first nato , now the eu : nine years after breaking off of czechoslovakia , slovakia is steaming ahead to the west , even if its economy isn ’ t quite there yet .
slovenia : ready for a long time already while slovenia was part of yugoslavia , it was the most liberal and the most prosperous region of the federation .
its war of independence lasted only ten days , claiming no more than a handful of lives .

eastern european heavyweights that moved quicker , like poland and the czech republic , have been stumbling of late after seeing their economies boom in the 1990s . since formally joining at a conference in copenhagen a year ago , some of the ten members continue to fight with brussels over farm subsidies and rights for their workers to get employed in the west . the spats seem to be a portent of things to come . major repairs are still needed in state-run health and education systems , and minority rights - like those of the eastern european gypsy population - need to be guaranteed . dw-world looks at the readiness and abilities of the 10 candidate countries slated to join the european union in 2004 . dw-world.de a divided cyprus makes the cut cyprus is one of the countries most ready to join the european union .
and with the united nations ' plan proposing reunification for the divided island , the prospects are looking even brighter .
estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .
hungary : winning economic record should get it in a debilitated health and education sector and corruption remain concerns , but hungary has had the economic success record needed for european union accession in 2004 .
latvia : second time 's a charm in late november , latvia joined the military alliance created to fight against its former patron , the soviet union .
now , the baltic nation is scheduled to begin accession talks with the european union next month .
lithuania : an end to a painful history lithuania sees eu membership as a guarantee for its economic stability , for its independence , and as a safeguard from its russian neighbor .
malta : skeptical populace , other hurdles remain malta , an island situated between sicily and the north african coast , is well known as a haven of low tax and high savings .
not surprisingly perhaps , many maltese are scared of the costs of eu entry .
poland : lobbying until the very end poland is the largest and most complex of european union candidates .
the country has been fighting hard to enter on its own terms , which includes lobbying for large farming subsidies .
czech republic : rough patches on way to the eu since the tumult of 1989 , the czech republic has become a stable , if rowdy democracy with a workable market economy .
but there is still plenty of scope for nitpicking and upsets before the “ big bang ” in 2004 .

the number of barn owls nationally has gone down by almost 70 % since the 1930s , mainly because of intensive farming and developments on green field sites .
but half of all recorded deaths of barn owls are road casualties .
the study was carried out by the devon-based barn owl trust over a 15-year period and shows that , unless action is taken soon , the uk barn owl population is unlikely to recover .
nest sites the trust is now using the results to put pressure on farming and highways authorities .
there are now only 4,000 pairs of barn owls left in the wild .
each year , they will produce 10,000 young owls , but about 3,000 of those birds are being killed in road accidents .
the research showed that in the nesting season , from march to august , all adult barn owls whose nest site is within half a kilometre -lrb- 0.3 miles -rrb- of a major road are almost certain to be killed .
road deaths also have more impact on barn owls than any other creature .
the trust wants to see more barn owl-friendly habitats on farms the trust , based in ashburton , is now calling for a complete end to new major roads being built in rural areas where barn owls are present within a 25 kilometre -lrb- 15.5 mile -rrb- radius .
this includes motorways , dual carriageways and local bypasses .
continuous three-metre -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- high screens of trees and hedges should also be provided alongside existing main roads , so barn owls can fly over the traffic .
the charity also wants to see more barn owl-friendly habitats created on farms , but well away from main roads .
trust spokesman david ramsden said : " we 've known for many years that barn owls are being killed on roads because we 've been picking up the casualties .
" one of the really important findings is that the animals being killed in road accidents are those which would have lived .
" road accidents are killing those which have survived through their early life . "

it added that it now expects to lose $ 100m for the year as a whole , against earlier forecasts of a $ 90m profit .

mitsubishi , japan 's fourth biggest car maker , held out little hope of an immediate turnaround .
" prospects for the global economy remain obscure under the unstable currency movement , and despite some signs of recovery in the us , " it said in a statement .

jim mather and jeremy purvis have been tasked with looking at customer charges , the structure of the industry , its debt burden and the role of ministers and the water commissioner .
their work will take place ahead of a full investigation at the beginning of december .
the move comes on the day it was announced that scottish companies are to be given the chance to confront scottish water over bills some businesses claim are a threat to their future .
the federation of small businesses -lrb- fsb -rrb- said many firms had seen a surge in the amount they paid and wanted a fairer system .
water commissioner alan sutherland said the industry was getting more efficient , but households were still paying about £ 80 a year too much .
now , some businesses have said that their bills had risen by up to 500 % in the past two years .
future charges they claim the increases threaten their future and are calling for an overhaul of the system of charging .
the move was welcomed by the fsb , but it said it wanted a full and open debate about future charges at the meeting on tuesday evening .
a report on monday showed scottish water had reduced its operating costs by £ 3m , or nearly 10 % , in its first year .
the body 's current operating costs were running at £ 351.2m in 2002-03 .
i believe it deserves the support of customers , both household and business ross finnie environment minister to reach the operating cost target of £ 265m which mr sutherland has set for the industry , scottish water will have to achieve annual savings of more than 11 % for each of the next three years .
environment minister ross finnie welcomed the progress made so far .
the minister said the 10 % efficiency savings in operating costs and 5 % in procurement costs vindicated the executive 's decision to create scottish water and proved the system of regulation was working .
" scottish water still has further progress to make if it is to meet the targets that the water industry commissioner has set for 2005-06 , and i believe it deserves the support of customers , both household and business , in achieving this , " he said .

water commissioner alan sutherland said the industry was getting more efficient , but households were still paying about £ 80 a year too much .
now , some businesses have said that their bills had risen by up to 500 % in the past two years .
future charges they claim the increases threaten their future and are calling for an overhaul of the system of charging .
the move was welcomed by the fsb , but it said it wanted a full and open debate about future charges at the meeting on tuesday evening .
a report on monday showed scottish water had reduced its operating costs by £ 3m , or nearly 10 % , in its first year .
the body 's current operating costs were running at £ 351.2m in 2002-03 .
i believe it deserves the support of customers , both household and business ross finnie environment minister to reach the operating cost target of £ 265m which mr sutherland has set for the industry , scottish water will have to achieve annual savings of more than 11 % for each of the next three years .
environment minister ross finnie welcomed the progress made so far .
the minister said the 10 % efficiency savings in operating costs and 5 % in procurement costs vindicated the executive 's decision to create scottish water and proved the system of regulation was working .
" scottish water still has further progress to make if it is to meet the targets that the water industry commissioner has set for 2005-06 , and i believe it deserves the support of customers , both household and business , in achieving this , " he said .

numbers of lapwing have declined by as much as 75 % over the past 25 years , according to a report entitled the state of birds in wales , produced jointly by the royal society for the protection of birds , the countryside council for wales , and the welsh ornithological society .
it paints a mixed picture of how birdlife is faring in wales .
farmland species like the lapwing have plummeted , and 27 birds are on what conservationists call the " red list " - the register of birds considered most at risk of decline and in need of urgent protection .
the study raises concerns that , for many species , the current agri-enviroment schemes and conservation measures in place have yet to prove effective .
choughs are increasing in numbers but there is some good news .
although still under threat , numbers of black grouse and red kite are improving - largely thanks to long-term conservation programmes .
populations of chough - a red-legged member of the crow family found only on the lleyn peninsular and in pembrokeshire - also appear relatively healthy .
the report will be officially launched at the welsh assembly headquarters in cardiff bay on tuesday - with a 15ft model of a lapwing helping to drive the conservation message home .
the welsh assembly government is committed to using bird populations as an indicator of sustainable development , and the state of birds in wales report is the first annual publication focusing on the wild bird indicator for wales .

" a helicopter was searching overhead , police and firefighters came down to the beach .
" the search went on for about four hours .
mr phillips ' body washed ashore just before the sun went down , " ms carter explained .
the area has been the scene of many drownings and there are warning signs on the beach telling visitors to consult local people about the conditions before going in the sea .

the bombardier beetle fires a noxious , smelly chemical around 100 c in temperature from its bottom at any predator which tries to attack it .
and conservationists have found it living on a nature reserve near the aberthaw power station in the vale of glamorgan .
the beetle - brachinus crepitans - measures between six and 10 millimetres and makes the sound of breaking wind when defending itself when under attack .
it is the first time it has been spotted at the site since the 1980s .
alex coxhead , who is the reserve manager for the wildlife trust of south and west wales , looks after the aberthaw lagoon and saltmarsh nature reserve for the owners of the power station innogy .
it makes a sound like a ' parp ' with a lot of smoke and noise alex coxhead , wildlife trust of south and west wales " the beetle is very clever because it has developed this amazing anti-predator device , " he said .
" it fires two chemicals from chambers inside its body .
and it forms a chemical reaction when they mix , making an explosive sound .
" it makes a sound like a ' parp ' with a lot of smoke and noise , " he said .
but despite the violence of its defence mechanism , mr coxhead stressed that the beetle only used its gassy protection when a bird or small mammal attempts to eat it .
" they are not dangerous creatures - they are vegetarians and will only use their defensive stance when they feels in danger , " he said .
the beetle lives on the nature reserve near aberthaw power station " there are several different types of bombardier beetle , but this is the only type found in the uk , usually in southern england .
" they like coastal , limestone , grassy areas and i think this is why they are here in aberthaw because it has n't been developed by agriculture .
" now we know it is here , we are going to carry out a conservation exercise to protect it and the other wildlife here .
" we really hope that people will come down and have a look for themselves , " he added .

the beetle lives on the nature reserve near aberthaw power station " there are several different types of bombardier beetle , but this is the only type found in the uk , usually in southern england .
" they like coastal , limestone , grassy areas and i think this is why they are here in aberthaw because it has n't been developed by agriculture .
" now we know it is here , we are going to carry out a conservation exercise to protect it and the other wildlife here .
" we really hope that people will come down and have a look for themselves , " he added .
