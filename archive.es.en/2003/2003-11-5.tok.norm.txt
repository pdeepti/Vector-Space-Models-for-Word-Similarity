brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .
the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision on deadly force comes almost a year after german interior minister otto schily and struck agreed on a series of measures to increase flight safety within the framework of germany ’ s anti-terror legislation , which was passed after the sept .

next step in anti-terror legislation the first measures in the legislation included the use of armed air marshals on certain routes as well as increased protection of cockpit cabins , such as sealing off cabin doors during flights .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .
the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .

the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu . straddling two continents , turkey has long aspired to join the european union .
egged on by the fact that ten countries mostly from former communist east europe will become part of the eu next year , ankara has instituted a number of sweeping political and economic reforms over the past year .
but wednesday ’ s report by the european commission noted although the country had made progress on new laws regarding human rights and other reforms , implementation of the legislation was still spotty .
turkey hopes to win the right to start accession negotiations when eu leaders take stock of the country ’ s progress in december 2004 .
“ the deciding question is whether turkey delivers convincing proof in the next eight to ten months that it has seriously changed , ” eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen told the online service of der spiegel magazine .
“ it will depend on whether the reforms become reality and are not just on paper . ”

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .

the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .

the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .

it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2003 -pipe- 17:00 utc court rules home schooling unacceptable parents may not keep their children from attending school even if they give them lessons at home , a district court in giessen ruled wednesday .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .

the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu . straddling two continents , turkey has long aspired to join the european union .
egged on by the fact that ten countries mostly from former communist east europe will become part of the eu next year , ankara has instituted a number of sweeping political and economic reforms over the past year .
but wednesday ’ s report by the european commission noted although the country had made progress on new laws regarding human rights and other reforms , implementation of the legislation was still spotty .
turkey hopes to win the right to start accession negotiations when eu leaders take stock of the country ’ s progress in december 2004 .
“ the deciding question is whether turkey delivers convincing proof in the next eight to ten months that it has seriously changed , ” eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen told the online service of der spiegel magazine .
“ it will depend on whether the reforms become reality and are not just on paper . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2003 top general sacked as anti-semitism scandal spreads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigade general reinhard günzel was sacked by defense minister peter struck on tuesday german defense minister peter struck has fired the head of germany ’ s special forces after he voiced support for anti-semitic comments made by conservative mp martin hohmann . the anti-semitism row that has dominated the german press over the past week erupted again in dramatic style on tuesday when a top general in the german army was fired for expressing support for the comments made by martin hohmann , the conservative backbench member of parliament at the center of the storm .
brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "

in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .

he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .

pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "

proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .
the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision on deadly force comes almost a year after german interior minister otto schily and struck agreed on a series of measures to increase flight safety within the framework of germany ’ s anti-terror legislation , which was passed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
next step in anti-terror legislation the first measures in the legislation included the use of armed air marshals on certain routes as well as increased protection of cockpit cabins , such as sealing off cabin doors during flights .
the need for further steps became clear in january of this year when a german student stole a small private plane from frankfurt ’ s main airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2003 germany opts for deadly force in the sky großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air force attack jets could receive orders to take down hijacked passenger planes in the event of a hijacked airliner threatening loss of life on a major scale over a german city , the government will authorize jet fighters to bring the plane down , coalition officials agreed on wednesday . after months of heated discussions and deliberations , germany ’ s ruling coalition of social democrats and greens reached agreement on wednesday on the issue of deadly force in the event of the hijacking of a commercial airliner by terrorists .
politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .
the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision on deadly force comes almost a year after german interior minister otto schily and struck agreed on a series of measures to increase flight safety within the framework of germany ’ s anti-terror legislation , which was passed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
next step in anti-terror legislation the first measures in the legislation included the use of armed air marshals on certain routes as well as increased protection of cockpit cabins , such as sealing off cabin doors during flights .
the need for further steps became clear in january of this year when a german student stole a small private plane from frankfurt ’ s main airport .
he then circled the city and threatened to crash the plane into one of the city ’ s high-rise buildings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second anti-terror package presented to german parliament the german parliament debates the passage of a new anti-terror package today .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "

proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .

he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "

the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu . straddling two continents , turkey has long aspired to join the european union .
egged on by the fact that ten countries mostly from former communist east europe will become part of the eu next year , ankara has instituted a number of sweeping political and economic reforms over the past year .
but wednesday ’ s report by the european commission noted although the country had made progress on new laws regarding human rights and other reforms , implementation of the legislation was still spotty .
turkey hopes to win the right to start accession negotiations when eu leaders take stock of the country ’ s progress in december 2004 .
“ the deciding question is whether turkey delivers convincing proof in the next eight to ten months that it has seriously changed , ” eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen told the online service of der spiegel magazine .
“ it will depend on whether the reforms become reality and are not just on paper . ”
but criticism of the reform pace at home was not what riled the turks the most about the report .
instead it was the mention of the difficult issue of cyprus , which will join the eu next year .
specifically , brussels said the failure to reunite the divided island , of which turkey occupies the northern third , could present a “ serious obstacle ” to ankara ’ s bid to become part of the european bloc .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul had made a furious last ditch diplomatic push on tuesday night to keep cyprus out of the report but failed .
cyprus divided turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 to head off plans by the greek-dominated government to make cyprus part of greece , but the turkish part is only recognized by ankara .
after the report ’ s release , ankara took a more conciliatory line .
“ we all want a solution to the cyprus problem .
we will make a great effort to solve the problem before may 1 , 2004 , " gul told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
the united nations has blamed the stalled peace talks on cyprus on the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the row over cyprus has overshadowed the eu ’ s support for the turkish reform process recently accelerated by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
“ some of the reforms carry great political significance as they impinge on sensitive issues in the turkish context , such as freedom of expression , freedom of demonstration , cultural rights and civilian control over the military , ” the report said .
besides addressing a potential turkish candidacy , the eu report on wednesday looked at the progress of the ten countries set to join the bloc next year .
the commission said the perspective members – especially laggard poland – still had plenty of work to do and all needed to redouble their efforts ahead of accession in may .
poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania , latvia , estonia , cyprus and malta will all become part of the eu next spring .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .

struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "

proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .

the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu . straddling two continents , turkey has long aspired to join the european union .
egged on by the fact that ten countries mostly from former communist east europe will become part of the eu next year , ankara has instituted a number of sweeping political and economic reforms over the past year .
but wednesday ’ s report by the european commission noted although the country had made progress on new laws regarding human rights and other reforms , implementation of the legislation was still spotty .
turkey hopes to win the right to start accession negotiations when eu leaders take stock of the country ’ s progress in december 2004 .
“ the deciding question is whether turkey delivers convincing proof in the next eight to ten months that it has seriously changed , ” eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen told the online service of der spiegel magazine .
“ it will depend on whether the reforms become reality and are not just on paper . ”
but criticism of the reform pace at home was not what riled the turks the most about the report .
instead it was the mention of the difficult issue of cyprus , which will join the eu next year .
specifically , brussels said the failure to reunite the divided island , of which turkey occupies the northern third , could present a “ serious obstacle ” to ankara ’ s bid to become part of the european bloc .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul had made a furious last ditch diplomatic push on tuesday night to keep cyprus out of the report but failed .
cyprus divided turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 to head off plans by the greek-dominated government to make cyprus part of greece , but the turkish part is only recognized by ankara .
after the report ’ s release , ankara took a more conciliatory line .
“ we all want a solution to the cyprus problem .
we will make a great effort to solve the problem before may 1 , 2004 , " gul told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
the united nations has blamed the stalled peace talks on cyprus on the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the row over cyprus has overshadowed the eu ’ s support for the turkish reform process recently accelerated by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
“ some of the reforms carry great political significance as they impinge on sensitive issues in the turkish context , such as freedom of expression , freedom of demonstration , cultural rights and civilian control over the military , ” the report said .
besides addressing a potential turkish candidacy , the eu report on wednesday looked at the progress of the ten countries set to join the bloc next year .
the commission said the perspective members – especially laggard poland – still had plenty of work to do and all needed to redouble their efforts ahead of accession in may .
poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania , latvia , estonia , cyprus and malta will all become part of the eu next spring .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu . straddling two continents , turkey has long aspired to join the european union .
egged on by the fact that ten countries mostly from former communist east europe will become part of the eu next year , ankara has instituted a number of sweeping political and economic reforms over the past year .
but wednesday ’ s report by the european commission noted although the country had made progress on new laws regarding human rights and other reforms , implementation of the legislation was still spotty .
turkey hopes to win the right to start accession negotiations when eu leaders take stock of the country ’ s progress in december 2004 .
“ the deciding question is whether turkey delivers convincing proof in the next eight to ten months that it has seriously changed , ” eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen told the online service of der spiegel magazine .
“ it will depend on whether the reforms become reality and are not just on paper . ”
but criticism of the reform pace at home was not what riled the turks the most about the report .
instead it was the mention of the difficult issue of cyprus , which will join the eu next year .
specifically , brussels said the failure to reunite the divided island , of which turkey occupies the northern third , could present a “ serious obstacle ” to ankara ’ s bid to become part of the european bloc .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul had made a furious last ditch diplomatic push on tuesday night to keep cyprus out of the report but failed .
cyprus divided turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 to head off plans by the greek-dominated government to make cyprus part of greece , but the turkish part is only recognized by ankara .
after the report ’ s release , ankara took a more conciliatory line .
“ we all want a solution to the cyprus problem .
we will make a great effort to solve the problem before may 1 , 2004 , " gul told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
the united nations has blamed the stalled peace talks on cyprus on the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the row over cyprus has overshadowed the eu ’ s support for the turkish reform process recently accelerated by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
“ some of the reforms carry great political significance as they impinge on sensitive issues in the turkish context , such as freedom of expression , freedom of demonstration , cultural rights and civilian control over the military , ” the report said .
besides addressing a potential turkish candidacy , the eu report on wednesday looked at the progress of the ten countries set to join the bloc next year .
the commission said the perspective members – especially laggard poland – still had plenty of work to do and all needed to redouble their efforts ahead of accession in may .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .
the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision on deadly force comes almost a year after german interior minister otto schily and struck agreed on a series of measures to increase flight safety within the framework of germany ’ s anti-terror legislation , which was passed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
next step in anti-terror legislation the first measures in the legislation included the use of armed air marshals on certain routes as well as increased protection of cockpit cabins , such as sealing off cabin doors during flights .
the need for further steps became clear in january of this year when a german student stole a small private plane from frankfurt ’ s main airport .
he then circled the city and threatened to crash the plane into one of the city ’ s high-rise buildings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second anti-terror package presented to german parliament the german parliament debates the passage of a new anti-terror package today .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .
the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision on deadly force comes almost a year after german interior minister otto schily and struck agreed on a series of measures to increase flight safety within the framework of germany ’ s anti-terror legislation , which was passed after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
next step in anti-terror legislation the first measures in the legislation included the use of armed air marshals on certain routes as well as increased protection of cockpit cabins , such as sealing off cabin doors during flights .
the need for further steps became clear in january of this year when a german student stole a small private plane from frankfurt ’ s main airport .

the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu . straddling two continents , turkey has long aspired to join the european union .
egged on by the fact that ten countries mostly from former communist east europe will become part of the eu next year , ankara has instituted a number of sweeping political and economic reforms over the past year .
but wednesday ’ s report by the european commission noted although the country had made progress on new laws regarding human rights and other reforms , implementation of the legislation was still spotty .
turkey hopes to win the right to start accession negotiations when eu leaders take stock of the country ’ s progress in december 2004 .
“ the deciding question is whether turkey delivers convincing proof in the next eight to ten months that it has seriously changed , ” eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen told the online service of der spiegel magazine .
“ it will depend on whether the reforms become reality and are not just on paper . ”
but criticism of the reform pace at home was not what riled the turks the most about the report .
instead it was the mention of the difficult issue of cyprus , which will join the eu next year .
specifically , brussels said the failure to reunite the divided island , of which turkey occupies the northern third , could present a “ serious obstacle ” to ankara ’ s bid to become part of the european bloc .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul had made a furious last ditch diplomatic push on tuesday night to keep cyprus out of the report but failed .
cyprus divided turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 to head off plans by the greek-dominated government to make cyprus part of greece , but the turkish part is only recognized by ankara .
after the report ’ s release , ankara took a more conciliatory line .
“ we all want a solution to the cyprus problem .
we will make a great effort to solve the problem before may 1 , 2004 , " gul told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
the united nations has blamed the stalled peace talks on cyprus on the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the row over cyprus has overshadowed the eu ’ s support for the turkish reform process recently accelerated by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
“ some of the reforms carry great political significance as they impinge on sensitive issues in the turkish context , such as freedom of expression , freedom of demonstration , cultural rights and civilian control over the military , ” the report said .
besides addressing a potential turkish candidacy , the eu report on wednesday looked at the progress of the ten countries set to join the bloc next year .
the commission said the perspective members – especially laggard poland – still had plenty of work to do and all needed to redouble their efforts ahead of accession in may .
poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania , latvia , estonia , cyprus and malta will all become part of the eu next spring .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .

" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu . straddling two continents , turkey has long aspired to join the european union .
egged on by the fact that ten countries mostly from former communist east europe will become part of the eu next year , ankara has instituted a number of sweeping political and economic reforms over the past year .
but wednesday ’ s report by the european commission noted although the country had made progress on new laws regarding human rights and other reforms , implementation of the legislation was still spotty .
turkey hopes to win the right to start accession negotiations when eu leaders take stock of the country ’ s progress in december 2004 .
“ the deciding question is whether turkey delivers convincing proof in the next eight to ten months that it has seriously changed , ” eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen told the online service of der spiegel magazine .
“ it will depend on whether the reforms become reality and are not just on paper . ”
but criticism of the reform pace at home was not what riled the turks the most about the report .
instead it was the mention of the difficult issue of cyprus , which will join the eu next year .
specifically , brussels said the failure to reunite the divided island , of which turkey occupies the northern third , could present a “ serious obstacle ” to ankara ’ s bid to become part of the european bloc .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul had made a furious last ditch diplomatic push on tuesday night to keep cyprus out of the report but failed .
cyprus divided turkey invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 to head off plans by the greek-dominated government to make cyprus part of greece , but the turkish part is only recognized by ankara .
after the report ’ s release , ankara took a more conciliatory line .
“ we all want a solution to the cyprus problem .
we will make a great effort to solve the problem before may 1 , 2004 , " gul told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
the united nations has blamed the stalled peace talks on cyprus on the turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the row over cyprus has overshadowed the eu ’ s support for the turkish reform process recently accelerated by prime minister tayyip erdogan .
“ some of the reforms carry great political significance as they impinge on sensitive issues in the turkish context , such as freedom of expression , freedom of demonstration , cultural rights and civilian control over the military , ” the report said .
besides addressing a potential turkish candidacy , the eu report on wednesday looked at the progress of the ten countries set to join the bloc next year .
the commission said the perspective members – especially laggard poland – still had plenty of work to do and all needed to redouble their efforts ahead of accession in may .
poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , lithuania , latvia , estonia , cyprus and malta will all become part of the eu next spring .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " weapons may only be used in cases in which nothing else works and it is clear that the plane will be used against people , " said volker beck , a leading member of the green party .
" the appropriateness of the means is the key criteria , " he added .
cdu wants constitutional change the decision opens the way for the development of a new draft of the air security law which will eventually be put before parliament .
the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .
the conservative opposition party says that the existing laws only cover military operations in germany in cases of natural disasters and major accidents .
it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision on deadly force comes almost a year after german interior minister otto schily and struck agreed on a series of measures to increase flight safety within the framework of germany ’ s anti-terror legislation , which was passed after the sept .

politicians from the country ’ s governing parties agreed that planes commandeered by terrorists in its airspace can be shot down to avert a disaster once defense minister peter struck gives the order .
deadly force as last resort the coalition agreed that downing a plane would remain a last resort and only be pursued after other options , such as trying to force a landing or firing warning shots , had been exhausted .

the final draft may face stiff opposition from the christian democratic union which disagrees with the coalition ’ s view that no constitutional amendment would be necessary for the new rules to become law .

it argues that a change in the constitution would be required for the air force to act in circumstances such as a terrorist threat .
lack of resources conservative defense experts also doubt whether the law can be put into practice effectively .
they claim that the country ’ s airspace surveillance network is not up-to-date and that budget cuts and a reduction in fighter squadrons may leave highly populated areas exposed in the event of a well-coordinated attack using multiple aircraft .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.11.2003 top general sacked as anti-semitism scandal spreads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigade general reinhard günzel was sacked by defense minister peter struck on tuesday german defense minister peter struck has fired the head of germany ’ s special forces after he voiced support for anti-semitic comments made by conservative mp martin hohmann . the anti-semitism row that has dominated the german press over the past week erupted again in dramatic style on tuesday when a top general in the german army was fired for expressing support for the comments made by martin hohmann , the conservative backbench member of parliament at the center of the storm .
brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .

struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .

a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "

legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

brigadier general reinhard günzel , the head of germany 's prestigious special forces unit , the 1,000-strong elite kommando spezialkräfte -lrb- ksk -rrb- which participates in foreign missions such as afghanistan , was dismissed after writing a letter of support to the mp , praising hohmann ’ s speech in which he compared the actions of jews in the russian revolution with those of the nazis .
the revelations came to light after hohmann appeared on germany 's public television station zdf over the weekend , brandishing the letter from the 59-year-old general günzel and backing away from an apology he made under pressure from opposition colleagues .
" an apology would , i think , be a signal that the facts to which i referred are not correct , " he said .
" but the facts are correct . "
letter of praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the german army 's special forces ksk .
in the letter sent to hohmann by the special forces commander , who had recently returned with his troops after serving in afghanistan , günzel allegedly wrote , " an excellent speech ... of a courage , truth and clarity that you rarely hear or read in our country . "
complaining about a climate in germany in which those expressing nationalistic views were immediately labeled rightwing extremists , günzel added , " you can be sure that you speak for the majority of germans ...
do n't let the accusations from the dominant left camp put you off . "
after consultations with various officials , german defense minister peter struck decided to relieve günzel of his post , a move seen by many in the ruling red-green coalition government as a brave stand against anti-semitism .
damaging to germany and army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck tells the press of his decision on tuesday .
struck told reporters : " this is about a lone , confused general who agreed with an even more confused statement made by a conservative member of parliament . "
he added that günzel ’ s views were not those of the army .
" his remarks damaged the federal republic of germany as well as the german army , " struck said .
" i have decided to relieve him of his command and to dismiss him .
with that , the case is closed for me . "
a spokesman for the defense ministry added , " the removal of a general is a very , very rare occurrence .
i am not sure whether it has ever happened before . "
pressure on merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left want angela merkel to take action .
the defense minister ’ s decision has added strength to the calls from the left for action to be taken by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chief angela merkel to fire hohmann for his comments .
to date , the party has only gone as far as to distance itself from the offending mp and remove him from his position on a parliamentary committee responsible for dealing with reparation claims by holocaust survivors .
he has not been fully dismissed .
the german press has also focused on this angle and is beginning to exert pressure on merkel in scathing editorials .
the daily süddeutsche zeitung said on wednesday , " everything that applies to mr. günzel applies equally to deputy hohmann ...
he should be expelled from the party caucus .
unlike struck , however , cdu chief merkel has not yet summoned up the courage to do this . "
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung added that " the cdu must part company with hohmann and his ilk . "
deidre berger , head of the american jewish committee office in berlin told reporters , " we are certain that the cdu will take the necessary measures to deal with these issues , " and called struck 's action " extremely encouraging . "
jewish leader makes formal complaint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul spiegel , chairman of the central council of jews in germany .
legal action could also be taken against hohmann following complaints made by paul spiegel -lrb- picture -rrb- , president of the central council of jews in germany , and an unnamed private citizen .
proceeding with the complaint , prosecutors in the central german city of fulda opened an investigation on monday , accusing the mp of incitement , slander and disparaging the dead for his comments in the october 3rd speech .
anti-semitic remarks constitute a crime under german law .
in his speech made on the anniversary of german reunification , hohmann argued that germans still shoulder the burden of nazi crimes , but other nations with bloody pasts continue to play the role of " innocent lambs , " citing the french revolution and the prominent role of jews in the 1917 communist revolution in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin hohmann .
" with a certain justification , one could ask in view of the millions killed in the first phase of the revolution about the ' guilt ' of the jews , " hohmann said .
" it would follow the same logic with which the germans are described as a race of perpetrators . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

dame shirley , the council 's former leader , owes westminster £ 37m in surcharges following the " homes for votes " scandal in the 1980s .
the council says it has made a significant breakthrough in its attempt to recover the shortfall owed to local taxpayers .
it says assets - understood to be worth about £ 30m - have been frozen in guernsey , but dame shirley says she has no connection with the money .
she said the council 's investigators had sought to involve off-shore trusts whose principal beneficiaries had no connection to the case .
we are pursuing the full amount from dame shirley porter colin wilson westminster council the council has argued the trusts are a sham designed to disguise her control over the family fortune and therefore is money owed to the council for her financial misconduct .
the council also says a further order has been granted to freeze dame shirley 's assets alleged to be held by her son john porter .
it says this is a step forward but that getting hold of the money will depend upon successful enforcement action .
in the 1990s , the district auditor found dame shirley guilty of squandering millions of pounds by unlawfully selling off council flats on the cheap , simply to boost the number of tory voters .
disclosure orders she was cleared by the court of appeal in 1998 , but in 2001 , the house of lords ruled she did have to pay back the money she claimed she did not have .
the tesco heiress , who now lives in israel , was once said to be the 20th richest woman in europe with an estimated fortune of £ 60m , but last year when she was ordered by a court to disclose her assets , she listed just £ 300,000 worth .
westminster , which has spent about £ 1m pursuing the heiress , said it had decided to ask various courts to lift gagging orders which had previously prevented details of its legal actions being publicised .
colin wilson , head of legal services at westminster council , said the council had been engaged in some " very intense activity " over recent months .
" we have now made substantial progress .
in fact we have obtained disclosure orders against 14 different companies and individuals in the uk , in guernsey and in the british virgin isles , " he told bbc london .
these orders require respondents to disclose information to the council about dame shirley 's past and present wealth .
" we have gained a substantial amount of information from those disclosures and in addition , we have frozen in bank accounts many millions of pounds . "

in the 1990s , the district auditor found dame shirley guilty of squandering millions of pounds by unlawfully selling off council flats on the cheap , simply to boost the number of tory voters .
disclosure orders she was cleared by the court of appeal in 1998 , but in 2001 , the house of lords ruled she did have to pay back the money she claimed she did not have .
the tesco heiress , who now lives in israel , was once said to be the 20th richest woman in europe with an estimated fortune of £ 60m , but last year when she was ordered by a court to disclose her assets , she listed just £ 300,000 worth .
westminster , which has spent about £ 1m pursuing the heiress , said it had decided to ask various courts to lift gagging orders which had previously prevented details of its legal actions being publicised .
colin wilson , head of legal services at westminster council , said the council had been engaged in some " very intense activity " over recent months .
" we have now made substantial progress .
in fact we have obtained disclosure orders against 14 different companies and individuals in the uk , in guernsey and in the british virgin isles , " he told bbc london .
these orders require respondents to disclose information to the council about dame shirley 's past and present wealth .
" we have gained a substantial amount of information from those disclosures and in addition , we have frozen in bank accounts many millions of pounds . "

the united nations-sponsored deal involving azerbaijan , iran , kazakhstan , russia and turkmenistan seeks to reduce the amount of sewage and industrial waste pumped into the sea .
it also ends nearly 10 years of quarrelling over its oil and gas reserves .
in new york , un secretary-general kofi annan hailed the signing as " a significant step forward for the region " .
" by signing this important new treaty the caspian states are demonstrating their firm commitment to saving the beautiful and resource-rich caspian sea , " iranian vice president masoumeh ebtekar said .
world bank deal toxic waste dumping , oil leaks , agricultural run-off , and over-fishing of the caviar-producing sturgeon fish , have all contributed to the caspian 's serious ecological decline .
the sea is soon set to be one end of a pipeline which will transport central asian oil to europe .
the world bank has approved loans of just over $ 300m to help the ongoing construction of the pipeline which will run from an oil field off the coast of azerbaijan , through georgia , to the turkish mediterranean port of ceyhan .
it is said to be the longest of its kind in the world .
engineers have carried out nearly 40 % of the work , and the first crude oil is expected to flow in 2005 .
the world bank has said possible risks of the pipeline to the environment have been addressed .

the jury in the first trial could not agree on a verdict , allowing mr quattrone , once a star at top wall street firm credit suisse first boston -lrb- cfsb -rrb- , to walk free .
at issue was whether mr quattrone had knowingly blocked investigations into so-called " share spinning " .
csfb and its fellow banks have been accused of pushing shares in lucrative dot.com flotations towards favoured clients to secure banking business from them .
e-mails from mr quattrone , prosecutors allege , show he encouraged staff to destroy records despite knowing an investigation into the practice was under way .
his lawyers , unsurprisingly , said the decision to call for a fresh trial was unjustified .
" we are disappointed ... because -lrb- quattrone -rrb- is innocent , " attorney john keker said .
they now have the chance to prepare him better for cross-examination - an area where he came badly unstuck in the first trial .
while on the stand he was forced to contradict himself , admitting to having a hand in allocating such " hot stocks " as amazon and cisco systems when he had formerly denied any involvement .
if found guilty , mr quattrone could have faced a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail , though federal guidelines recommend a lighter sentence .
state and federal prosectors closed an investigation into csfb in 2001 .
the bank paid $ 100m to settle civil charges without admitting wrongdoing .
mr quattrone is said to have made a personal fortune of $ 200m during the dot.com boom .
he resigned from csfb in march 2003 after being suspended when the allegations of email-shredding emerged .

the move is the first in a major economy in months , and could prove the start of a round of hikes worldwide .
the reserve bank of australia said it had put up the cost of loans by a quarter of a percentage point to 5 % , because it feared that households were taking on too much debt .
it also cited the need for pre-emptive action given recent signs of a global economic recovery .
" it is no longer prudent to continue with such an expansionary fiscal stance , " the bank said in a statement .
it said the current rate of growth in consumer borrowing , estimated at 20 % a year , was much faster " than can be expected to be consistent with economic stability over the long run . "
on the hop the rate increase , the first in 17 months , took the financial markets by surprise .
the australian dollar rose against its us counterpart to a fresh six-year high , while the main share price index in sydney closed down 0.7 % .
an interest rate increase had been widely forecast , but most analysts had expected the central bank to hold off for at least another month .
now , though , many fear more rate rises are around the corner .
trend australia has weathered the global downturn better than most other industrialised economies .
growth slowed this year because of drought and the impact of the sars virus , but the decline was partially offset by strong consumer spending , encouraged by a two-year boom in house prices .
the property boom , which is partly to blame for high levels of consumer borrowing , has prompted several warnings from the reserve bank .
the bank of england is widely expected to follow suit on thursday , raising borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.75 % .
as in australia , persistently high levels of consumer debt and surging house prices have reinforced the case for higher interest rates in the uk .

the company , the most profitable carmaker in the world , announced net profits for the six months to september of 524.46bn yen -lrb- $ 4.8bn ; £ 2.8bn -rrb- , with operating profit - a key measure of ongoing health - up 12 % .
sales grew 8 % over the previous year to 8.2 trillion yen , despite a disappointing performance in the april-june quarter .
toyota also said it expected its performance to improve over the full year , despite the effect of the weakening dollar which could hurt its earnings in the us .
" following on from last year , we are aiming for record profits on every level , " toyota executive takeshi suzuki told a press conference .
unlike its us rivals , toyota has been adding sales in all its key markets around the world .
its success has been particularly marked in the us , where earlier this year it overtook chrysler to become the third biggest-selling marque .
its market share there is at 11.2 % so far this year , against 10.4 % in 2002 as a whole .
currency concerns but there remains the risk of the dollar , analysts said , which has fallen as much as 10 yen in recent months .
as much as 25bn yen could be wiped off operating profits for every yen fall in the us dollar 's value , some believe .
and the trend towards heavy incentives in the us market is also a concern .
ever since the post-9/11 slump in consumer spending , carmakers have been boosting sales through heavy discounting and zero-interest financing deals .
these have eaten into the bottom line at the us big three - ford , gm and chrysler .
a slowing of sales in october as new models arrived without the same levels of incentives seems to indicate us consumers now view the deals as the norm , not the exception .

and the trend towards heavy incentives in the us market is also a concern .
ever since the post-9/11 slump in consumer spending , carmakers have been boosting sales through heavy discounting and zero-interest financing deals .
these have eaten into the bottom line at the us big three - ford , gm and chrysler .
a slowing of sales in october as new models arrived without the same levels of incentives seems to indicate us consumers now view the deals as the norm , not the exception .

fears that hedgehogs could die after hibernating in bonfires are being made by wildlife groups across wales .
the deeside urban wildlife group -lrb- duwg -rrb- advises that people should build bonfire night fires teepee-style , so they can easily check for hedgehogs shortly before lighting them .
the south and west wales wildlife trust is also concerned about the effect of burning the wrong kind of materials on bonfires .
it recommends that only clean wood and plant vegetation should be burned - not potentially noxious materials like tyres , painted wood , or plastic .
the trust urges that these items , and other household waste should be disposed of at council waste depots .
hedgehogs are particularly at risk on bonfire night because they are preparing for their annual winter sleep at this time of year , and bonfires provide ideal nesting sites .
clare christian , duwg community wildlife officer sad : " hedgehogs hibernate during the winter months , from november to march , under hedges , sheds and piles of dead leaves and sticks .
" a bonfire will be very inviting in this cold , wet weather . "
she said that a teepee-style bonfire could be filled just before being lit , after checking with a torch to see if any hedgehogs have crawled inside .
hedgehogs are protected under the wildlife and countryside act .
they are seen to be of great value to gardeners because they naturally control populations of slugs and snails .
but mike whitley , denbighshire 's biodiversity officer , said hedgehog numbers were dropping .
" population decline is possibly due to increased road development and loss of habitat such as scrub and hedgerow , " he said .
" another possible factor in their decline is garden ponds which have no shelf for animals to crawl out on , as well as the use of garden pesticides and herbicides which destroy the food chain . "

the event is expected to be told how manchester 's population fell by 53 % between 1951 and 1981 , and liverpool 's by 55 % .
the project is also looking at urban regions in the united states , russia and germany .
the workshop will also examine how the recent renaissance in popular culture , city branding and urban regeneration has helped to stem that loss of population .
during the ' 80s and ' 90s , the reductions in the north west cities were less exaggerated , but remained steady for both cities at 15 % .
results of the project will be presented at a series of international exhibitions in berlin , moscow and then liverpool and manchester during 2004/5 .
of particular interest will be the effect of liverpool being named european city of culture for 2008 .
