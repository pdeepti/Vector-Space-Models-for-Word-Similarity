german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .
the hospital was sealed off after a tip-off . german authorities said wednesday they had received information that islamic terrorists were planning suicide car bomb attacks in early 2004 in hamburg and frankfurt .
" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .
german interior minister otto schily on wednesday confirmed that the tip-off had come from the u.s. central intelligence agency .
hamburg constitution protection chief heino vahldiek said u.s. intelligence sources had identified two terror suspects .
no explosives have been found in hamburg .
fears of u.s. targets the incident comes amid heightened global security fears after u.s. authorities raised their security alert to the second highest level due to signs of a possible attack by al qaeda , blamed by washington for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .
fears are growing that europe could have become a recruiting ground for islamists seeking to attack u.s. targets .
a spokesman at the hamburg military hospital said no u.s. soldiers were currently being treated there , but said american soldiers injured in iraq had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past .
a spokesman at the u.s. military hospital in frankfurt said they there was no current terror threat .
security arrangements hadn ’ t been tightened at the airport .
terror group with alleged ties to al qaeda nockemann said the terror suspects were connected to the ansar al-islam group , which washington believes is active in fighting its troops in iraq and has ties to al qaeda .
german security authorities suspect ansar al-islam of smuggling in islamists prepared for violence into germany and bringing potential suicide bombers to iraq .
the bavarian constitutional protection report states that the group has about 100 active members , with cells in munich , augsburg and nuremberg .
the outfit allegedly consists of up to 1,000 radical kurds from northern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar , kurdish leader of the iraq-based islamic fundamentalist group ansar al-islam .
ansar al-islam leader mullah krekar -lrb- photo -rrb- is reported to personally know osama bin laden and is said to view him as " the crown on the heads of muslims . "
according to the constitutional protection report , ansar al-islam wants to fight christians and muslims and wants to religiously prepare itself with weapons and money for the " holy war . "
krekar , who lives in norway , allegedly collected donations during his visits to germany and lobbied for his radical group .
military airport cordoned off in a massive security operation on tuesday , about 100 police officers sealed off the military hospital .
troops deployed two armored vehicles , cordoned off surrounding streets and searched parked cars .
around 2,000 neighborhood residents were required to show identification before entering or leaving their apartments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police search passers-by near the military hospital in hamburg .
though the normal routine continued at the military hospital , where civilians are also treated , patients and hospital staff also had to undergo security checks on tuesday .
the security measures around the building remained in place on wednesday .
a police spokesman said passing cars and pedestrians would have to reckon with search controls .
schily blasts " premature " police action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily meanwhile , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- strongly criticized the police operation in hamburg and said the premature leaking of suspected terrorism targets would endanger the hunt for the terrorists .
" it ’ s regrettable that the hints made it out in the public so prematurely because that could make the successful clarification of the case more difficult , " schily said in berlin .
hamburg security authorities defended the move .
vahldiek said in a television interview that the concrete nature of the tips led authorities to take them seriously .
" both the federal and state branches of the german agency for internal security informed us in writing about the concrete risk of a terror attack , " dirk nockemann , said in a statement .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .

the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .

concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2003 experts skeptical of german tax amnesty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax amnesty is hoped to tempt stashed away money back into state coffers .
new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .

" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .

concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .
supported by 150 marine personnel in kenya as well as reconnaissance planes and a fleet of ships , they are responsible for keeping shipping routes free and monitoring suspicious vessels supplying suspected terrorist groups .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2003 experts skeptical of german tax amnesty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax amnesty is hoped to tempt stashed away money back into state coffers .
new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .

german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .
the hospital was sealed off after a tip-off . german authorities said wednesday they had received information that islamic terrorists were planning suicide car bomb attacks in early 2004 in hamburg and frankfurt .
" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .
german interior minister otto schily on wednesday confirmed that the tip-off had come from the u.s. central intelligence agency .
hamburg constitution protection chief heino vahldiek said u.s. intelligence sources had identified two terror suspects .
no explosives have been found in hamburg .
fears of u.s. targets the incident comes amid heightened global security fears after u.s. authorities raised their security alert to the second highest level due to signs of a possible attack by al qaeda , blamed by washington for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .
fears are growing that europe could have become a recruiting ground for islamists seeking to attack u.s. targets .
a spokesman at the hamburg military hospital said no u.s. soldiers were currently being treated there , but said american soldiers injured in iraq had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past .
a spokesman at the u.s. military hospital in frankfurt said they there was no current terror threat .
security arrangements hadn ’ t been tightened at the airport .
terror group with alleged ties to al qaeda nockemann said the terror suspects were connected to the ansar al-islam group , which washington believes is active in fighting its troops in iraq and has ties to al qaeda .
german security authorities suspect ansar al-islam of smuggling in islamists prepared for violence into germany and bringing potential suicide bombers to iraq .
the bavarian constitutional protection report states that the group has about 100 active members , with cells in munich , augsburg and nuremberg .
the outfit allegedly consists of up to 1,000 radical kurds from northern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar , kurdish leader of the iraq-based islamic fundamentalist group ansar al-islam .
ansar al-islam leader mullah krekar -lrb- photo -rrb- is reported to personally know osama bin laden and is said to view him as " the crown on the heads of muslims . "
according to the constitutional protection report , ansar al-islam wants to fight christians and muslims and wants to religiously prepare itself with weapons and money for the " holy war . "
krekar , who lives in norway , allegedly collected donations during his visits to germany and lobbied for his radical group .
military airport cordoned off in a massive security operation on tuesday , about 100 police officers sealed off the military hospital .
troops deployed two armored vehicles , cordoned off surrounding streets and searched parked cars .
around 2,000 neighborhood residents were required to show identification before entering or leaving their apartments .

though the normal routine continued at the military hospital , where civilians are also treated , patients and hospital staff also had to undergo security checks on tuesday .
the security measures around the building remained in place on wednesday .
a police spokesman said passing cars and pedestrians would have to reckon with search controls .
schily blasts " premature " police action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily meanwhile , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- strongly criticized the police operation in hamburg and said the premature leaking of suspected terrorism targets would endanger the hunt for the terrorists .
" it ’ s regrettable that the hints made it out in the public so prematurely because that could make the successful clarification of the case more difficult , " schily said in berlin .
hamburg security authorities defended the move .
vahldiek said in a television interview that the concrete nature of the tips led authorities to take them seriously .
" both the federal and state branches of the german agency for internal security informed us in writing about the concrete risk of a terror attack , " dirk nockemann , said in a statement .

virtually unknown in the english-speaking world , the british sketch has been aired on german tv for 40 years . not usually inclined to watch movies in their original language , germans make one exception for " dinner for one . "
granted , there ’ s not much of a dialogue to follow , as the 15-minute , black-and-white sketch - also known as " the 90th birthday " - mainly consists of a butler ’ s drunken babbling .
“ dinner for one ” originated in british cabarets in the 1920s and was filmed for german public television in hamburg in 1963 .
the story goes as follows : miss sophie has invited her four best friends to celebrate her 90th birthday .
since all of them are already dead , her butler james impersonates the quartet and toasts the birthday girl in lieu of them and gets helplessly drunk as the evening wears on : james : happy new year , sophie gal ...

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .
they have removed not only their capital , but also themselves out of their native germany and now reside in switzerland . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves sweeping economic reforms germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .

german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .
the hospital was sealed off after a tip-off . german authorities said wednesday they had received information that islamic terrorists were planning suicide car bomb attacks in early 2004 in hamburg and frankfurt .
" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .
german interior minister otto schily on wednesday confirmed that the tip-off had come from the u.s. central intelligence agency .
hamburg constitution protection chief heino vahldiek said u.s. intelligence sources had identified two terror suspects .
no explosives have been found in hamburg .
fears of u.s. targets the incident comes amid heightened global security fears after u.s. authorities raised their security alert to the second highest level due to signs of a possible attack by al qaeda , blamed by washington for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .
fears are growing that europe could have become a recruiting ground for islamists seeking to attack u.s. targets .
a spokesman at the hamburg military hospital said no u.s. soldiers were currently being treated there , but said american soldiers injured in iraq had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past .
a spokesman at the u.s. military hospital in frankfurt said they there was no current terror threat .
security arrangements hadn ’ t been tightened at the airport .
terror group with alleged ties to al qaeda nockemann said the terror suspects were connected to the ansar al-islam group , which washington believes is active in fighting its troops in iraq and has ties to al qaeda .
german security authorities suspect ansar al-islam of smuggling in islamists prepared for violence into germany and bringing potential suicide bombers to iraq .
the bavarian constitutional protection report states that the group has about 100 active members , with cells in munich , augsburg and nuremberg .
the outfit allegedly consists of up to 1,000 radical kurds from northern iraq .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan both germany and france have been supporting mediation attempts by the neighboring chad government between the dafur rebels and the sudanese government .
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan said recently the situation in sudan was " alarming " and said close to a million people were affected by " a rapid worsening of the humanitarian situation . "
concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .
supported by 150 marine personnel in kenya as well as reconnaissance planes and a fleet of ships , they are responsible for keeping shipping routes free and monitoring suspicious vessels supplying suspected terrorist groups .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan both germany and france have been supporting mediation attempts by the neighboring chad government between the dafur rebels and the sudanese government .
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan said recently the situation in sudan was " alarming " and said close to a million people were affected by " a rapid worsening of the humanitarian situation . "
concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .
supported by 150 marine personnel in kenya as well as reconnaissance planes and a fleet of ships , they are responsible for keeping shipping routes free and monitoring suspicious vessels supplying suspected terrorist groups .

but i assure you that we are trying to spread the burden equally . ” shopping for germany a billion euro tax cut approved just weeks ago will be another way to spur job growth and kick-start the economy , schröder said , reminding germans that they should help along this process by spending more money . “ you personally can be a motor of economic growth , ” schröder said .
“ your confidence in the future can play a role in saving your neighbor ’ s job . ” combating health care fraud personal responsibility is also the key word in reforming germany ’ s health care sector to lower labor costs , according to the chancellor .
starting thursday , germans will have to pay additional fees for doctor ’ s visits , medication and hospital stays , among others . while his social democratic and green government is committed to ensuring universal access to health care regardless of income , schröder said germans should also help to reduce health care costs by avoiding unnecessary treatments . “ wastefulness , exploitation and fraud in the health sector harms us all , ” he said . creating a child-friendly environment referring to germany ’ s drop in education standards , schröder said that federal and state governments would work together to mend the problems .
he added that billions are being spent to expand child-care facilities . “ we want that more women dare to have children , that young people can manage to have both a family and a career , ” he said and asked his fellow citizens to help encourage a child-friendly environment . germans should not just expect politicians to bring about change , though .
“ a welcoming attitude towards children begins in the workplace and in your own neighborhood , ” schröder said . he added that not only germans would gain from further reforms in the coming year .
“ if germany undergoes a decisive and cohesive modernization , not only our country will benefit , ” he said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder in his annual new year ’ s speech called on germans to do their part in bringing the country ’ s ailing economy back on track . thanking his countrymen for their willingness to quickly help the victims of friday ’ s earthquake in iran , schröder said that only an economically strong germany could continue to take on its global responsibilities . a social welfare and labor market reform package recently passed by parliament was one way to bring germany back from economic stagnation , the chancellor said . “ for some of you , these measures will cause limitations or cutbacks , ” he said .
“ we know that .
but i assure you that we are trying to spread the burden equally . ” shopping for germany a billion euro tax cut approved just weeks ago will be another way to spur job growth and kick-start the economy , schröder said , reminding germans that they should help along this process by spending more money . “ you personally can be a motor of economic growth , ” schröder said .
“ your confidence in the future can play a role in saving your neighbor ’ s job . ” combating health care fraud personal responsibility is also the key word in reforming germany ’ s health care sector to lower labor costs , according to the chancellor .
starting thursday , germans will have to pay additional fees for doctor ’ s visits , medication and hospital stays , among others . while his social democratic and green government is committed to ensuring universal access to health care regardless of income , schröder said germans should also help to reduce health care costs by avoiding unnecessary treatments . “ wastefulness , exploitation and fraud in the health sector harms us all , ” he said . creating a child-friendly environment referring to germany ’ s drop in education standards , schröder said that federal and state governments would work together to mend the problems .
he added that billions are being spent to expand child-care facilities . “ we want that more women dare to have children , that young people can manage to have both a family and a career , ” he said and asked his fellow citizens to help encourage a child-friendly environment . germans should not just expect politicians to bring about change , though .
“ a welcoming attitude towards children begins in the workplace and in your own neighborhood , ” schröder said . he added that not only germans would gain from further reforms in the coming year .
“ if germany undergoes a decisive and cohesive modernization , not only our country will benefit , ” he said .

" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .

three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .

german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .
the hospital was sealed off after a tip-off . german authorities said wednesday they had received information that islamic terrorists were planning suicide car bomb attacks in early 2004 in hamburg and frankfurt .
" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .
german interior minister otto schily on wednesday confirmed that the tip-off had come from the u.s. central intelligence agency .
hamburg constitution protection chief heino vahldiek said u.s. intelligence sources had identified two terror suspects .
no explosives have been found in hamburg .
fears of u.s. targets the incident comes amid heightened global security fears after u.s. authorities raised their security alert to the second highest level due to signs of a possible attack by al qaeda , blamed by washington for the sept .

three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .
fears are growing that europe could have become a recruiting ground for islamists seeking to attack u.s. targets .
a spokesman at the hamburg military hospital said no u.s. soldiers were currently being treated there , but said american soldiers injured in iraq had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past .
a spokesman at the u.s. military hospital in frankfurt said they there was no current terror threat .
security arrangements hadn ’ t been tightened at the airport .
terror group with alleged ties to al qaeda nockemann said the terror suspects were connected to the ansar al-islam group , which washington believes is active in fighting its troops in iraq and has ties to al qaeda .
german security authorities suspect ansar al-islam of smuggling in islamists prepared for violence into germany and bringing potential suicide bombers to iraq .
the bavarian constitutional protection report states that the group has about 100 active members , with cells in munich , augsburg and nuremberg .
the outfit allegedly consists of up to 1,000 radical kurds from northern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar , kurdish leader of the iraq-based islamic fundamentalist group ansar al-islam .
ansar al-islam leader mullah krekar -lrb- photo -rrb- is reported to personally know osama bin laden and is said to view him as " the crown on the heads of muslims . "
according to the constitutional protection report , ansar al-islam wants to fight christians and muslims and wants to religiously prepare itself with weapons and money for the " holy war . "
krekar , who lives in norway , allegedly collected donations during his visits to germany and lobbied for his radical group .
military airport cordoned off in a massive security operation on tuesday , about 100 police officers sealed off the military hospital .
troops deployed two armored vehicles , cordoned off surrounding streets and searched parked cars .
around 2,000 neighborhood residents were required to show identification before entering or leaving their apartments .

though the normal routine continued at the military hospital , where civilians are also treated , patients and hospital staff also had to undergo security checks on tuesday .

a police spokesman said passing cars and pedestrians would have to reckon with search controls .
schily blasts " premature " police action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily meanwhile , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- strongly criticized the police operation in hamburg and said the premature leaking of suspected terrorism targets would endanger the hunt for the terrorists .
" it ’ s regrettable that the hints made it out in the public so prematurely because that could make the successful clarification of the case more difficult , " schily said in berlin .
hamburg security authorities defended the move .
vahldiek said in a television interview that the concrete nature of the tips led authorities to take them seriously .
" both the federal and state branches of the german agency for internal security informed us in writing about the concrete risk of a terror attack , " dirk nockemann , said in a statement .

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "

the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .

eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2003 experts skeptical of german tax amnesty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax amnesty is hoped to tempt stashed away money back into state coffers .
new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan both germany and france have been supporting mediation attempts by the neighboring chad government between the dafur rebels and the sudanese government .
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan said recently the situation in sudan was " alarming " and said close to a million people were affected by " a rapid worsening of the humanitarian situation . "
concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .
supported by 150 marine personnel in kenya as well as reconnaissance planes and a fleet of ships , they are responsible for keeping shipping routes free and monitoring suspicious vessels supplying suspected terrorist groups .

virtually unknown in the english-speaking world , the british sketch has been aired on german tv for 40 years . not usually inclined to watch movies in their original language , germans make one exception for " dinner for one . "
granted , there ’ s not much of a dialogue to follow , as the 15-minute , black-and-white sketch - also known as " the 90th birthday " - mainly consists of a butler ’ s drunken babbling .
“ dinner for one ” originated in british cabarets in the 1920s and was filmed for german public television in hamburg in 1963 .
the story goes as follows : miss sophie has invited her four best friends to celebrate her 90th birthday .
since all of them are already dead , her butler james impersonates the quartet and toasts the birthday girl in lieu of them and gets helplessly drunk as the evening wears on : james : happy new year , sophie gal ...

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan both germany and france have been supporting mediation attempts by the neighboring chad government between the dafur rebels and the sudanese government .
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan said recently the situation in sudan was " alarming " and said close to a million people were affected by " a rapid worsening of the humanitarian situation . "
concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .
supported by 150 marine personnel in kenya as well as reconnaissance planes and a fleet of ships , they are responsible for keeping shipping routes free and monitoring suspicious vessels supplying suspected terrorist groups .
in november this year , the german parliament extended by a year the mandate for 3,100 soldiers working in africa , afghanistan and kuwait as part of " operation enduring freedom .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?

the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .

concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .

hamburg security authorities defended the move .
vahldiek said in a television interview that the concrete nature of the tips led authorities to take them seriously .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan both germany and france have been supporting mediation attempts by the neighboring chad government between the dafur rebels and the sudanese government .
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan said recently the situation in sudan was " alarming " and said close to a million people were affected by " a rapid worsening of the humanitarian situation . "
concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan both germany and france have been supporting mediation attempts by the neighboring chad government between the dafur rebels and the sudanese government .
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan said recently the situation in sudan was " alarming " and said close to a million people were affected by " a rapid worsening of the humanitarian situation . "
concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .

but i assure you that we are trying to spread the burden equally . ” shopping for germany a billion euro tax cut approved just weeks ago will be another way to spur job growth and kick-start the economy , schröder said , reminding germans that they should help along this process by spending more money . “ you personally can be a motor of economic growth , ” schröder said .
“ your confidence in the future can play a role in saving your neighbor ’ s job . ” combating health care fraud personal responsibility is also the key word in reforming germany ’ s health care sector to lower labor costs , according to the chancellor .
starting thursday , germans will have to pay additional fees for doctor ’ s visits , medication and hospital stays , among others . while his social democratic and green government is committed to ensuring universal access to health care regardless of income , schröder said germans should also help to reduce health care costs by avoiding unnecessary treatments . “ wastefulness , exploitation and fraud in the health sector harms us all , ” he said . creating a child-friendly environment referring to germany ’ s drop in education standards , schröder said that federal and state governments would work together to mend the problems .
he added that billions are being spent to expand child-care facilities . “ we want that more women dare to have children , that young people can manage to have both a family and a career , ” he said and asked his fellow citizens to help encourage a child-friendly environment . germans should not just expect politicians to bring about change , though .
“ a welcoming attitude towards children begins in the workplace and in your own neighborhood , ” schröder said . he added that not only germans would gain from further reforms in the coming year .
“ if germany undergoes a decisive and cohesive modernization , not only our country will benefit , ” he said .

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .

german chancellor gerhard schröder in his annual new year ’ s speech called on germans to do their part in bringing the country ’ s ailing economy back on track . thanking his countrymen for their willingness to quickly help the victims of friday ’ s earthquake in iran , schröder said that only an economically strong germany could continue to take on its global responsibilities . a social welfare and labor market reform package recently passed by parliament was one way to bring germany back from economic stagnation , the chancellor said . “ for some of you , these measures will cause limitations or cutbacks , ” he said .
“ we know that .
but i assure you that we are trying to spread the burden equally . ” shopping for germany a billion euro tax cut approved just weeks ago will be another way to spur job growth and kick-start the economy , schröder said , reminding germans that they should help along this process by spending more money . “ you personally can be a motor of economic growth , ” schröder said .
“ your confidence in the future can play a role in saving your neighbor ’ s job . ” combating health care fraud personal responsibility is also the key word in reforming germany ’ s health care sector to lower labor costs , according to the chancellor .
starting thursday , germans will have to pay additional fees for doctor ’ s visits , medication and hospital stays , among others . while his social democratic and green government is committed to ensuring universal access to health care regardless of income , schröder said germans should also help to reduce health care costs by avoiding unnecessary treatments . “ wastefulness , exploitation and fraud in the health sector harms us all , ” he said . creating a child-friendly environment referring to germany ’ s drop in education standards , schröder said that federal and state governments would work together to mend the problems .
he added that billions are being spent to expand child-care facilities . “ we want that more women dare to have children , that young people can manage to have both a family and a career , ” he said and asked his fellow citizens to help encourage a child-friendly environment . germans should not just expect politicians to bring about change , though .
“ a welcoming attitude towards children begins in the workplace and in your own neighborhood , ” schröder said . he added that not only germans would gain from further reforms in the coming year .

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .

german chancellor gerhard schröder in his annual new year ’ s speech called on germans to do their part in bringing the country ’ s ailing economy back on track . thanking his countrymen for their willingness to quickly help the victims of friday ’ s earthquake in iran , schröder said that only an economically strong germany could continue to take on its global responsibilities . a social welfare and labor market reform package recently passed by parliament was one way to bring germany back from economic stagnation , the chancellor said . “ for some of you , these measures will cause limitations or cutbacks , ” he said .
“ we know that .
but i assure you that we are trying to spread the burden equally . ” shopping for germany a billion euro tax cut approved just weeks ago will be another way to spur job growth and kick-start the economy , schröder said , reminding germans that they should help along this process by spending more money . “ you personally can be a motor of economic growth , ” schröder said .
“ your confidence in the future can play a role in saving your neighbor ’ s job . ” combating health care fraud personal responsibility is also the key word in reforming germany ’ s health care sector to lower labor costs , according to the chancellor .
starting thursday , germans will have to pay additional fees for doctor ’ s visits , medication and hospital stays , among others . while his social democratic and green government is committed to ensuring universal access to health care regardless of income , schröder said germans should also help to reduce health care costs by avoiding unnecessary treatments . “ wastefulness , exploitation and fraud in the health sector harms us all , ” he said . creating a child-friendly environment referring to germany ’ s drop in education standards , schröder said that federal and state governments would work together to mend the problems .
he added that billions are being spent to expand child-care facilities . “ we want that more women dare to have children , that young people can manage to have both a family and a career , ” he said and asked his fellow citizens to help encourage a child-friendly environment . germans should not just expect politicians to bring about change , though .
“ a welcoming attitude towards children begins in the workplace and in your own neighborhood , ” schröder said . he added that not only germans would gain from further reforms in the coming year .
“ if germany undergoes a decisive and cohesive modernization , not only our country will benefit , ” he said .

virtually unknown in the english-speaking world , the british sketch has been aired on german tv for 40 years . not usually inclined to watch movies in their original language , germans make one exception for " dinner for one . "

“ dinner for one ” originated in british cabarets in the 1920s and was filmed for german public television in hamburg in 1963 .
the story goes as follows : miss sophie has invited her four best friends to celebrate her 90th birthday .

german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .
the hospital was sealed off after a tip-off . german authorities said wednesday they had received information that islamic terrorists were planning suicide car bomb attacks in early 2004 in hamburg and frankfurt .
" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .
german interior minister otto schily on wednesday confirmed that the tip-off had come from the u.s. central intelligence agency .
hamburg constitution protection chief heino vahldiek said u.s. intelligence sources had identified two terror suspects .
no explosives have been found in hamburg .
fears of u.s. targets the incident comes amid heightened global security fears after u.s. authorities raised their security alert to the second highest level due to signs of a possible attack by al qaeda , blamed by washington for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .
fears are growing that europe could have become a recruiting ground for islamists seeking to attack u.s. targets .
a spokesman at the hamburg military hospital said no u.s. soldiers were currently being treated there , but said american soldiers injured in iraq had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past .
a spokesman at the u.s. military hospital in frankfurt said they there was no current terror threat .
security arrangements hadn ’ t been tightened at the airport .
terror group with alleged ties to al qaeda nockemann said the terror suspects were connected to the ansar al-islam group , which washington believes is active in fighting its troops in iraq and has ties to al qaeda .
german security authorities suspect ansar al-islam of smuggling in islamists prepared for violence into germany and bringing potential suicide bombers to iraq .
the bavarian constitutional protection report states that the group has about 100 active members , with cells in munich , augsburg and nuremberg .
the outfit allegedly consists of up to 1,000 radical kurds from northern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar , kurdish leader of the iraq-based islamic fundamentalist group ansar al-islam .
ansar al-islam leader mullah krekar -lrb- photo -rrb- is reported to personally know osama bin laden and is said to view him as " the crown on the heads of muslims . "
according to the constitutional protection report , ansar al-islam wants to fight christians and muslims and wants to religiously prepare itself with weapons and money for the " holy war . "
krekar , who lives in norway , allegedly collected donations during his visits to germany and lobbied for his radical group .
military airport cordoned off in a massive security operation on tuesday , about 100 police officers sealed off the military hospital .
troops deployed two armored vehicles , cordoned off surrounding streets and searched parked cars .
around 2,000 neighborhood residents were required to show identification before entering or leaving their apartments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police search passers-by near the military hospital in hamburg .
though the normal routine continued at the military hospital , where civilians are also treated , patients and hospital staff also had to undergo security checks on tuesday .
the security measures around the building remained in place on wednesday .
a police spokesman said passing cars and pedestrians would have to reckon with search controls .
schily blasts " premature " police action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily meanwhile , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- strongly criticized the police operation in hamburg and said the premature leaking of suspected terrorism targets would endanger the hunt for the terrorists .
" it ’ s regrettable that the hints made it out in the public so prematurely because that could make the successful clarification of the case more difficult , " schily said in berlin .
hamburg security authorities defended the move .
vahldiek said in a television interview that the concrete nature of the tips led authorities to take them seriously .
" both the federal and state branches of the german agency for internal security informed us in writing about the concrete risk of a terror attack , " dirk nockemann , said in a statement .

" it ’ s regrettable that the hints made it out in the public so prematurely because that could make the successful clarification of the case more difficult , " schily said in berlin .
hamburg security authorities defended the move .
vahldiek said in a television interview that the concrete nature of the tips led authorities to take them seriously .
" both the federal and state branches of the german agency for internal security informed us in writing about the concrete risk of a terror attack , " dirk nockemann , said in a statement .

german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .
the hospital was sealed off after a tip-off . german authorities said wednesday they had received information that islamic terrorists were planning suicide car bomb attacks in early 2004 in hamburg and frankfurt .
" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .
german interior minister otto schily on wednesday confirmed that the tip-off had come from the u.s. central intelligence agency .
hamburg constitution protection chief heino vahldiek said u.s. intelligence sources had identified two terror suspects .
no explosives have been found in hamburg .
fears of u.s. targets the incident comes amid heightened global security fears after u.s. authorities raised their security alert to the second highest level due to signs of a possible attack by al qaeda , blamed by washington for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .
fears are growing that europe could have become a recruiting ground for islamists seeking to attack u.s. targets .
a spokesman at the hamburg military hospital said no u.s. soldiers were currently being treated there , but said american soldiers injured in iraq had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past .
a spokesman at the u.s. military hospital in frankfurt said they there was no current terror threat .
security arrangements hadn ’ t been tightened at the airport .
terror group with alleged ties to al qaeda nockemann said the terror suspects were connected to the ansar al-islam group , which washington believes is active in fighting its troops in iraq and has ties to al qaeda .
german security authorities suspect ansar al-islam of smuggling in islamists prepared for violence into germany and bringing potential suicide bombers to iraq .
the bavarian constitutional protection report states that the group has about 100 active members , with cells in munich , augsburg and nuremberg .
the outfit allegedly consists of up to 1,000 radical kurds from northern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar , kurdish leader of the iraq-based islamic fundamentalist group ansar al-islam .
ansar al-islam leader mullah krekar -lrb- photo -rrb- is reported to personally know osama bin laden and is said to view him as " the crown on the heads of muslims . "
according to the constitutional protection report , ansar al-islam wants to fight christians and muslims and wants to religiously prepare itself with weapons and money for the " holy war . "
krekar , who lives in norway , allegedly collected donations during his visits to germany and lobbied for his radical group .
military airport cordoned off in a massive security operation on tuesday , about 100 police officers sealed off the military hospital .
troops deployed two armored vehicles , cordoned off surrounding streets and searched parked cars .
around 2,000 neighborhood residents were required to show identification before entering or leaving their apartments .

ask germans about their new year ’ s eve traditions and they ’ re likely to mention “ dinner for one . "
virtually unknown in the english-speaking world , the british sketch has been aired on german tv for 40 years . not usually inclined to watch movies in their original language , germans make one exception for " dinner for one . "
granted , there ’ s not much of a dialogue to follow , as the 15-minute , black-and-white sketch - also known as " the 90th birthday " - mainly consists of a butler ’ s drunken babbling .
“ dinner for one ” originated in british cabarets in the 1920s and was filmed for german public television in hamburg in 1963 .
the story goes as follows : miss sophie has invited her four best friends to celebrate her 90th birthday .
since all of them are already dead , her butler james impersonates the quartet and toasts the birthday girl in lieu of them and gets helplessly drunk as the evening wears on : james : happy new year , sophie gal ...

german police are searching for islamic militants alleged to have planned car bomb attacks on a military hospital in hamburg and a u.s. army airport in frankfurt .
the hospital was sealed off after a tip-off . german authorities said wednesday they had received information that islamic terrorists were planning suicide car bomb attacks in early 2004 in hamburg and frankfurt .
" we have firm indications pointing to individuals planning an attack on the hospital with a car bomb , " a police spokesman told reuters , adding that the suspects were believed to come from the " islamic terrorist scene . "
hamburg state interior minister dirk nockemann said their targets included the military hospital in frankfurt and a u.s. military airport in frankfurt .
german interior minister otto schily on wednesday confirmed that the tip-off had come from the u.s. central intelligence agency .
hamburg constitution protection chief heino vahldiek said u.s. intelligence sources had identified two terror suspects .
no explosives have been found in hamburg .
fears of u.s. targets the incident comes amid heightened global security fears after u.s. authorities raised their security alert to the second highest level due to signs of a possible attack by al qaeda , blamed by washington for the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .
fears are growing that europe could have become a recruiting ground for islamists seeking to attack u.s. targets .
a spokesman at the hamburg military hospital said no u.s. soldiers were currently being treated there , but said american soldiers injured in iraq had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past .
a spokesman at the u.s. military hospital in frankfurt said they there was no current terror threat .
security arrangements hadn ’ t been tightened at the airport .
terror group with alleged ties to al qaeda nockemann said the terror suspects were connected to the ansar al-islam group , which washington believes is active in fighting its troops in iraq and has ties to al qaeda .
german security authorities suspect ansar al-islam of smuggling in islamists prepared for violence into germany and bringing potential suicide bombers to iraq .
the bavarian constitutional protection report states that the group has about 100 active members , with cells in munich , augsburg and nuremberg .
the outfit allegedly consists of up to 1,000 radical kurds from northern iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mullah krekar , kurdish leader of the iraq-based islamic fundamentalist group ansar al-islam .
ansar al-islam leader mullah krekar -lrb- photo -rrb- is reported to personally know osama bin laden and is said to view him as " the crown on the heads of muslims . "
according to the constitutional protection report , ansar al-islam wants to fight christians and muslims and wants to religiously prepare itself with weapons and money for the " holy war . "
krekar , who lives in norway , allegedly collected donations during his visits to germany and lobbied for his radical group .
military airport cordoned off in a massive security operation on tuesday , about 100 police officers sealed off the military hospital .
troops deployed two armored vehicles , cordoned off surrounding streets and searched parked cars .
around 2,000 neighborhood residents were required to show identification before entering or leaving their apartments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police search passers-by near the military hospital in hamburg .
though the normal routine continued at the military hospital , where civilians are also treated , patients and hospital staff also had to undergo security checks on tuesday .
the security measures around the building remained in place on wednesday .
a police spokesman said passing cars and pedestrians would have to reckon with search controls .
schily blasts " premature " police action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily meanwhile , german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- strongly criticized the police operation in hamburg and said the premature leaking of suspected terrorism targets would endanger the hunt for the terrorists .
" it ’ s regrettable that the hints made it out in the public so prematurely because that could make the successful clarification of the case more difficult , " schily said in berlin .
hamburg security authorities defended the move .
vahldiek said in a television interview that the concrete nature of the tips led authorities to take them seriously .
" both the federal and state branches of the german agency for internal security informed us in writing about the concrete risk of a terror attack , " dirk nockemann , said in a statement .

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .
they have removed not only their capital , but also themselves out of their native germany and now reside in switzerland . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves sweeping economic reforms germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder in his annual new year ’ s speech called on germans to do their part in bringing the country ’ s ailing economy back on track . thanking his countrymen for their willingness to quickly help the victims of friday ’ s earthquake in iran , schröder said that only an economically strong germany could continue to take on its global responsibilities . a social welfare and labor market reform package recently passed by parliament was one way to bring germany back from economic stagnation , the chancellor said . “ for some of you , these measures will cause limitations or cutbacks , ” he said .
“ we know that .
but i assure you that we are trying to spread the burden equally . ” shopping for germany a billion euro tax cut approved just weeks ago will be another way to spur job growth and kick-start the economy , schröder said , reminding germans that they should help along this process by spending more money . “ you personally can be a motor of economic growth , ” schröder said .
“ your confidence in the future can play a role in saving your neighbor ’ s job . ” combating health care fraud personal responsibility is also the key word in reforming germany ’ s health care sector to lower labor costs , according to the chancellor .
starting thursday , germans will have to pay additional fees for doctor ’ s visits , medication and hospital stays , among others . while his social democratic and green government is committed to ensuring universal access to health care regardless of income , schröder said germans should also help to reduce health care costs by avoiding unnecessary treatments . “ wastefulness , exploitation and fraud in the health sector harms us all , ” he said . creating a child-friendly environment referring to germany ’ s drop in education standards , schröder said that federal and state governments would work together to mend the problems .
he added that billions are being spent to expand child-care facilities . “ we want that more women dare to have children , that young people can manage to have both a family and a career , ” he said and asked his fellow citizens to help encourage a child-friendly environment . germans should not just expect politicians to bring about change , though .
“ a welcoming attitude towards children begins in the workplace and in your own neighborhood , ” schröder said . he added that not only germans would gain from further reforms in the coming year .
“ if germany undergoes a decisive and cohesive modernization , not only our country will benefit , ” he said .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .

" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .

the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .

concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .

the german deputy foreign minister has indicated berlin is considering sending peacekeeping troops to war-torn sudan under a u.n. mandate , adding a further dimension to the bundeswehr ’ s deployment in africa . german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller said on tuesday that the german government was contemplating sending civil experts and peacekeeping troops to the east african nation of sudan , which is inching closer to a peace deal after nearly 20 years of civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerstin müller " for the first time there ’ s a very good chance for peace there , " müller -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with german daily berliner zeitung .
" we must support it and fight the roots of terrorism .
the region around the horn of africa after all has proved to be a breeding ground for terror . "
the minister stressed she was in favor of participating in the peace process provided the united nations agreed to set up a peacekeeping mandate in sudan .
" we ’ ll probably first send our civilian experts there , " müller said .
" but we must also examine how far we can contribute to a sudan mission , not just in the civilian aspect , but also possibly on the military front within a small framework , " she added .
sudan close to a peace deal ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar el-bashir on monday , sudan ’ s president omar hassan al-bashir -lrb- photo -rrb- said he expected his government and southern rebels to reach a peace agreement within a week , bringing an end to more than a year of negotiations in kenya .
the two-decades-old civil war between khartoum ’ s islamist government and separatist rebels in the mainly christian and animist south has claimed an estimated two million lives , mainly through hunger and disease .
the u.n. estimates that more than 60,000 people have been uprooted by fighting in the west sudanese region of darfur .
" appalling " humanitarian situation in early december german and french diplomats warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in sudan during a visit to the conflict zone in western sudan .
german diplomat hans günter gnodtke described the situation in refugee camps in the desert region of dafur on the border to chad as " appalling " and said there was a serious lack of food , medicines and medical help in the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan both germany and france have been supporting mediation attempts by the neighboring chad government between the dafur rebels and the sudanese government .
even u.n. secretary-general kofi anan said recently the situation in sudan was " alarming " and said close to a million people were affected by " a rapid worsening of the humanitarian situation . "
concrete german aid to khartoum on tuesday kerstin müller also said germany had already set aside a concrete aid budget for sudan .
" germany already has eared some € 80 million in aid in addition to the € 480 million from the european union , 25 percent of which germany is shouldering , " she said .
the united states has also promised $ 700 million to the region if the two sides manage to clinch a successful peace deal and suggest that the peace accord could be signed in january in washington .
further african deployment for german army a possible deployment to sudan would add a further destination to the german army ’ s deployment on the african continent .
so far the german army 's activities in africa have largely been concerned with dismantling terrorism structures and cells under the mandate of the u.s.-led " operation enduring freedom freedom . "
currently about 300 german soldiers are stationed in the port of djibouti in eastern africa .
they patrol the waters around the horn of africa as well as the southern flanks of the red sea , the coast along somalia and the gulf of aden .
supported by 150 marine personnel in kenya as well as reconnaissance planes and a fleet of ships , they are responsible for keeping shipping routes free and monitoring suspicious vessels supplying suspected terrorist groups .
in november this year , the german parliament extended by a year the mandate for 3,100 soldiers working in africa , afghanistan and kuwait as part of " operation enduring freedom .

ask germans about their new year ’ s eve traditions and they ’ re likely to mention “ dinner for one . "
virtually unknown in the english-speaking world , the british sketch has been aired on german tv for 40 years . not usually inclined to watch movies in their original language , germans make one exception for " dinner for one . "
granted , there ’ s not much of a dialogue to follow , as the 15-minute , black-and-white sketch - also known as " the 90th birthday " - mainly consists of a butler ’ s drunken babbling .
“ dinner for one ” originated in british cabarets in the 1920s and was filmed for german public television in hamburg in 1963 .
the story goes as follows : miss sophie has invited her four best friends to celebrate her 90th birthday .
since all of them are already dead , her butler james impersonates the quartet and toasts the birthday girl in lieu of them and gets helplessly drunk as the evening wears on : james : happy new year , sophie gal ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2003 experts skeptical of german tax amnesty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax amnesty is hoped to tempt stashed away money back into state coffers .
new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .
they have removed not only their capital , but also themselves out of their native germany and now reside in switzerland . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves sweeping economic reforms germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .

granted , there ’ s not much of a dialogue to follow , as the 15-minute , black-and-white sketch - also known as " the 90th birthday " - mainly consists of a butler ’ s drunken babbling .
“ dinner for one ” originated in british cabarets in the 1920s and was filmed for german public television in hamburg in 1963 .
the story goes as follows : miss sophie has invited her four best friends to celebrate her 90th birthday .
since all of them are already dead , her butler james impersonates the quartet and toasts the birthday girl in lieu of them and gets helplessly drunk as the evening wears on : james : happy new year , sophie gal ...
miss sophie : mr. winterbottom !
james : it 's one of the nicest little women ... hick ... one of the nicest little women , that 's ever breathed , ever breathed ...

german chancellor gerhard schröder in his annual new year ’ s speech called on germans to do their part in bringing the country ’ s ailing economy back on track . thanking his countrymen for their willingness to quickly help the victims of friday ’ s earthquake in iran , schröder said that only an economically strong germany could continue to take on its global responsibilities . a social welfare and labor market reform package recently passed by parliament was one way to bring germany back from economic stagnation , the chancellor said . “ for some of you , these measures will cause limitations or cutbacks , ” he said .
“ we know that .
but i assure you that we are trying to spread the burden equally . ” shopping for germany a billion euro tax cut approved just weeks ago will be another way to spur job growth and kick-start the economy , schröder said , reminding germans that they should help along this process by spending more money . “ you personally can be a motor of economic growth , ” schröder said .
“ your confidence in the future can play a role in saving your neighbor ’ s job . ” combating health care fraud personal responsibility is also the key word in reforming germany ’ s health care sector to lower labor costs , according to the chancellor .
starting thursday , germans will have to pay additional fees for doctor ’ s visits , medication and hospital stays , among others . while his social democratic and green government is committed to ensuring universal access to health care regardless of income , schröder said germans should also help to reduce health care costs by avoiding unnecessary treatments . “ wastefulness , exploitation and fraud in the health sector harms us all , ” he said . creating a child-friendly environment referring to germany ’ s drop in education standards , schröder said that federal and state governments would work together to mend the problems .
he added that billions are being spent to expand child-care facilities . “ we want that more women dare to have children , that young people can manage to have both a family and a career , ” he said and asked his fellow citizens to help encourage a child-friendly environment . germans should not just expect politicians to bring about change , though .
“ a welcoming attitude towards children begins in the workplace and in your own neighborhood , ” schröder said . he added that not only germans would gain from further reforms in the coming year .

three of the alleged 19 suicide hijackers had lived and studied in hamburg for years .
a month ago , police arrested a suspected algerian militant in the northern german city as part of a europe-wide probe into a network believed to be recruiting islamists for suicide attacks in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2003 experts skeptical of german tax amnesty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax amnesty is hoped to tempt stashed away money back into state coffers .
new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .
after all germany ’ s super-rich the likes of ex-tennis star boris becker and formula one racing champion michael schumacher have meanwhile made their own tax-saving moves .
they have removed not only their capital , but also themselves out of their native germany and now reside in switzerland . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves sweeping economic reforms germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .

new tax laws that aim to cut people ’ s income tax burden and lure billions of euros in foreign bank accounts back into germany take effect on thursday . after the german government increased capital gains taxes in the early 1990s , thousands of well-heeled germans secretly stashed away their fortunes in so-called low-tax safe havens such as switzerland and luxembourg .
the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder has now granted an amnesty for the rueful sinners , hoping to fill empty state coffers with at least parts of the illicit money .
according to conservative estimates about € 1 trillion were illegally channeled out of germany in the heady days of tax evasion in the early 1990s .
swiss banks alone are said to be hiding € 100 billion in their vaults – funds that have been illicitly withdrawn from the german revenue service .
finance minister hans eichel now hopes that at least part of that money will come back to germany thanks to a new law passed in december .
it grants the repentant tax evaders an amnesty and a reduced tax rate of 25 percent rather then usual 48 percent on the profits they gained in the past 10 years .
government wary of good results but the government is playing down expectations that they expect a flood of money to come back in under the new law .
" we are rather cautious in our expectations , " eichel said .
" we figure on about € 20 billion that will be transferred back to germany .
this would mean an additional tax revenue of € 5 billion across the board in 2004 . "
but the offenders shouldn ’ t wait for too long to declare their riches .
the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .
in 2005 , 35 percent of their profits will be claimed by the german state , but only until the amnesty expires in march of that year .
eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "
swiss banks remain cool according to swiss bank sources , the country ’ s secretive financial institutions remain unruffled by the german decision , and do not fear a major withdrawal of capital .

the 25 percent tax rate is only valid for those coming clean by the end of 2004 .

eichel hopes his efforts will match the success rate of a tax amnesty granted by italy in 2001 .
the government in rome was able to lure more than € 60 billion back into the country and gained about 1.5 billion in additional taxes .
experts say this was primarily thanks to a purely symbolic tax rate of just 2.5 percent .
friedrich merz , finance expert for germany ‘ s opposition conservative christian democrats , is also doubtful whether a ten times higher tax rate here may really tempt offenders .
" someone who brings back € 100,000 , has to pay € 25,000 in taxes , " said merz .
" it ’ s extremely doubtful that anyone is willing to strike such a deal . "

ask germans about their new year ’ s eve traditions and they ’ re likely to mention “ dinner for one . "
virtually unknown in the english-speaking world , the british sketch has been aired on german tv for 40 years . not usually inclined to watch movies in their original language , germans make one exception for " dinner for one . "
granted , there ’ s not much of a dialogue to follow , as the 15-minute , black-and-white sketch - also known as " the 90th birthday " - mainly consists of a butler ’ s drunken babbling .
“ dinner for one ” originated in british cabarets in the 1920s and was filmed for german public television in hamburg in 1963 .
the story goes as follows : miss sophie has invited her four best friends to celebrate her 90th birthday .
since all of them are already dead , her butler james impersonates the quartet and toasts the birthday girl in lieu of them and gets helplessly drunk as the evening wears on : james : happy new year , sophie gal ...

musician , composer and producer eduardo makaroff comes from the birthplace of tango - the argentinian capital , buenos aires .
he moved to paris where he met up with two djs , and they collaborated on what they considered to be short project .
but the single they produced was so popular that the one-off gotan project expanded into a permanent group and a first album .
i lived in argentina for 36 years doing a lot of things around music , tv programmes , radio programmes and television for children .
the gotan project : from one-off to permanent group i went to live in paris 14 years ago .
i went there mainly as a tango artist , but also as a producer .
i developed my career basically with tango .
with the gotan project , we make tango music from my hometown buenos aires meet with electronic music from everywhere .
it 's amazing that it works .
you know , paris is the second capital of tango music .
historically it 's in paris where tango became very important and accepted by everyone in the world and where tango can develop because a lot of composers , musicians , singers , a lot of writers and dancers from buenos aires went to paris to develop and to create .
so carlos gardel made his first film in paris .
piazzolla lived in paris for many years .
my case is quite a normal case of a tango musician from buenos aires who went to paris to continue his career .
because i have two little children who were born there four and two years ago , i can say that my home now is in paris - in the boulevard st germain .
of course i lost something by moving from argentina to paris , i lost a lot of things .
but it was a choice .
we left a lot of beautiful things behind in argentina .
the europeans - maybe they do n't have so much " calor humano " , you know - human warmth .
i left my family , a lot of friends .
but i 'm very happy to be in paris and not in argentina now because of all the good things we have here .
argentina is now a disaster .
i think that the fusion of different strands of music i put together with the gotan project proves that we can do a lot of new things in our music .
sometimes in paris you are more open-minded .
but in argentina there is also a lot of creativity .
so it 's a bit of a ping-pong .
i have a lot of argentinian musicians and friends who were living in paris before me .
so , we go and we come back .

nguyen vu binh , 35 , was found guilty on espionage charges in a trial that lasted less than three hours .
he was arrested in september 2002 after he wrote articles criticising a border agreement between china and vietnam .
human rights groups have condemned the trial , which foreign journalists and diplomats were barred from attending .

he went on to write several articles published on the internet which called for political reform in vietnam .
he also clashed with the authorities when he tried to set up an opposition party .
the china-vietnam land pact he criticised was called some thoughts on the china-vietnam border agreement .
the agreement , signed in december 1999 more than 20 years after china and vietnam fought a bloody border war , has been roundly criticised by many vietnamese intellectuals who accuse hanoi of conceding too much to its more powerful neighbour .

he is one of four people from mid wales to receive an mbe - the others coming from machynlleth , aberystwyth and rhayader .
mr booth , an oxford graduate , opened his first bookshop in hay in 1961 and pursued the idea that a town full of bookshops could be an international attraction .
this is a tremendous honour , especially because i 've taken a radical position in the past richard booth , king of hay-on-wye forty years later that dream has become a reality with hay-on-wye boasting a host of bookshops and being the venue of the now internationally recognised literature festival , attracting 500,000 visitors each year .
former us president bill clinton has been among the speakers attracted to the week-long event .
mr booth persevered with his ambition of creating a book town , even resorting to such stunts as his 1977 declaration of independence for hay-on-wye when mr booth proclaimed himself king and his horse was made prime minister .
and in 2000 he held his own investiture of the hay house of lords introducing 21 new hereditary peers for the kingdom of hay .
" this is a tremendous honour , especially because i 've taken a radical position in the past , " said mr booth of his own mbe .

25,000 people a year now visit the moma in machynlleth another person who helped revitalise a mid wales market town is ruth lambert , chairman of the tabernacle trust in machynlleth , who has been awarded an mbe for services to culture .
mrs lambert has been at the helm of the museum of modern art wales -lrb- momaw -rrb- since it was converted into an art gallery from a chapel in the mid 1980s .
the momaw now has 25,000 visitors a year and houses exhibitions throughout the year , mainly championing contemporary welsh art .
it also hosts the nationally important machynlleth festival every august as well as staging numerous concerts throughout the year .
" i see myself as a figurehead because a lot of people have worked very hard to make the trust work , " said mrs lambert .
four people from mid wales have won mbes " this is a great honour and represents the tabernacle 's contribution to welsh culture . "
wyn griffiths from cwmdauddwr , near rhayader has been awarded an mbe after 50 years service to st john ambulance brigade in powys .
now 76 , he joined the brigade as an ambulance member in rhayader in 1951 and has attended hundreds of events providing first aid coverage and teaching first aid skills .
he also helped to deliver two babies while on duty .
" i remember i had to take the expectant mother from llandrindod wells to hereford for the delivery , " said mr griffiths .
" but we only got as far as crossgates when the birth started so we rushed back to the local hospital and i had to keep the engine running to keep the mother warm while she gave birth in the ambulance , " he added .

alan thomas , who has served on the tenby lifeboat for 37 years , the last 21 as the coxswain , has been made an mbe .
the 53-year-old , who continued a long standing family tradition by volunteering to join the crew , said he was delighted to get the award .
he is a familiar face to the many visitors to the town as his day job involves skippering the boat that runs between tenby and caldey island .
i was shocked but very pleased when i received the letter donald william griffiths " i was very surprised when i found out , " he said .
" i have been involved with the lifeboat all my life .
my father was also the cox and my grandfather was on the crew .
" the best thing about it is when you go and bring someone in who would not be coming back otherwise . "
mr thomas lives within a stone 's throw of donald william griffiths , who has been awarded an mbe for his services to the air training corps -lrb- atc -rrb- .

the former pembroke power station engineer was secretary for 30 years before serving as chairman for the last 13 years .
mr griffiths , who is 78 , said : " i was shocked but very pleased when i received the letter .
donald griffiths was a founder member of the 1284 squadron " it is always great to see the boys and girls go on in life .
they do n't have to go into the services , although some do , but the atc seems to turn them into better citizens .
" i enjoyed my time in the raf .
it knocked the rough edges off me and i met some good people .
i continue to meet many good people in the atc . "
services to education john maurice brock , chairman of the school governors at sageston primary school on the outskirts of tenby , has also been made an mbe .
