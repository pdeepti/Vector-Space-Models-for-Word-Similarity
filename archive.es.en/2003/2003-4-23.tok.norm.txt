climb the mountain this spring and you may encounter a middle-aged entrepreneur chattering busily into his mobile phone .

everest news for beijingers on the move " we strive to give the notion of ' wireless communication anytime , anywhere ' a new meaning , " says mr zhang .
to be fair to mr zhang , the world 's highest mountain promises to be a crowded place this spring .
twenty teams of mountaineers from around the world will be ploughing towards the summit .
the climbing world is gathering to celebrate the 50th anniversary of everest 's conquest by sir edmund hillary and tenzing norgay with gimmicks and stunts of all kinds .
a nepalese sherpa aims to shimmy up to the summit in just 15 hours , while british royal marines hope to screen a live tv broadcast from the notorious north-east ridge .

gimmick mr zhang refuses to disclose how much sohu and its partners are paying to sponsor the china mountaineering association 's 50-strong ' 2003 china sohu team ' climb , which will be filmed by state television for good measure .
but he reckons his time spent away from the office is well-spent .
he is probably right .
in practice , we remain a long way from being able to send pictures to anyone , anywhere at anytime , and not just because china mobile will take down its everest masts after the climb .
even at moderate altitudes , few mobile users can yet send photos to friends on different phone networks .
" this trip is symbolic , " says mr zhang .
it conjures mass communication with a technology " applicable to any individual " .
aspirational images few of the urban chinese who are sohu.com 's key market get the chance to go climbing in tibet .
risky sports make compulsive viewing but in crowded cities the great outdoors is rapidly becoming an elite destination - rather than a life-sentence to rural poverty - and domestic tourism is taking off along with the consumer lifestyle .
mr zhang himself was introduced to mountaineering two years ago by a pal who owns a real estate firm .
mobiles on everest offers a potent aspirational mix .
and using them to send dramatic digital data popularises one of the industry 's lushest new revenue streams .
not for the first time , mr zhang looks like hitting his market ahead of the curve .
the beijing graduate returned to china from the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology to found sohu.com in the late 1990s .
he tells how sohu.com " caught the last train " to list on new york 's nasdaq technology stocks index in july 2000 , just as the dotcom boom came crashing down , but survived to turn its first profit in the third quarter of 2002 .
perhaps the most revealing aspect of this adventure in high-altitude advertising is that communist china 's latest assault on everest is being paid for by a new york-listed company .

or maybe not .
climb the mountain this spring and you may encounter a middle-aged entrepreneur chattering busily into his mobile phone .
it will be charles zhang , founder and chief executive of sohu.com , one of china 's most successful internet companies .
mr zhang 's trekking diary will appear daily on sohu.com 's site alongside a medley of news , shopping tips and adverts .
expect it to be garnished with digital snapshots from his mobile handset .
' anytime , anywhere ' in a shrewd marketing move , sohu.com has joined forces with telecoms operator china mobile to bring text and photo messaging to everest using phones donated by us firm motorola .
everest news for beijingers on the move " we strive to give the notion of ' wireless communication anytime , anywhere ' a new meaning , " says mr zhang .
to be fair to mr zhang , the world 's highest mountain promises to be a crowded place this spring .
twenty teams of mountaineers from around the world will be ploughing towards the summit .
the climbing world is gathering to celebrate the 50th anniversary of everest 's conquest by sir edmund hillary and tenzing norgay with gimmicks and stunts of all kinds .
a nepalese sherpa aims to shimmy up to the summit in just 15 hours , while british royal marines hope to screen a live tv broadcast from the notorious north-east ridge .
new tech , old ambition so the arrival of three truckloads of china mobile wireless equipment at everest base camp should not raise any eyebrows .
we want to show people that every individual , without special equipment , just with one mobile phone , can do a lot of things charles zhang china mobile says the project is a " momentous test " as wireless technology generally only works below a height of 4,000 meters .
" as long as we have this wireless station , they beam the signal towards everest , we 'll be able to enjoy communication all the way to the top , " says mr zhang .
but why bother ?
mountaineers frequently use satellite phones - like those taken to iraq by journalists - which can send live , if wobbly , video .
something for everyone ?
" that 's tv technology .
we want to show people that every individual , without special equipment , just with one mobile phone , can do a lot of things , " retorts mr zhang .
everest 's first conquerors celebrate victory industry experts agree that mobile phones offer better pictures than sat phones .
even the video is " remarkably watchable " , says andy heselwood , head of mobile video services at bt broadcast services , which provides tv networks with satellite slots .
besides viewing video on mobile phones " is n't about quality ... it 's something that appeals to our childlike need for immediacy , " he adds .

under new proposals which could be rolled out across the country , customs officers at ports and airports in devon , cornwall and dorset could be replaced by mobile units .
the public and commercial services union fears officers could be called upon to work anywhere in the region , or even as far afield as dover and gatwick .
it has been in talks with management and is mounting a campaign to draw attention to its concerns .
david millar of the public and commercial services union , said the move would " open the back door " to smugglers .
targeting ports north cornwall mp paul tyler said : " customs management is effectively hoisting a flag which says smugglers will get in with no problems in the south west .
" in terms of drugs it could be disastrous . "
customs and excise say they want to increase the detection rate by targeting ports favoured by smugglers .
it says staff unwilling or unable to make the transition into mobile teams will be accommodated as far as possible in other jobs or vacancies in other government departments .
