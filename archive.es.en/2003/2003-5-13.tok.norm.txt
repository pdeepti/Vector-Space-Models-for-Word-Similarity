the rebuilt amber room , known to germans and russians as the “ eighth wonder of the world , ” reopens near st. petersburg in its entirety on tuesday .
the actual masterpiece has been lost without a trace since 1945 . culture ministers from russia and germany on tuesday will be among the first people to see the completely reconstructed amber room , an 18th century masterpiece that originally belonged to the prussian king frederick i. for more than 20 years , dozens of russian craftsmen have been sanding , cutting , coloring and gluing over six tons of amber to rebuild the room in the town of tsarskoye selo , literally “ czar 's village ” , near st. petersburg . peter the great of russia first admired the amber-paneled room in 1712 during a visit to frederick ’ s palace in berlin .
thousands of pieces of amber were assembled into intricate mosaics and decorated with ornaments , figures and patterns . czar peter added the ostentatious panels to his own art collection in 1717 , when he received them as a gift from the prussian king 's son and successor frederick wilhelm i. the german monarch did n't much appreciate art , but was hoping for russia 's help in fighting sweden and the gesture was meant to put the seal on the " everlasting " alliance between prussia and russia . over a century and a half later , nazi germany and soviet russia were at war and in 1941 nazi " art protection officers " took the amber room panels to the then german city of königsberg , known now as kaliningrad , russia . whereabouts unknown for four years the amber room was on display in the city palace , open to the public as a prussian work of art , until the soviets captured königsberg in 1945 .
then the pieces were presumably packed up , as a letter from alfred rohde , the director of palace 's art collection , indicated in january 1945 .
since then the panels have been lost , and the issue of their whereabouts has become a realm of wild speculation . numerous theories say that the amber room was smuggled out of königsberg to avoid it being confiscated by the allies as looted art , and many a treasure hunter has searched for the panels .
the east german secret police tried to locate them for years , but had no more luck than anyone else .
mysterious circumstances surrounded the deaths of at least two of the treasure hunters , feeding the amber room myth and the conspiracy theorists .
some allege that the panels burned up as the palace in königsberg destroyed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosaic that is believed to have been part of the amber room .
it was found by a lawyer in the northern german city of bremen in 1997 .
although the nazis claimed the room as a strictly german artwork , it was n't until peter 's daughter , elizabeth , was crowned czarina in 1741 that it started to take on its final glorious shape . elizabeth ordered that the amber room be assembled in her favorite palace in tsarskoye selo , which the italian architect francesco bartolemo rastrelli was modifying for her .
but the rooms were too big for the 22 panels , so rastrelli had more panels with semi-precious stones and 17 additional amber panels constructed to supplement the original materials .
the remaining space was covered with trompe l 'oeil paintings meant to look like even more amber panels .
the work was finally finished in 1770 . symbol of changing german-russian relations the more than two decades of work that went into restoring the masterpiece was an enormous undertaking .
the only pictures that existed of the amber room were black and white , so , in order to achieve the right tones , the craftsmen were obliged to photograph their shards of amber and then painstakingly compare the shades to the original photos until they were sure the match was perfect . capturing the varying levels of the layered amber and the etchings was more difficult .
the leningrad institute for mining and geo-mechanics provided the answer by creating spatial images using a special technique called photogrammetry that showed the heights and depths up to less than a millimeter , resulting in a sort of topographical map of the room . now completely reconstructed to match its former glory , the amber room will be officially opened by russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder on march 31 as part of celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of st. petersburg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the town of tsarskoye selo -lrb- also called pushkin -rrb- 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.05.2003 foreign extremist population shrinking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radical organizations , such as the banned hizb ut-tahrir , have reduced in number the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to new government report .
the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working . concerted efforts by germany 's security agencies in monitoring and investigating religious extremist groups seem to have made an impact on the numbers of radical individuals and groups operating in the country over the past 12 months .
figures for 2002 from the federal office for the protection of the constitution show a fall in numbers , with a total number of 57,350 individuals described by the government as " radicals , " including 30,000 known islamic extremists . the overall individual figures represent a decrease of 2,000 from the previous year 's results .
organizations classed as " extremist " by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- have also been reduced to 65 from 69 .
the latest report marks the first drop in the numbers in germany the government began publishing records on extremist groups in 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily with the latest report .
however , the report , presented by federal interior minister otto schily in berlin on tuesday , also stated that the number of right-wing extremists in germany has risen .
figures show that the number of violent acts where offenders showed extreme right-wing motivation increased in 2002 to 10,902 from 10,054 the previous year , an 8.4 percent increase .
the figures for individuals termed as " politically motivated foreign criminals , " including the increasing number of baltic drug gangs operating in germany , has also risen .
successful cooperation but it was the reduction in radical religious groups that otto schily focussed on as evidence of the success of cooperative investigations between german authorities and foreign agencies in the struggle for security .
" the fight against extremism and terrorism is the highest priority for this government , " declared schily .
" the threat of international terrorism continues to be very large , but through national and international cooperation , these terror networks can be weakened , " he said .
recently , german efforts in combating extremism and associated terrorism have been praised by washington .
germany 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the state department report , released earlier this month , described germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism , " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
the german government has continued to support the vigorous anti-terror campaign it set up in the wake of the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in the united states in 2001 .
security packages pushed through by parliament saw increases in budgets and personnel handed to the police and bka , and new laws were passed making it possible to crack down on extremist organizations .
new laws target the spread of hate as investigations into radical groups continue throughout the country , the latest figures seem to show that germany is making steady progress in breaking up extremist cells and hunting down those accused of acts of terrorism .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a new law permits german authorities to ban any extremist group it can prove spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and deems such activities as a threat to national security .
at the end of 2002 , following police raids in five german states , the hizb ut-tahir islamic fundamentalist organization was banned in germany .
the group first came to the attention of german authorities when a hizb ut-tahir speaker addressed a rally in berlin and made anti-american statements to a largely extremist or right-wing crowd .
further research found that literature advocating the destruction of israel and the killing of jews had been spread by members of the group around universities , colleges and islamic centers throughout the country .
hizb ut-tahir became the third radical organization banned by german authorities since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne .
the cologne-based union of islamic associations and communities , also known as the caliph state , was banned in 2002 after its leader metin kaplan called for the death of a competitor and was arrested and imprisoned .
sowing the seeds of terrorism kai hirschmann , a terrorism researcher at the federal college of security studies in bonn , told dw-world at the time that although organizations like hizb ut tahir could not be called terrorists until proven links were found , the same spirit of achieving political goals through inciting violence was evident in their rhetoric and their means of delivering it .
" just as you reach a city by first passing its suburbs , you have to reach terrorists by getting into their environment , " he said .

the rebuilt amber room , known to germans and russians as the “ eighth wonder of the world , ” reopens near st. petersburg in its entirety on tuesday .
the actual masterpiece has been lost without a trace since 1945 . culture ministers from russia and germany on tuesday will be among the first people to see the completely reconstructed amber room , an 18th century masterpiece that originally belonged to the prussian king frederick i. for more than 20 years , dozens of russian craftsmen have been sanding , cutting , coloring and gluing over six tons of amber to rebuild the room in the town of tsarskoye selo , literally “ czar 's village ” , near st. petersburg . peter the great of russia first admired the amber-paneled room in 1712 during a visit to frederick ’ s palace in berlin .
thousands of pieces of amber were assembled into intricate mosaics and decorated with ornaments , figures and patterns . czar peter added the ostentatious panels to his own art collection in 1717 , when he received them as a gift from the prussian king 's son and successor frederick wilhelm i. the german monarch did n't much appreciate art , but was hoping for russia 's help in fighting sweden and the gesture was meant to put the seal on the " everlasting " alliance between prussia and russia . over a century and a half later , nazi germany and soviet russia were at war and in 1941 nazi " art protection officers " took the amber room panels to the then german city of königsberg , known now as kaliningrad , russia . whereabouts unknown for four years the amber room was on display in the city palace , open to the public as a prussian work of art , until the soviets captured königsberg in 1945 .
then the pieces were presumably packed up , as a letter from alfred rohde , the director of palace 's art collection , indicated in january 1945 .
since then the panels have been lost , and the issue of their whereabouts has become a realm of wild speculation . numerous theories say that the amber room was smuggled out of königsberg to avoid it being confiscated by the allies as looted art , and many a treasure hunter has searched for the panels .
the east german secret police tried to locate them for years , but had no more luck than anyone else .
mysterious circumstances surrounded the deaths of at least two of the treasure hunters , feeding the amber room myth and the conspiracy theorists .
some allege that the panels burned up as the palace in königsberg destroyed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosaic that is believed to have been part of the amber room .
it was found by a lawyer in the northern german city of bremen in 1997 .
although the nazis claimed the room as a strictly german artwork , it was n't until peter 's daughter , elizabeth , was crowned czarina in 1741 that it started to take on its final glorious shape . elizabeth ordered that the amber room be assembled in her favorite palace in tsarskoye selo , which the italian architect francesco bartolemo rastrelli was modifying for her .
but the rooms were too big for the 22 panels , so rastrelli had more panels with semi-precious stones and 17 additional amber panels constructed to supplement the original materials .
the remaining space was covered with trompe l 'oeil paintings meant to look like even more amber panels .
the work was finally finished in 1770 . symbol of changing german-russian relations the more than two decades of work that went into restoring the masterpiece was an enormous undertaking .
the only pictures that existed of the amber room were black and white , so , in order to achieve the right tones , the craftsmen were obliged to photograph their shards of amber and then painstakingly compare the shades to the original photos until they were sure the match was perfect . capturing the varying levels of the layered amber and the etchings was more difficult .
the leningrad institute for mining and geo-mechanics provided the answer by creating spatial images using a special technique called photogrammetry that showed the heights and depths up to less than a millimeter , resulting in a sort of topographical map of the room . now completely reconstructed to match its former glory , the amber room will be officially opened by russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder on march 31 as part of celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of st. petersburg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the town of tsarskoye selo -lrb- also called pushkin -rrb- 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.05.2003 foreign extremist population shrinking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radical organizations , such as the banned hizb ut-tahrir , have reduced in number the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to new government report .
the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working . concerted efforts by germany 's security agencies in monitoring and investigating religious extremist groups seem to have made an impact on the numbers of radical individuals and groups operating in the country over the past 12 months .
figures for 2002 from the federal office for the protection of the constitution show a fall in numbers , with a total number of 57,350 individuals described by the government as " radicals , " including 30,000 known islamic extremists . the overall individual figures represent a decrease of 2,000 from the previous year 's results .
organizations classed as " extremist " by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- have also been reduced to 65 from 69 .
the latest report marks the first drop in the numbers in germany the government began publishing records on extremist groups in 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily with the latest report .
however , the report , presented by federal interior minister otto schily in berlin on tuesday , also stated that the number of right-wing extremists in germany has risen .
figures show that the number of violent acts where offenders showed extreme right-wing motivation increased in 2002 to 10,902 from 10,054 the previous year , an 8.4 percent increase .
the figures for individuals termed as " politically motivated foreign criminals , " including the increasing number of baltic drug gangs operating in germany , has also risen .
successful cooperation but it was the reduction in radical religious groups that otto schily focussed on as evidence of the success of cooperative investigations between german authorities and foreign agencies in the struggle for security .
" the fight against extremism and terrorism is the highest priority for this government , " declared schily .
" the threat of international terrorism continues to be very large , but through national and international cooperation , these terror networks can be weakened , " he said .
recently , german efforts in combating extremism and associated terrorism have been praised by washington .
germany 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the state department report , released earlier this month , described germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism , " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
the german government has continued to support the vigorous anti-terror campaign it set up in the wake of the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in the united states in 2001 .
security packages pushed through by parliament saw increases in budgets and personnel handed to the police and bka , and new laws were passed making it possible to crack down on extremist organizations .
new laws target the spread of hate as investigations into radical groups continue throughout the country , the latest figures seem to show that germany is making steady progress in breaking up extremist cells and hunting down those accused of acts of terrorism .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a new law permits german authorities to ban any extremist group it can prove spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and deems such activities as a threat to national security .
at the end of 2002 , following police raids in five german states , the hizb ut-tahir islamic fundamentalist organization was banned in germany .
the group first came to the attention of german authorities when a hizb ut-tahir speaker addressed a rally in berlin and made anti-american statements to a largely extremist or right-wing crowd .
further research found that literature advocating the destruction of israel and the killing of jews had been spread by members of the group around universities , colleges and islamic centers throughout the country .
hizb ut-tahir became the third radical organization banned by german authorities since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne .
the cologne-based union of islamic associations and communities , also known as the caliph state , was banned in 2002 after its leader metin kaplan called for the death of a competitor and was arrested and imprisoned .
sowing the seeds of terrorism kai hirschmann , a terrorism researcher at the federal college of security studies in bonn , told dw-world at the time that although organizations like hizb ut tahir could not be called terrorists until proven links were found , the same spirit of achieving political goals through inciting violence was evident in their rhetoric and their means of delivering it .
" just as you reach a city by first passing its suburbs , you have to reach terrorists by getting into their environment , " he said .
the latest report also shows that , despite the crackdown throughout germany , the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs , continues to attract followers and remains defiant and strong .
milli görüs promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
nor did the report address the current split in thinking between germany and turkey over the group .
last month , turkey ’ s religious-conservative government ordered its embassies to offer milli görüs their support .
the group , formed in 1985 in cologne to support turkish nationalism and oppose the separation of state and religion , has long been criticized by german officials as being anti-semitic and against liberal western values . home-grown radicals still a problem although a certain level of success has been achieved in combatting foreign religious extremists , home-grown problems remain .
despite efforts to ban the ultra right-wing , neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , the report shows that the organization continues to attract new skinheads and disaffected youths to its ranks .
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
a government effort to outlaw the npd was quashed in march when the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled that the use of senior-level npd informants in the prosecution 's case had created bias .
the case was discontinued and the likelihood that a new action will be taken against the npd remains remote at this time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de number of foreign extremists in germany climbs the government says the number of religious extremists in the country rose slightly in 2001 .

thousands of pieces of amber were assembled into intricate mosaics and decorated with ornaments , figures and patterns . czar peter added the ostentatious panels to his own art collection in 1717 , when he received them as a gift from the prussian king 's son and successor frederick wilhelm i. the german monarch did n't much appreciate art , but was hoping for russia 's help in fighting sweden and the gesture was meant to put the seal on the " everlasting " alliance between prussia and russia . over a century and a half later , nazi germany and soviet russia were at war and in 1941 nazi " art protection officers " took the amber room panels to the then german city of königsberg , known now as kaliningrad , russia . whereabouts unknown for four years the amber room was on display in the city palace , open to the public as a prussian work of art , until the soviets captured königsberg in 1945 .
then the pieces were presumably packed up , as a letter from alfred rohde , the director of palace 's art collection , indicated in january 1945 .
since then the panels have been lost , and the issue of their whereabouts has become a realm of wild speculation . numerous theories say that the amber room was smuggled out of königsberg to avoid it being confiscated by the allies as looted art , and many a treasure hunter has searched for the panels .
the east german secret police tried to locate them for years , but had no more luck than anyone else .
mysterious circumstances surrounded the deaths of at least two of the treasure hunters , feeding the amber room myth and the conspiracy theorists .
some allege that the panels burned up as the palace in königsberg destroyed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosaic that is believed to have been part of the amber room .
it was found by a lawyer in the northern german city of bremen in 1997 .
although the nazis claimed the room as a strictly german artwork , it was n't until peter 's daughter , elizabeth , was crowned czarina in 1741 that it started to take on its final glorious shape . elizabeth ordered that the amber room be assembled in her favorite palace in tsarskoye selo , which the italian architect francesco bartolemo rastrelli was modifying for her .
but the rooms were too big for the 22 panels , so rastrelli had more panels with semi-precious stones and 17 additional amber panels constructed to supplement the original materials .
the remaining space was covered with trompe l 'oeil paintings meant to look like even more amber panels .
the work was finally finished in 1770 . symbol of changing german-russian relations the more than two decades of work that went into restoring the masterpiece was an enormous undertaking .
the only pictures that existed of the amber room were black and white , so , in order to achieve the right tones , the craftsmen were obliged to photograph their shards of amber and then painstakingly compare the shades to the original photos until they were sure the match was perfect . capturing the varying levels of the layered amber and the etchings was more difficult .
the leningrad institute for mining and geo-mechanics provided the answer by creating spatial images using a special technique called photogrammetry that showed the heights and depths up to less than a millimeter , resulting in a sort of topographical map of the room . now completely reconstructed to match its former glory , the amber room will be officially opened by russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder on march 31 as part of celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of st. petersburg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the town of tsarskoye selo -lrb- also called pushkin -rrb- 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.05.2003 foreign extremist population shrinking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radical organizations , such as the banned hizb ut-tahrir , have reduced in number the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to new government report .
the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working . concerted efforts by germany 's security agencies in monitoring and investigating religious extremist groups seem to have made an impact on the numbers of radical individuals and groups operating in the country over the past 12 months .
figures for 2002 from the federal office for the protection of the constitution show a fall in numbers , with a total number of 57,350 individuals described by the government as " radicals , " including 30,000 known islamic extremists . the overall individual figures represent a decrease of 2,000 from the previous year 's results .
organizations classed as " extremist " by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- have also been reduced to 65 from 69 .
the latest report marks the first drop in the numbers in germany the government began publishing records on extremist groups in 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily with the latest report .
however , the report , presented by federal interior minister otto schily in berlin on tuesday , also stated that the number of right-wing extremists in germany has risen .
figures show that the number of violent acts where offenders showed extreme right-wing motivation increased in 2002 to 10,902 from 10,054 the previous year , an 8.4 percent increase .
the figures for individuals termed as " politically motivated foreign criminals , " including the increasing number of baltic drug gangs operating in germany , has also risen .
successful cooperation but it was the reduction in radical religious groups that otto schily focussed on as evidence of the success of cooperative investigations between german authorities and foreign agencies in the struggle for security .
" the fight against extremism and terrorism is the highest priority for this government , " declared schily .
" the threat of international terrorism continues to be very large , but through national and international cooperation , these terror networks can be weakened , " he said .
recently , german efforts in combating extremism and associated terrorism have been praised by washington .
germany 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the state department report , released earlier this month , described germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism , " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
the german government has continued to support the vigorous anti-terror campaign it set up in the wake of the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in the united states in 2001 .
security packages pushed through by parliament saw increases in budgets and personnel handed to the police and bka , and new laws were passed making it possible to crack down on extremist organizations .
new laws target the spread of hate as investigations into radical groups continue throughout the country , the latest figures seem to show that germany is making steady progress in breaking up extremist cells and hunting down those accused of acts of terrorism .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a new law permits german authorities to ban any extremist group it can prove spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and deems such activities as a threat to national security .
at the end of 2002 , following police raids in five german states , the hizb ut-tahir islamic fundamentalist organization was banned in germany .
the group first came to the attention of german authorities when a hizb ut-tahir speaker addressed a rally in berlin and made anti-american statements to a largely extremist or right-wing crowd .
further research found that literature advocating the destruction of israel and the killing of jews had been spread by members of the group around universities , colleges and islamic centers throughout the country .
hizb ut-tahir became the third radical organization banned by german authorities since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne .
the cologne-based union of islamic associations and communities , also known as the caliph state , was banned in 2002 after its leader metin kaplan called for the death of a competitor and was arrested and imprisoned .
sowing the seeds of terrorism kai hirschmann , a terrorism researcher at the federal college of security studies in bonn , told dw-world at the time that although organizations like hizb ut tahir could not be called terrorists until proven links were found , the same spirit of achieving political goals through inciting violence was evident in their rhetoric and their means of delivering it .
" just as you reach a city by first passing its suburbs , you have to reach terrorists by getting into their environment , " he said .
the latest report also shows that , despite the crackdown throughout germany , the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs , continues to attract followers and remains defiant and strong .
milli görüs promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
nor did the report address the current split in thinking between germany and turkey over the group .
last month , turkey ’ s religious-conservative government ordered its embassies to offer milli görüs their support .
the group , formed in 1985 in cologne to support turkish nationalism and oppose the separation of state and religion , has long been criticized by german officials as being anti-semitic and against liberal western values . home-grown radicals still a problem although a certain level of success has been achieved in combatting foreign religious extremists , home-grown problems remain .
despite efforts to ban the ultra right-wing , neo-nazi national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , the report shows that the organization continues to attract new skinheads and disaffected youths to its ranks .
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
a government effort to outlaw the npd was quashed in march when the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe ruled that the use of senior-level npd informants in the prosecution 's case had created bias .

new laws target the spread of hate as investigations into radical groups continue throughout the country , the latest figures seem to show that germany is making steady progress in breaking up extremist cells and hunting down those accused of acts of terrorism .
although there are often unsubstantiated links between religious extremists and terrorist acts , a new law permits german authorities to ban any extremist group it can prove spreads anti-semitic propaganda or advocates violence as a means for change and deems such activities as a threat to national security .
at the end of 2002 , following police raids in five german states , the hizb ut-tahir islamic fundamentalist organization was banned in germany .
the group first came to the attention of german authorities when a hizb ut-tahir speaker addressed a rally in berlin and made anti-american statements to a largely extremist or right-wing crowd .

the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working . concerted efforts by germany 's security agencies in monitoring and investigating religious extremist groups seem to have made an impact on the numbers of radical individuals and groups operating in the country over the past 12 months .
figures for 2002 from the federal office for the protection of the constitution show a fall in numbers , with a total number of 57,350 individuals described by the government as " radicals , " including 30,000 known islamic extremists . the overall individual figures represent a decrease of 2,000 from the previous year 's results .
organizations classed as " extremist " by the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- have also been reduced to 65 from 69 .
the latest report marks the first drop in the numbers in germany the government began publishing records on extremist groups in 1998 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily with the latest report .
however , the report , presented by federal interior minister otto schily in berlin on tuesday , also stated that the number of right-wing extremists in germany has risen .
figures show that the number of violent acts where offenders showed extreme right-wing motivation increased in 2002 to 10,902 from 10,054 the previous year , an 8.4 percent increase .
the figures for individuals termed as " politically motivated foreign criminals , " including the increasing number of baltic drug gangs operating in germany , has also risen .
successful cooperation but it was the reduction in radical religious groups that otto schily focussed on as evidence of the success of cooperative investigations between german authorities and foreign agencies in the struggle for security .
" the fight against extremism and terrorism is the highest priority for this government , " declared schily .
" the threat of international terrorism continues to be very large , but through national and international cooperation , these terror networks can be weakened , " he said .
recently , german efforts in combating extremism and associated terrorism have been praised by washington .
germany 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .

energywatch says that households are then faced with huge bills which are difficult for them to pay .
it is launching a campaign on tuesday calling for more clarity on estimated bills and is expected to name the worst offenders .
nearly half the 86,000 complaints received by energywatch last year related to billing and accounts .
it said it has heard of energy suppliers chasing the wrong customer for payment , of people being disconnected over " grossly over-estimated " bills and others being hassled by debt collection firms . "
if you have been waiting a year you should be prudent and put that money aside " british gas in february this year energywatch accused british gas of " corporate apathy " after claiming the company had not billed some customers for their electricity supply for more than four years .
a spokesman for the company said it was sympathetic but warned : " if you have been waiting a year you should be prudent and put that money aside . "
the watchdog is backing calls for all estimated bills to contain a clear warning to ensure customers know they can obtain their own reading which may be lower .
ann robinson , chair of energywatch , said : " consumers tell us that inaccurate bills irritate them .
" that 's why energywatch , as the consumer champion , will be launching a major campaign to tackle the problems that inaccurate energy bills cause consumers . "
electricity saving energywatch 's campaign follows a report from the national audit office last week which suggested electricity companies had not passed on savings on wholesale prices to customers .
the report also found that households which stayed loyal to the company they bought their electricity from before deregulation of the market in 1999 were paying up to 22 % more than those who switched supplier .
energy giants powergen , british gas , npower and scottishpower issued a joint statement in which they promised to tackle billing problems , particularly with customers wishing to switch supplier .

and the us authorities in iraq have given her more help since that publicity .
but now she needs the ministry of defence to authorise an inquiry in basra - something they have so far refused to do .
french cameraman fred nerac and lebanese translator hussein osman went missing after their vehicle was caught in a fire fight between american and iraqi forces on march 22 as it sped from the southern city of basra toward the kuwaiti border .
veteran itn journalist terry lloyd , travelling in a second vehicle , was killed in the attack .
the missing men 's press passes have been recovered , but their bodies were not found at the scene , raising hopes they may still be alive .
mystery remains for fabienne the priority is finding a body .
terry lloyd was recovered in the al-jumhuriya hospital - itn believe that a red crescent ambulance took him there .
what happened to fred and hussein remains a mystery - there is always the remotest possibility that they may be alive .
for fred 's family the grieving process ca n't really start until they know for sure what happened to him .
investigation " we are asking the british government to actively pursue an investigation into their disappearance , " itn chief executive stuart purvis told reporters at monday 's news conference .
" defence secretary -lrb- geoff -rrb- hoon has told us he will not order an investigation until it is proven a war crime has been committed ... but why do we have to produce evidence of such a crime to find these men ? "
itn believe that their party were caught up in a friendly fire incident between us troops and some iraqi vehicles .
they think that the bullets may have come from the us troops but can not get confirmation .
they 've got an investigation team out there in basra looking for eye witnesses .
the road between az zubayr and basra was a main highway through a wasteland - a major route , lots of people would have seen something .
they 've also distributed thousands of leaflets in arabic and english asking for help .

people are being asked what they think about the £ 425m thames gateway bridge linking beckton , in newham , east london to thamesmead , in greenwich , south-east london .
the crossing is part of the plans to redevelop the thames gateway , a 40-mile-wide area stretching from east and south-east london to kent and essex .
the bridge could be part-funded by tolls and mayor ken livingstone says it is possible it could mean the end of the free woolwich ferry service .
it is one of four new river crossings he says are necessary to bring investment , jobs and homes to the under-developed area .
and mr livingstone claims , by charging hgvs and long-distance traffic more to use the crossing , it is estimated that 90 % of traffic would be local .
but environmentalists say the plans are flawed and damaging , and will mean extra traffic and more pollution .
friends of the earth says the scheme will complete dual carriageways to the north and south of the river and will be used by businesses to transport more road freight .
if it is given the go-ahead , the bridge would be likely to open in 2010 .

people are being asked what they think about the £ 425m thames gateway bridge linking beckton , in newham , east london to thamesmead , in greenwich , south-east london .
the crossing is part of the plans to redevelop the thames gateway , a 40-mile-wide area stretching from east and south-east london to kent and essex .
the bridge could be part-funded by tolls and mayor ken livingstone says it is possible it could mean the end of the free woolwich ferry service .
it is one of four new river crossings he says are necessary to bring investment , jobs and homes to the under-developed area .
and mr livingstone claims , by charging hgvs and long-distance traffic more to use the crossing , it is estimated that 90 % of traffic would be local .
but environmentalists say the plans are flawed and damaging , and will mean extra traffic and more pollution .
friends of the earth says the scheme will complete dual carriageways to the north and south of the river and will be used by businesses to transport more road freight .

carissa lough from new zealand has just taken up her new job as windermere project officer for the lake district national park authority .
she will draw up a new strategy for the lake , within the scope of the forthcoming controversial 10mph speed regulations .
the four busiest areas of windermere have a 6mph limit , and from 29 march 2005 there will be a 10mph limit on the rest of the lake .
the move has angered water sports enthusiasts who have formed the windermere action force -lrb- waf -rrb- to put forward their case .
ms lough is an honours graduate in horticultural technology and business from massey university in new zealand , and has recently been teaching languages in birmingham .
visitor numbers prior to moving to the uk she worked for the new zealand fish and game council developing management plans for fish , lakes and the environment .
she said : " i 'm used to managing the issues of the environment and of how we use our lakes .
" some of the 13 lakes i looked after before were even larger than windermere - but none of them had the visitor numbers we have here .
that 's the big difference i 've noticed . "
one of her tasks will be to draw up a public discussion document about the lake .
she will also co-ordinate the activities of the joint windermere strategy group consisting of representatives of the national park authority and south lakeland district council .
local councillors and national park officials say the 10mph by-law is designed to stop fast power boats and jetskis taking over the famous inland water .

the university of plymouth has decided not to move students from its seale hayne campus , near newton abbot in south devon , to its central plymouth site .
the original decision to move students , announced in december 2002 , was met with strong opposition by students and the local farming community .
but the plans have been scrapped .
university bosses have now proposed the campus could become a rural centre of excellence .
seale hayne , which is set in the south devon countryside at bickington , has been a centre for agricultural studies since the 1920s .
these plans put forward do signal a real intent by the university to keep seale hayne jim hosking the university had said that because most science courses were based in plymouth , it made sense to centralise facilities and expertise and allow courses to be mixed with other disciplines .
but now it plans to turn the college into a rural centre of excellence which would include so-called " incubator units " to help start new businesses .
university deputy vice chancellor professor peter evans said of the new scheme : " we think this proposal is true to the spirit that was shown when seale-hayne was established .
" the economy has changed and the training needs have changed , but we want to establish a centre that builds on the strengths of seale-hayne and ensure that it provides leadership and vision for the future of the rural economy . "
economy boost former seale-hayne governor jim hosking welcomes what he says is an attempt to diversify the college .
he said : " these plans put forward do signal a real intent by the university to keep seale hayne and build it up to make it vibrant and viable in this region . "
teignbridge district council member stuart barker said the move was a boost for the local economy .
" hopefully , it will include some additional buildings which will be the incubator units which the university is talking about .
" these will be new business and they will enable the students who are taught there and get their degrees there to then find employment opportunities in the area , which will add long-term benefits to the local economy which are currently not there . "

the university of plymouth has decided not to move students from its seale hayne campus , near newton abbot in south devon , to its central plymouth site .
the original decision to move students , announced in december 2002 , was met with strong opposition by students and the local farming community .

university bosses have now proposed the campus could become a rural centre of excellence .

these plans put forward do signal a real intent by the university to keep seale hayne jim hosking the university had said that because most science courses were based in plymouth , it made sense to centralise facilities and expertise and allow courses to be mixed with other disciplines .

university deputy vice chancellor professor peter evans said of the new scheme : " we think this proposal is true to the spirit that was shown when seale-hayne was established .
" the economy has changed and the training needs have changed , but we want to establish a centre that builds on the strengths of seale-hayne and ensure that it provides leadership and vision for the future of the rural economy . "

he said : " these plans put forward do signal a real intent by the university to keep seale hayne and build it up to make it vibrant and viable in this region . "
teignbridge district council member stuart barker said the move was a boost for the local economy .
" hopefully , it will include some additional buildings which will be the incubator units which the university is talking about .
" these will be new business and they will enable the students who are taught there and get their degrees there to then find employment opportunities in the area , which will add long-term benefits to the local economy which are currently not there . "
