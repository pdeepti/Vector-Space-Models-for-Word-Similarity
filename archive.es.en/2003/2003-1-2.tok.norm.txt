dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .
those are the fact , and we will continue our relationship on time honoured and good footing and do our best to make sure things get even better , " he said .
the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .
germany 's international commitments could improve ties things mildly improved end of september .
germany was voted in as a non-permanent member of the u.n. security council for a two year term .
germany received 180 out of 183 allocated votes .
the u.s also gave germany its vote .
it was , as u.s. ambassador james cunningham said after the vote , an " obvious " decision .
the broad agreement in the u.n. general assembly was also a result of the fact that germany had increased its commitments in peace operations .
with almost 10,000 soldiers , germany provides the second largest overall contingent .
and from march 1st , 2003 , germany will be co-leading the isaf security force in afghanistan- a concession to the usa that should help defuse german-american tensions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .

dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .
those are the fact , and we will continue our relationship on time honoured and good footing and do our best to make sure things get even better , " he said .
the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .
germany 's international commitments could improve ties things mildly improved end of september .
germany was voted in as a non-permanent member of the u.n. security council for a two year term .
germany received 180 out of 183 allocated votes .
the u.s also gave germany its vote .
it was , as u.s. ambassador james cunningham said after the vote , an " obvious " decision .
the broad agreement in the u.n. general assembly was also a result of the fact that germany had increased its commitments in peace operations .
with almost 10,000 soldiers , germany provides the second largest overall contingent .
and from march 1st , 2003 , germany will be co-leading the isaf security force in afghanistan- a concession to the usa that should help defuse german-american tensions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .
those are the fact , and we will continue our relationship on time honoured and good footing and do our best to make sure things get even better , " he said .
the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .
germany 's international commitments could improve ties things mildly improved end of september .
germany was voted in as a non-permanent member of the u.n. security council for a two year term .
germany received 180 out of 183 allocated votes .
the u.s also gave germany its vote .
it was , as u.s. ambassador james cunningham said after the vote , an " obvious " decision .
the broad agreement in the u.n. general assembly was also a result of the fact that germany had increased its commitments in peace operations .
with almost 10,000 soldiers , germany provides the second largest overall contingent .
and from march 1st , 2003 , germany will be co-leading the isaf security force in afghanistan- a concession to the usa that should help defuse german-american tensions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .
those are the fact , and we will continue our relationship on time honoured and good footing and do our best to make sure things get even better , " he said .
the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .
germany 's international commitments could improve ties things mildly improved end of september .
germany was voted in as a non-permanent member of the u.n. security council for a two year term .
germany received 180 out of 183 allocated votes .
the u.s also gave germany its vote .
it was , as u.s. ambassador james cunningham said after the vote , an " obvious " decision .
the broad agreement in the u.n. general assembly was also a result of the fact that germany had increased its commitments in peace operations .
with almost 10,000 soldiers , germany provides the second largest overall contingent .
and from march 1st , 2003 , germany will be co-leading the isaf security force in afghanistan- a concession to the usa that should help defuse german-american tensions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.01.2003 a turbulent year for german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocky relationship - u.s. president bush , left , with german chancellor schröder after the sept 11 attacks , ties between germany and america have been overshadowed by fundamental differences over tackling global terrorism .
dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .
those are the fact , and we will continue our relationship on time honoured and good footing and do our best to make sure things get even better , " he said .
the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .
germany 's international commitments could improve ties things mildly improved end of september .
germany was voted in as a non-permanent member of the u.n. security council for a two year term .
germany received 180 out of 183 allocated votes .
the u.s also gave germany its vote .
it was , as u.s. ambassador james cunningham said after the vote , an " obvious " decision .
the broad agreement in the u.n. general assembly was also a result of the fact that germany had increased its commitments in peace operations .
with almost 10,000 soldiers , germany provides the second largest overall contingent .
and from march 1st , 2003 , germany will be co-leading the isaf security force in afghanistan- a concession to the usa that should help defuse german-american tensions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

fischer reaffirms german position to the un current affairs -pipe- 02.01.2003 germany faces difficult year at u.n. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year , germany will be taking part in u.n. security council meetings .
germany has pledged to push for " cooperative solutions to conflicts " in its new role as a member of the u.n. security council .
could this necessitate a softening of its stance against an iraq war ? for german diplomats at germany 's permanent mission to the united nations , the daily trip to work at the u.n. headquarters in new york could n't be closer : the two buildings are only separated by one busy street . how close relations between berlin and new york will be and how germany 's new role as a temporary member on the security council team will affect these relations in the near future , however , in particular over the contentious issue of a military attack on iraq , remains to be seen . excellent german-u.n. relations germany is now serving on the u.n. security council team as a temporary member for the fourth time since it joined the united nations in 1973 .
since then , germany has built up a relationship with the u.n. which is viewed as seemless , if not downright excellent .
both u.n. general secretary kofi annan and german foreign minister joschka fischer are known to get on well , on both professional and private terms . most importantly , germany has become the third-largest contributor to the un , following the u.s. and japan , transferring around € 340 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- a year to fund u.n. peacekeeping missions , international conferences , and the international tribunal courts . in addition , germany has taken on a far more active role than in the early ' 70s , when it was invited to join the united nations , more than two decades after the end of wwii .
according to tono eitel , u.n. ambassador at the time , and meanwhile retired , " -lrb- at that time -rrb- we still stood under the beady eye of the four allied powers " . it was only after unification , that germany was regarded as a full , albeit temporary member . in the past years , eitel recalls , germany , regardless of the party on the country 's government , has adopted a common direction in its u.n. policies .
" we have only wanted to attract attention to our constructive cooperation .
i think that we have tried very hard in this direction and that we have achieved a certain success , " eitel says . balkans breakthrough it was due to the german participation in the un peacekeeping mission in bosnia that germany saw its breakthrough on the united nations stage , and was from then on regarded and treated as a reliable member . today , german troops are deployed in u.n. missions all over the world .
in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany has taken a leading role in the reconstruction of these countries under a u.n. mandate .
in addition , civilian germans work in the organisations ' numerous offices worldwide , in the u.n. headquarters in new york , and the international court of justice in the hague . although the german government appears to concentrate more on affairs concerning european union , as opposed to the united nations , fischer has repeatedly stressed the importance of the un as a worldwide operating institution combating terror , poverty and the effects of war . " -lrb- the united nations -rrb- is the only organization able to provide the frame in which injustice between rich and poor and a balance between different peoples , between all peoples and regions , global peace and a sustainable development can be achieved , " he said . for fischer , the organisation 's power to act , and the strengthening of this power , is a question of fate for humanity in the 21st century . still not a permanent member however , for former u.n. diplomats like eitel , it is still unclear why germany , despite its " constructive cooperation , " and repeated show of support for the u.n. , has still has not pushed for a permanent seat on the security council . instead , the german chancellor has adopted a more contained stance on this issue .
according to gerhard schröder , " we are not standing on the mat and jostling -lrb- to get in -rrb- .
instead we are dealing very calmly with it , without doubting our political beliefs . " the iraq question indeed , there are more contentious issues on the agenda in the coming months - the most prominent of which will be a military attack on iraq , for which the us are stationing more and more troops in the golf region . as tension heightens over a possible war , the german government is finding itself in an increasing squeeze due to its new role on the security council and its pledge made in the pre-election campaign to not participate in a war on iraq . on tuesday , speaking to the nation in his new year 's speech , schröder indicated it was still open how germany would vote on the matter in the council , sparking fears that the chancellor may soften his anti-war stance among coalition ranks . schröder 's speech followed remarks made by foreign minister joschka fischer in an interview in the newsweekly spiegel last weekend .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . " on sunday , the social democratic party 's spokesman for foreign affairs , hans-ulrich klose , said he could n't imagine germany " pulling back " against a collective decision to act against iraq on the security council . " i ca n't imagine that happening - it would be a setback for germany 's position in the world , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .
those are the fact , and we will continue our relationship on time honoured and good footing and do our best to make sure things get even better , " he said .
the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .
germany 's international commitments could improve ties things mildly improved end of september .
germany was voted in as a non-permanent member of the u.n. security council for a two year term .
germany received 180 out of 183 allocated votes .
the u.s also gave germany its vote .
it was , as u.s. ambassador james cunningham said after the vote , an " obvious " decision .
the broad agreement in the u.n. general assembly was also a result of the fact that germany had increased its commitments in peace operations .
with almost 10,000 soldiers , germany provides the second largest overall contingent .
and from march 1st , 2003 , germany will be co-leading the isaf security force in afghanistan- a concession to the usa that should help defuse german-american tensions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .

fischer reaffirms german position to the un current affairs -pipe- 02.01.2003 germany faces difficult year at u.n. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year , germany will be taking part in u.n. security council meetings .
germany has pledged to push for " cooperative solutions to conflicts " in its new role as a member of the u.n. security council .
could this necessitate a softening of its stance against an iraq war ? for german diplomats at germany 's permanent mission to the united nations , the daily trip to work at the u.n. headquarters in new york could n't be closer : the two buildings are only separated by one busy street . how close relations between berlin and new york will be and how germany 's new role as a temporary member on the security council team will affect these relations in the near future , however , in particular over the contentious issue of a military attack on iraq , remains to be seen . excellent german-u.n. relations germany is now serving on the u.n. security council team as a temporary member for the fourth time since it joined the united nations in 1973 .
since then , germany has built up a relationship with the u.n. which is viewed as seemless , if not downright excellent .
both u.n. general secretary kofi annan and german foreign minister joschka fischer are known to get on well , on both professional and private terms . most importantly , germany has become the third-largest contributor to the un , following the u.s. and japan , transferring around € 340 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- a year to fund u.n. peacekeeping missions , international conferences , and the international tribunal courts . in addition , germany has taken on a far more active role than in the early ' 70s , when it was invited to join the united nations , more than two decades after the end of wwii .
according to tono eitel , u.n. ambassador at the time , and meanwhile retired , " -lrb- at that time -rrb- we still stood under the beady eye of the four allied powers " . it was only after unification , that germany was regarded as a full , albeit temporary member . in the past years , eitel recalls , germany , regardless of the party on the country 's government , has adopted a common direction in its u.n. policies .
" we have only wanted to attract attention to our constructive cooperation .
i think that we have tried very hard in this direction and that we have achieved a certain success , " eitel says . balkans breakthrough it was due to the german participation in the un peacekeeping mission in bosnia that germany saw its breakthrough on the united nations stage , and was from then on regarded and treated as a reliable member . today , german troops are deployed in u.n. missions all over the world .
in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany has taken a leading role in the reconstruction of these countries under a u.n. mandate .
in addition , civilian germans work in the organisations ' numerous offices worldwide , in the u.n. headquarters in new york , and the international court of justice in the hague . although the german government appears to concentrate more on affairs concerning european union , as opposed to the united nations , fischer has repeatedly stressed the importance of the un as a worldwide operating institution combating terror , poverty and the effects of war . " -lrb- the united nations -rrb- is the only organization able to provide the frame in which injustice between rich and poor and a balance between different peoples , between all peoples and regions , global peace and a sustainable development can be achieved , " he said . for fischer , the organisation 's power to act , and the strengthening of this power , is a question of fate for humanity in the 21st century . still not a permanent member however , for former u.n. diplomats like eitel , it is still unclear why germany , despite its " constructive cooperation , " and repeated show of support for the u.n. , has still has not pushed for a permanent seat on the security council . instead , the german chancellor has adopted a more contained stance on this issue .
according to gerhard schröder , " we are not standing on the mat and jostling -lrb- to get in -rrb- .
instead we are dealing very calmly with it , without doubting our political beliefs . " the iraq question indeed , there are more contentious issues on the agenda in the coming months - the most prominent of which will be a military attack on iraq , for which the us are stationing more and more troops in the golf region . as tension heightens over a possible war , the german government is finding itself in an increasing squeeze due to its new role on the security council and its pledge made in the pre-election campaign to not participate in a war on iraq . on tuesday , speaking to the nation in his new year 's speech , schröder indicated it was still open how germany would vote on the matter in the council , sparking fears that the chancellor may soften his anti-war stance among coalition ranks . schröder 's speech followed remarks made by foreign minister joschka fischer in an interview in the newsweekly spiegel last weekend .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . " on sunday , the social democratic party 's spokesman for foreign affairs , hans-ulrich klose , said he could n't imagine germany " pulling back " against a collective decision to act against iraq on the security council . " i ca n't imagine that happening - it would be a setback for germany 's position in the world , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?

dw-radio looks at how this has determined german foreign policy in 2002 . " this is a declaration of war against the entire civilized world .
i have assured american president george bush of germany ’ s absolute solidarity . "
that was german chancellor gerhard schröder after september 11th , 2001 .
in the weeks after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , the german government expressed absolute support for the united states .
germany buries difference with u.s. to fight terror major sticking points between the two countries such as the u.s. refusal to agree to the kyoto protocol or washington ’ s plans for a missile defense system were swept aside as the war against terrorism became the prime objective .
a joint manhunt began for those thought to be responsible for the attacks- primarily osama bin laden ’ s al kaida network and the taliban in afghanistan in the following months germany not only morally , but also materially supported u.s. efforts to pacify afghanistan .
in november 2001 , the german government hosted the conference on the future of the war-torn country .
when , on january 1st , 2002 , an advance team from the international security force , isaf , was sent to kabul , the german government supplied 200 troops , making it the largest contingent .
us-president george bush commended german chancellor gerhard schröder during a visit to the white house in early 2002 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and his wife first lady laura bush " i am very happy with germany ’ s co-operation .
they have sent troops to afghanistan , and according to my military reports , have done an excellent job .
i congratulate the chancellor also on a successful afghanistan conference in bonn . "
" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .
but he also made clear that bush ’ s concerns about the country were legitimate .
" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "
but german foreign minister joschka fisher was more outspoken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " we ’ re conducting an open discussion among partners and friends .
we need to realize that the usa has a different outlook on things than we do as europeans. vice versa , the usa must understand , that our view of some things is different . "
president bush floors germany with conciliatory speech in may this year , the u.s. president came to europe in order smooth ruffled feathers after his comments about the axis of evil .
in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "
chancellor schröder also commended the president .
" i think that we just witnessed a very important speech .
the speech clearly disproved the preconceptions of american politics and the president . "
icc another stumbling block in u.s.-german ties but the truce between the two countries was short-lived .
fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .
fischer snubbed by washington foreign minister fischer attempted to pour oil on troubled waters .
" the u.s. isn ’ t just for us , but also for other european countries , the most important partner outside of europe .
we will never forget that the liberation from national socialism was only possible with assistance from the usa , the oldest democracy .
we will never forget that german unification- a peaceful and free re-unification- very much depended on the involvement of the american president .
those are the fact , and we will continue our relationship on time honoured and good footing and do our best to make sure things get even better , " he said .
the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .
germany 's international commitments could improve ties things mildly improved end of september .
germany was voted in as a non-permanent member of the u.n. security council for a two year term .
germany received 180 out of 183 allocated votes .
the u.s also gave germany its vote .
it was , as u.s. ambassador james cunningham said after the vote , an " obvious " decision .
the broad agreement in the u.n. general assembly was also a result of the fact that germany had increased its commitments in peace operations .
with almost 10,000 soldiers , germany provides the second largest overall contingent .
and from march 1st , 2003 , germany will be co-leading the isaf security force in afghanistan- a concession to the usa that should help defuse german-american tensions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" axis of evil " speech estranges germany but despite the harmony between america and germany during chancellor schröder ’ s visit , president bush ’ s controversial state of the union address in january this year where he referred to " axis of evil " which included north korea , iran and iraq marred relations once again .
germany , along with several other european countries became wary of the u.s. stance to extend the war against terrorism to iraq .
there were fears that the u.s. would use the terrorist attacks as a pretext to declare war on all unfavorable regimes .
furthermore , america ’ s european allies were worried that a strike against iraq would provoke other arab countries to leave the already unsteady anti-terror coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder chancellor schröder was critical of washington ’ s plans for a military strike against iraq .

" it is justified and reasonable to put pressure on iraq and sadam hussein ’ s government , so that he complies with us demands : that is to allow inspectors into the country in order to check if weapons of mass destruction are being produced .
that is what the american president meant , and i share his views . "

in his speech to the german parliament bush said that despite the differences between europe and the usa , both groups defended " the same house of freedom . "
and he warned against underestimating international terrorist organizations and those regimes such as iraq , which harbored them .
bush apparently found the words to assuage german worries of u.s. unilateralism .
german foreign minister fischer spoke of the us president ’ s " completely new tone . "

fresh differences broke out in the middle of the year over the international criminal court or the icc .
on july first , the statute for the icc was scheduled to come into effect .
the u.n.-sponsored project was supported by all european countries , but along with those of china and russia , the u.s. ’ s signature was missing .
earlier in the year , the 60th member state had ratified the statute .
u.s. president bush had tried , with a symbolic gesture , to stop the treaty from entering into force by nullifying former u.s. president bill clinton ’ s existing signature .
bush reasoned that countries , who were hostile toward america , could manipulate the icc .
he feared that after military action in iraq , charges could be brought against u.s. soldiers at the court in the hague .
bosnian mandate poses new dilemma to germany that summer when the extension of the u.n. mandate for bosnia was back on the table , the u.s. used its veto in the security council in order to guarantee immunity for its citizens at the hague tribunal .
that presented an additional problem for the government in berlin : the deployment of 1,500 german soldiers for the sfor peace keeping troops was at stake .
the squabble within the security council over the extension of the u.n. mandate lasted over two weeks .
the dispute ended with a compromise : u.s soldiers under u.n. deployment were granted limited immunity and the u.n. ’ s bosnian mandate was extended another six months .
germany wary of america 's strident tone but the irritation over the american government ’ s attitude still remained .
moreover , president bush stepped up his threats against iraq , vowing to overthrow sadam hussein .
the german government now saw their hope that president bush would take a softer stance disappointed .
there was also a mood swing within the german population .
at the same time , the german elections were reaching their high point .
german chancellor schröder , in an effort to sway pacifist voters made the iraq question a central plank of his election platform in september .
" in certain existential questions , there is only one obvious answer- and there ’ s no way to avoid the issue : i am against a military intervention in iraq .
and under my leadership , germany will not take part in such action . "
comment by german minister worsens situation however , schröder ’ s rejection of military strikes against iraq , seen by his critics as populist electioneering , wasn ’ t the only event that caused commotion in washington .
a german newspaper article in september claimed that the german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin had compared us-president bush to hitler .
she denied the allegation but the u.s. government was outraged .
as a consequence , herta däubler-gmelin lost her post as justice minister .

the white house however turned a cold shoulder to fischer ’ s overtures : it didn ’ t send a good luck telegram to schröder for his election victory , an otherwise customary gesture .

fischer reaffirms german position to the un current affairs -pipe- 02.01.2003 germany faces difficult year at u.n. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year , germany will be taking part in u.n. security council meetings .
germany has pledged to push for " cooperative solutions to conflicts " in its new role as a member of the u.n. security council .
could this necessitate a softening of its stance against an iraq war ? for german diplomats at germany 's permanent mission to the united nations , the daily trip to work at the u.n. headquarters in new york could n't be closer : the two buildings are only separated by one busy street . how close relations between berlin and new york will be and how germany 's new role as a temporary member on the security council team will affect these relations in the near future , however , in particular over the contentious issue of a military attack on iraq , remains to be seen . excellent german-u.n. relations germany is now serving on the u.n. security council team as a temporary member for the fourth time since it joined the united nations in 1973 .
since then , germany has built up a relationship with the u.n. which is viewed as seemless , if not downright excellent .
both u.n. general secretary kofi annan and german foreign minister joschka fischer are known to get on well , on both professional and private terms . most importantly , germany has become the third-largest contributor to the un , following the u.s. and japan , transferring around € 340 million -lrb- $ 346 million -rrb- a year to fund u.n. peacekeeping missions , international conferences , and the international tribunal courts . in addition , germany has taken on a far more active role than in the early ' 70s , when it was invited to join the united nations , more than two decades after the end of wwii .

in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany has taken a leading role in the reconstruction of these countries under a u.n. mandate .
in addition , civilian germans work in the organisations ' numerous offices worldwide , in the u.n. headquarters in new york , and the international court of justice in the hague . although the german government appears to concentrate more on affairs concerning european union , as opposed to the united nations , fischer has repeatedly stressed the importance of the un as a worldwide operating institution combating terror , poverty and the effects of war . " -lrb- the united nations -rrb- is the only organization able to provide the frame in which injustice between rich and poor and a balance between different peoples , between all peoples and regions , global peace and a sustainable development can be achieved , " he said . for fischer , the organisation 's power to act , and the strengthening of this power , is a question of fate for humanity in the 21st century . still not a permanent member however , for former u.n. diplomats like eitel , it is still unclear why germany , despite its " constructive cooperation , " and repeated show of support for the u.n. , has still has not pushed for a permanent seat on the security council . instead , the german chancellor has adopted a more contained stance on this issue .
according to gerhard schröder , " we are not standing on the mat and jostling -lrb- to get in -rrb- .
instead we are dealing very calmly with it , without doubting our political beliefs . " the iraq question indeed , there are more contentious issues on the agenda in the coming months - the most prominent of which will be a military attack on iraq , for which the us are stationing more and more troops in the golf region . as tension heightens over a possible war , the german government is finding itself in an increasing squeeze due to its new role on the security council and its pledge made in the pre-election campaign to not participate in a war on iraq . on tuesday , speaking to the nation in his new year 's speech , schröder indicated it was still open how germany would vote on the matter in the council , sparking fears that the chancellor may soften his anti-war stance among coalition ranks . schröder 's speech followed remarks made by foreign minister joschka fischer in an interview in the newsweekly spiegel last weekend .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . " on sunday , the social democratic party 's spokesman for foreign affairs , hans-ulrich klose , said he could n't imagine germany " pulling back " against a collective decision to act against iraq on the security council .

this would make it only the third country to put humans into space .
shanghai aerospace centre director yuan jie said the project had already entered the overall assembly and testing phase .
the space programme is a source of pride in china the launch would take place in the second half of 2003 , he told the semi-official china news service .
china has already launched spacecraft designed to carry people .
the fourth such launch , of the shenzhou-iv spacecraft , took place on monday .
president jiang zemin hailed it as a " great victory " .
the bbc 's holly williams in beijing says that just like the american or russian space programmes 40 years ago , china 's efforts to put a man into space are as much about national pride as it is about science .
to boldly go in april , shenzhou iii carried out a successful week-long flight , with a module landing safely back on earth .
to distinguish them from russian cosmonauts and american astronauts , china uses the term " taikonauts " for its would-be space crews , deriving from the word " taikong " meaning space .
shenzhou iii returned to earth safely in april it is understood that about a dozen fighter pilots are training to become taikonauts , although there have been conflicting reports about how many have been chosen and where they are undergoing their training .
plans to build a moon base by 2010 and a space station were also reported last year , but some of these claims have since been denied .
success so far shenzhou iv has all the facilities necessary for manned flight , and the xinhua news agency reported that taikonauts had been training in the module , which can accommodate three people .
the first test flight of the shenzhou programme was in november 1999 , when a capsule orbited the earth 14 times in a 12-hour mission aimed at testing launch and re-entry systems .
shenzhou ii , launched in january 2001 , circled the earth 108 times and tested life support systems - it put a monkey , a dog , a rabbit and snails into orbit .
it returned nearly a week later to a press blackout that left western analysts suspecting a re-entry failure .
the chinese authorities denied this .
shenzhou is modelled on russian space technology , but with wide-ranging modifications by chinese engineers .
at least two taikonauts have been sent to russia for training , although china has released few details about the personnel involved in project 921 , as the space programme is known .
shenzhou means " divine vessel " in chinese . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's holly williams " the chinese government feels the need to put a chinese man into space " see also : 30 dec 02 -pipe- science / nature china launches new space mission 21 may 02 -pipe- science / nature china denies manned moon mission plans 06 dec 02 -pipe- science / nature space dream for chinese science 14 jan 03 -pipe- science / nature china hatches space chickens internet links : china academy of launch vehicle technology nasa the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

police stopped the former supremes star after a motorist called to report a swerving vehicle in the western state of arizona .
police officer scott sullivan in his report , released on tuesday , said he stopped ross after someone reported a vehicle was driving south in northbound lanes .
his report said he stopped ross at a video shop , where she had pulled into a space for disabled drivers .
she twice denied she had been drinking , and said she had been lost and was " just trying to get here to rent a video " .
no comment a breath test indicated that ms ross had more than twice the legal limit of alcohol in her system , police said .
a publicist for the singer refused to comment .
the report also said ross agreed to a sobriety test but fell down and laughed while trying to stand on one leg and count to ten .
in another test , it said , she missed a couple of letters and doubled others when asked to write the alphabet .
she is due to appear in court on 13 january on three misdemeanour charges .
earlier this year , she checked into a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre in california before the start of a summer tour .
ross first found fame with the supremes after neighbour smokey robinson arranged contact with legendary motown records .
the group scored hits with where did our love go ? , stop in the name of love and my world is empty without you before ross found renewed fame as a solo artist in the 1970s .
hits like ai n't no mountain high enough were followed by a 1980s revival with chain reaction .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- viewpoint : the arab cost of war news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : middle east news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help languages editions change to uk thursday , 2 january , 2003 , 07:25 gmt viewpoint : the arab cost of war bbc news online has asked a range of contributors to comment on the iraq crisis .
here , professor shibley telhami argues that in the aftermath of a possible war , the middle east would be more repressive and unstable than it is today .
arab public opinion is passionately opposed to the war , but it is going to be very difficult for arab governments to be opposed in a significant and meaningful way .
therefore , they have two choices - to support the war or appear to be relatively neutral .
governments are essentially unleashing their security forces to make arrests and to ensure that no one organises any significant opposition the only way to maintain their course and prevent public discontent is to be more repressive .
we can see this already .
most people in the region believe war has become inevitable , and governments are essentially unleashing their security forces to make arrests and to ensure that no one organises any significant opposition .
the governments feel more vulnerable this time than during the last gulf war because they do not have full control of the media .
a decade ago , you could argue that they had a near monopoly on the media and used this to shape public opinion and reduce the level of anger .
but now , because of trans-national television - the al-jazeera phenomenon and the cnn phenomenon - it is harder for the governments to sell only one side of the story .
they are feeling less secure , but i do n't think this means there will be a revolution - revolutions are scarce in the middle east .
the regimes will be successful this time around , but the cost of that success will be more repression , at least in the short term .
click here to send your comments i do n't doubt that america is interested in democracy in the middle east - in fact its interest might be stronger today than ever .
previously , the us followed a policy that broadly overlooked what governments in the region did internally , as long as ultimately they supported the us .
but , there is now an increasing awareness that what happens inside does matter .
many americans believe that what happened on 11 september was a function of that system .
there will be more terrorist attacks and america is going to need a lot of regional support for the war on terror so in that sense , it is true that there is an american interest in seeing a profound change in the region .
but the problem is going to be america 's ability to make that a priority given the vital interests at stake .
immediately after an overthrow of the iraqi regime , the big issue for america will be staying in iraq if it wants a say in what happens next .
it will probably have to leave a force of about 75,000 troops over an extended period of time .
a lot of economic and political resources will have to be brought to bear to ensure a unified and stable iraq .
us priorities it will have to put a lot of effort in place to govern a state where there will be competing interests - north-south , ethnic , religious , supporters of the regime , opponents of the regime , the revenge factor .
america will have its priorities .
first it will have to safeguard the lives of american troops .
second , it will need to assure the flow of oil at reasonable prices - no matter what happens in the iraqi oil fields , it will take a while to drive up the production in iraq , so the us is going to need the help of regional oil producers .
and third , it is likely there will be more terrorist attacks and america is going to need a lot of regional support for the war on terror .
whose security forces and intelligence services do you need to fight that war ?
those of the democratic forces on the street or those of the government ?
the us will desperately need the cooperation of the governments of the region .
finally , to achieve its objective of ensuring a favourable outcome in iraq , america will have to deal with iraq 's neighbours - turkey , syria , jordan and iran have vital interests in iraq , perhaps more vital that america 's .
they are not going to stand on the sidelines .
and america wo n't want them to become a menace to its policy in iraq , so they will have the capacity to affect the outcome .
given all of that , democracy will be a lower priority after the war .
shibley telhami is anwar sadat professor for peace and development at the university of maryland and a senior fellow at the washington-based brookings institution .
he is also author of the stakes : america and the middle east .
professor telhami was talking to kathryn westcott .
send us your comments : name : your e-mail address : country : comments : disclaimer : the bbc will put up as many of your comments as possible but we can not guarantee that all e-mails will be published .
the bbc reserves the right to edit comments that are published .
every middle-eastern desires to have a democratic rule in his country , but achieving democracy must come from inside these countries and not imposed by foreigners .
the us faces a big dilemma here - it says it wants democratic regimes in the middle-east , but it knows that the moment the people get a democratic government , us forces will be ousted from their countries due to the escalating anti-american feeling .
john talhami , uk i absolutely agree with mr telhami 's comment , except for the idea might want to help democracy in the region .
the us will never do that. fahad , saudi arabia the oppressive regimes that now rule most of the middle east will do bush 's bidding because they are and have been fully supported by the us government .
two clear proofs of this theory can be found in the us 's attitude towards nasser of egypt and dr mossadeq of iran , both of whom took power in the 50s .
these leaders were , if anything , too democratic for the us government because they wanted to nationalise their countries ' resources .
in both cases the us worked aggressively to put these countries back in the hand of their puppet dictators and in different degrees they succeeded in both accounts .
paul , canada the people of iraq are suffering under saddam 's regime but the rest of the arab world would rather go to war against america than support the liberation of the iraqi people , what is wrong with them ?
michael pearce , uk the last thing america wants is democracy in the middle east , so let 's stop pulling out the democracy card , the public is not naive .
a democratic middle east would see the islamists gain power as they have successfully done in turkey and pakistan .
fundamental islam would once again be implemented throughout the arabian peninsular and beyond , with the islamists controlling the largest known oil reserves in the world .
is this what america wants ?
james , uk all this talk of democracy in the middle east , yet western leaders pay no attention to the millions of their citizens clamouring for peace .
why does the word of one foreigner -lrb- bush -rrb- mean more to tony blair than the voices of millions of british citizens ?
j. gomer , wales , uk this war is about one thing .
that one thing is american interests - and in particular oil .
it 's plain to see that america will have to make much effort in a post-saddam iraq to secure its interests .
war in iraq will add to the already dreadful image of america in the middle east and will go one step further to destabilising the region .
the muslims in the middle east want regime change , so that they can challenge western foreign policy , which makes the west rich at the expense of others ifty , uk i do n't doubt that many in the us and in the west in general are genuine in their wishes to see democracy in the middle east .
however , there 's no indication that democratically elected governments would be more favourably inclined towards the western world .
hans kristian , norway it is these oppressive regimes and the lack of democracy in the middle east , that has led to the large support that al-qaeda " enjoys " in arab countries .
the regimes have failed their people in every way , and the people have suffered the worse human rights abuses .
as all legitimate opposition has been destroyed , the only people remaining are the islamic fundamentalists .
therefore , many people who would otherwise never think of supporting fundamentalism , now find it to be the only alternative .
therefore , the best way to win this war on terror would be to have full democratic and human rights in the arab world .
muneer , united kingdom few understand the military-political implications of an attack on iraq .
such an attack would : send a warning to all regimes that openly defy the us ; divide iran from syria , making it more difficult for hezbollah to operate ; eliminate a major threat to the security of it 's closest regional ally , israel and guarantee strategic oil supplies from the mid-east .
from a geo-political viewpoint , these 4 reasons are rational and outweigh the usual objections .
they show why bush and blair will attack iraq .
" weapons of mass destruction " or " democracy " have nothing to do with it .
isabel treece , usa the war against iraq is inevitable simply because george w wants to wrap up his father 's unfinished business over there .
if it had anything to do with the war against terrorism , the us would be attacking saudi arabia .
fifteen of the 19 terrorists who died on 9/11 were saudis , osama bin laden is a saudi , al quaeda is supported by saudi money .
however , because of the oil interest the us prefers to turn a blind eye to those facts and to the actions of the ruling regime in one of the world 's most repressive countries - so much for supporting democracy .
stu , uk there is no doubt that promoting democracy in the middle east , with or without toppling saddam , will be fiendishly difficult .
nevertheless , we must do it .
even if one utterly rejects idealistic motives , it is the most practical long term solution to the current problems .
certainly , if we push democracy , things will get more difficult , and possibly worse , before they start getting better .
but if we do not push democracy , they will just keep getting worse forever. hank thayer , usa / japan the removal of saddam hussein 's brutal regime would be good for the people of iraq and for stability in the region - but only if it can be guaranteed that democracy can replace the power vacuum immediately .
i am also suspicious of the policy of befriending one repressive regime , such as that in saudi arabia and kuwait , to eliminate another .
supporting democracy in all middle eastern countries is the only way to end terrorist actions .
ahmed desai , united kingdom the only democracy in the whole region is israel .
at the beginning of the year , it was clear that attempts were made to secure peace between israel and the palestinians in order for the focus on iraq to remain .
that fact is , however , that arab governments are happy for the conflict to drag on so that the attention of their own populations is taken off repression and poverty at home and instead focused on the israeli / palestinian issue .
the us should be seen as actively engaging in the middle east process in order to demonstrate that its interests are best served by peace in the whole region , and not by on-going conflicts .
suki singh , uk true , the immediate costs of war , in the middle east will only prove to many arabs that the us is only interested in oil exports of the region , more specifically those controlled by saddam .
but removing him from power and trying to establish a new government could very well be successful as long as the un supports and protects the interests of iraq and its people and not just those of any western nation looking for a new opec ally .
we have seen that setting up a fledgling government in a turbulent islamic nation has had mixed success , i.e. afghanistan .
in that case , though , it appeared that the us tried to allow the afghan people to decide their own fate and allow them to work out their own politics .
i fear that in the case of iraq , the us will be much more involved in any elections and establishment of government .
after all , the united states is heavily dependent on oil , and having sway over a large oil producer will indeed aid the ailing us economy .
iraq , once liberated and stabilised should be left by itself to work out its own system .
democracy should be brought to iraq , but not by an invading power , but by the un .
jeremy nelson , united states it is imprecise to label the arab world " unstable " and professor tilhami says just that , " revolutions are uncommon " .
syria and morocco have been ruled by the same clan for two generations , jordan for three , saudi arabia for one and a half -lrb- since all of the rulers since abdelaziz have been half brothers -rrb- .
egypt , has been ruled by the same political party since the overthrow of the anaemic monarchy 50 years ago .
the only place where there is instability is algeria , where a ruling junta , with tacit western support , has refused to hand over the power it lost in a fair election .
the label " unstable " is a fiction perpetrated by those unfriendly to arabs as such for their opposition to the state of israel .
the conventional myth is that of beleaguered israel as a stable democracy in a sea of instability .
the reality is that israel has been governed by deadlocked minority coalitions for a generation or longer .
the arab states are if anything too stabile .
david wilmsen , egypt would n't the us win favour with its arab allies if it gave them the peace-keeper role in iraq once saddam had been ousted - much the same way as they did with turkey in afghanistan .

in both cases the us worked aggressively to put these countries back in the hand of their puppet dictators and in different degrees they succeeded in both accounts .
paul , canada the people of iraq are suffering under saddam 's regime but the rest of the arab world would rather go to war against america than support the liberation of the iraqi people , what is wrong with them ?
michael pearce , uk the last thing america wants is democracy in the middle east , so let 's stop pulling out the democracy card , the public is not naive .
a democratic middle east would see the islamists gain power as they have successfully done in turkey and pakistan .
fundamental islam would once again be implemented throughout the arabian peninsular and beyond , with the islamists controlling the largest known oil reserves in the world .
is this what america wants ?
james , uk all this talk of democracy in the middle east , yet western leaders pay no attention to the millions of their citizens clamouring for peace .
why does the word of one foreigner -lrb- bush -rrb- mean more to tony blair than the voices of millions of british citizens ?
j. gomer , wales , uk this war is about one thing .
that one thing is american interests - and in particular oil .
it 's plain to see that america will have to make much effort in a post-saddam iraq to secure its interests .
war in iraq will add to the already dreadful image of america in the middle east and will go one step further to destabilising the region .
the muslims in the middle east want regime change , so that they can challenge western foreign policy , which makes the west rich at the expense of others ifty , uk i do n't doubt that many in the us and in the west in general are genuine in their wishes to see democracy in the middle east .
however , there 's no indication that democratically elected governments would be more favourably inclined towards the western world .
hans kristian , norway it is these oppressive regimes and the lack of democracy in the middle east , that has led to the large support that al-qaeda " enjoys " in arab countries .
the regimes have failed their people in every way , and the people have suffered the worse human rights abuses .
as all legitimate opposition has been destroyed , the only people remaining are the islamic fundamentalists .
therefore , many people who would otherwise never think of supporting fundamentalism , now find it to be the only alternative .
therefore , the best way to win this war on terror would be to have full democratic and human rights in the arab world .
muneer , united kingdom few understand the military-political implications of an attack on iraq .
such an attack would : send a warning to all regimes that openly defy the us ; divide iran from syria , making it more difficult for hezbollah to operate ; eliminate a major threat to the security of it 's closest regional ally , israel and guarantee strategic oil supplies from the mid-east .
from a geo-political viewpoint , these 4 reasons are rational and outweigh the usual objections .
they show why bush and blair will attack iraq .
" weapons of mass destruction " or " democracy " have nothing to do with it .
isabel treece , usa the war against iraq is inevitable simply because george w wants to wrap up his father 's unfinished business over there .
if it had anything to do with the war against terrorism , the us would be attacking saudi arabia .
fifteen of the 19 terrorists who died on 9/11 were saudis , osama bin laden is a saudi , al quaeda is supported by saudi money .
however , because of the oil interest the us prefers to turn a blind eye to those facts and to the actions of the ruling regime in one of the world 's most repressive countries - so much for supporting democracy .
stu , uk there is no doubt that promoting democracy in the middle east , with or without toppling saddam , will be fiendishly difficult .
nevertheless , we must do it .
even if one utterly rejects idealistic motives , it is the most practical long term solution to the current problems .
certainly , if we push democracy , things will get more difficult , and possibly worse , before they start getting better .
but if we do not push democracy , they will just keep getting worse forever. hank thayer , usa / japan the removal of saddam hussein 's brutal regime would be good for the people of iraq and for stability in the region - but only if it can be guaranteed that democracy can replace the power vacuum immediately .
i am also suspicious of the policy of befriending one repressive regime , such as that in saudi arabia and kuwait , to eliminate another .
supporting democracy in all middle eastern countries is the only way to end terrorist actions .
ahmed desai , united kingdom the only democracy in the whole region is israel .
at the beginning of the year , it was clear that attempts were made to secure peace between israel and the palestinians in order for the focus on iraq to remain .
that fact is , however , that arab governments are happy for the conflict to drag on so that the attention of their own populations is taken off repression and poverty at home and instead focused on the israeli / palestinian issue .
the us should be seen as actively engaging in the middle east process in order to demonstrate that its interests are best served by peace in the whole region , and not by on-going conflicts .
suki singh , uk true , the immediate costs of war , in the middle east will only prove to many arabs that the us is only interested in oil exports of the region , more specifically those controlled by saddam .
but removing him from power and trying to establish a new government could very well be successful as long as the un supports and protects the interests of iraq and its people and not just those of any western nation looking for a new opec ally .
we have seen that setting up a fledgling government in a turbulent islamic nation has had mixed success , i.e. afghanistan .
in that case , though , it appeared that the us tried to allow the afghan people to decide their own fate and allow them to work out their own politics .
i fear that in the case of iraq , the us will be much more involved in any elections and establishment of government .
after all , the united states is heavily dependent on oil , and having sway over a large oil producer will indeed aid the ailing us economy .
iraq , once liberated and stabilised should be left by itself to work out its own system .
democracy should be brought to iraq , but not by an invading power , but by the un .
jeremy nelson , united states it is imprecise to label the arab world " unstable " and professor tilhami says just that , " revolutions are uncommon " .
syria and morocco have been ruled by the same clan for two generations , jordan for three , saudi arabia for one and a half -lrb- since all of the rulers since abdelaziz have been half brothers -rrb- .
egypt , has been ruled by the same political party since the overthrow of the anaemic monarchy 50 years ago .
the only place where there is instability is algeria , where a ruling junta , with tacit western support , has refused to hand over the power it lost in a fair election .
the label " unstable " is a fiction perpetrated by those unfriendly to arabs as such for their opposition to the state of israel .
the conventional myth is that of beleaguered israel as a stable democracy in a sea of instability .
the reality is that israel has been governed by deadlocked minority coalitions for a generation or longer .
the arab states are if anything too stabile .
david wilmsen , egypt would n't the us win favour with its arab allies if it gave them the peace-keeper role in iraq once saddam had been ousted - much the same way as they did with turkey in afghanistan .

the overall growth in prices across wales was the fastest for a decade , according to the principality building society .
cardiff was the major hotspot , with the average property price increase touching 20 % , rising from £ 93,000 to nearly £ 110,000 .
property increases in 2002 : an all-wales average increase : £ 71,804 to £ 83,246 -lrb- + 16.8 % -rrb- south east wales average : £ 78,628 to £ 92,464 -lrb- + 18.5 % -rrb- mid wales average : £ 74,386 to £ 85,923 -lrb- + 16.6 % -rrb- north wales average : £ 68,165 to £ 76,382 -lrb- + 13.1 % -rrb- west wales average £ 62,663 to £ 69,591 -lrb- + 11.4 % -rrb- but the situation elsewhere in the country showed strong regional variations , with a modest 10 % increase in bangor , up to £ 69,351 .
in newport , average prices went up to £ 80,193 -lrb- + 13.6 % -rrb- , £ 75,215 -lrb- + 11.1 % -rrb- in wrexham , £ 74,861 -lrb- + 12.4 % -rrb- in swansea .
the key factors in price increases in wales during 2002 were low interest rates for mortgages and high employment .
peter griffiths , chief executive of the principality building society , warned homeowners against anticipating further sharp price increases during 2003 , which is expected to show less dramatic rises .
" we remain very positive for the housing market in 2003 , " he said .
top prices in wales are still cheaper than london " however , i would caution home owners against the expectation that double-digit house price growth will continue into 2003 .
" it is pretty obvious that 16.8 % average growth is not a figure that can be sustained for any length of time . "
mr griffiths said one of the strongest trends noted in 2002 was the movement of first-time buyers away from property hotspots .
" pressure on affordable homes for first time buyers in cardiff , swansea and newport is having a knock-on effect on nearby travel-to-work towns and communities such as pontypridd , llanelli and cwmbran , " he explained .
