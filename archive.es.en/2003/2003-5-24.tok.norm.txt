sir david steel told the general assembly that all kirk members should make politicians aware of their anger .
he made the call in his closing speech at the assembly as lord high commissioner .
lord steel of aikwood said he had been " duty bound to have no views on anything " for the last four years because of his position on impartiality within the parliament .
but having stood down at the 1 may election , he told the assembly : " no longer . "
the members of the assembly had earlier heard how the kirk 's 30 care homes had run up a Â£ 5.7m deficit .
every single member of this assembly has an opportunity , a responsibility , indeed a duty to do something about it sir david steel the church has warned that some may have to close because of a lack of funds .
" the crisis in these care homes has become a national scandal , " said sir david .
he said that simply writing letters to the scottish executive or meeting cosla , the body which represents most scottish councils , was not enough .
" every single member of this assembly has an opportunity , a responsibility , indeed a duty to do something about it , " he said .
" you should contact your local councillor and own msp on return and acquaint them with the facts .
" you should make sure that every member of your kirk session , your presbytery , your congregation , does likewise .
" and do n't just write to them .
demand to see them , and if you do that , every elected representative in scotland at council and parliamentary level could , within a few weeks , be made aware not just of the facts , but of our concern and even anger . "

a special workshop has been set up in usk prison in south east wales so that inmates can remove the fake logos from clothing , cds and videos which have been seized by trading standards officers .
the st david 's foundation - a charity which specialises in providing palliative care - are behind the scheme and hope to sell the rebranded goods at their 12 shops in the region .
charity worker alan devonald said it was an excellent way of recycling goods which had been confiscated from the black market .
" it is the first scheme of its kind in wales and is a great way of utilising products that would otherwise have to be destroyed , " he said .
" not only are we recycling goods but we are able to make money for the charity .
it is a useful occupation for the prisoners who are very keen to be part of the project terry smith , usk prison " in many ways , these things are top of the range , obviously they are counterfeit but the quality of them is excellent .
by doing this we will also be able to provide a service of selling good quality clothes and goods cheaply , " he added .
six prisoners at the jail will work on the scheme under the supervision of prison officer terry smith .
" it is a useful occupation for the prisoners who are very keen to be part of the project , " said mr smith .
" they are very happy to do anything that helps charity .
" there is probably going to be more stuff than we can handle and we are still looking at the best methods to work with .
" we want to be able to make the counterfeit goods sellable by taking the fake trademarks off them , " he added .
large stock among the trading standards offices in the region supporting the project are blaenau gwent and monmouthshire .
richard prince , a senior fair trading officer at blaenau gwent council , said : " we have built up a very large stock of counterfeit goods which would otherwise have to be destroyed .
" the st david 's foundation asked to take the stock and recycle the goods so anything they can rebrand or relogo will be sent down to usk prison for the prisoners to rebrand .
" anything that can be recycled will be , for example perfume will be thrown away and the bottles recycled , and cds and videos will be blanked and sold on , " he said .
