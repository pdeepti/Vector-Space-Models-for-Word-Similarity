best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .
poland has already received pledges of troops from ukraine , bulgaria , denmark and norway . " we must find a way to enable us all to do our bit in building a new civil society in iraq , " german parliamentarian and member of the german-polish society , dietmar niethahn told deutsche welle . " and in that context i think it 's very important that poland gets support from nato .
and if nato gives poland help , germany as a nato member will be one of the countries to support them too .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .

" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .

the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .

farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .
however any change would first have to be approved by all eu finance ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.06.2003 schröder visits poland ahead of eu vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller wants poles to vote in favor of eu membership this weekend .
germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .
poland has already received pledges of troops from ukraine , bulgaria , denmark and norway . " we must find a way to enable us all to do our bit in building a new civil society in iraq , " german parliamentarian and member of the german-polish society , dietmar niethahn told deutsche welle . " and in that context i think it 's very important that poland gets support from nato .
and if nato gives poland help , germany as a nato member will be one of the countries to support them too .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .
however any change would first have to be approved by all eu finance ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .
poland has already received pledges of troops from ukraine , bulgaria , denmark and norway . " we must find a way to enable us all to do our bit in building a new civil society in iraq , " german parliamentarian and member of the german-polish society , dietmar niethahn told deutsche welle . " and in that context i think it 's very important that poland gets support from nato .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .
poland has already received pledges of troops from ukraine , bulgaria , denmark and norway . " we must find a way to enable us all to do our bit in building a new civil society in iraq , " german parliamentarian and member of the german-polish society , dietmar niethahn told deutsche welle . " and in that context i think it 's very important that poland gets support from nato .
and if nato gives poland help , germany as a nato member will be one of the countries to support them too .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .
however any change would first have to be approved by all eu finance ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .
however any change would first have to be approved by all eu finance ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .
the european commission is currently considering changes to the eu ’ s system of taxing cultural goods as part of a review of vat directives .
however any change would first have to be approved by all eu finance ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .
poland has already received pledges of troops from ukraine , bulgaria , denmark and norway . " we must find a way to enable us all to do our bit in building a new civil society in iraq , " german parliamentarian and member of the german-polish society , dietmar niethahn told deutsche welle . " and in that context i think it 's very important that poland gets support from nato .
and if nato gives poland help , germany as a nato member will be one of the countries to support them too .

best-selling european pop artists , among them elton john and eros ramazzotti , sign a petition demanding the eu lower value added tax on cds and put an end to what they decry as cultural discrimination against music . for years , compact discs in europe have been subjected to higher sales taxes , known here as value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , than books , movies and other cultural commodities .
with slumping sales and the increasing threat of piracy over the internet , musicians would like to see that changed .
a petition signed by 1,200 prominent european music artists and submitted to 20 european commissioners in brussels on tuesday by german songwriter rolf zuckowski and belgian pop star alex callier of the group hooverphonic claimed that disproportionately high taxes on recorded music within the european union are choking sales .
other signatories to the petition included international music giants andrea bocelli , elton john , julio iglesias , nana mouskouri , chris de burgh and johnny hallyday .
alleged discrimination the artists are demanding that their music be classified in accordance with other cultural products like books , newspapers or movie tickets , which are subject to lower taxes .
" it ’ s unjust that the state imposes higher taxes on cds and records than audio books or books , " zuckowski said .
" we have the most incredible range of music in europe , from scandinavian pop to german classical and british rock .
a vat reduction would protect europe ’ s cultural diversity and would give young musicians a chance again , " he said .
in germany , the 16 percent vat applies to cds and records , while so-called " socially necessary " cultural items such as books , magazines and movie tickets are only taxed by 7 percent .
the german model is standard practice in europe , which follows eu vat directives stipulating that vat rates on cds should be between 15 and 25 percent .
however , germany 's 16 percent vat rate is relatively low when compared to britain or scandinavia .
the british pay 17.5 percent of vat , while danes and swedes pay the maximum 25 percent .
belgian singer callier put the issue in perspective in an interview with the bbc .
" when someone buys a biography of jacques brel -lrb- legendary french singer -rrb- in belgium , he pays a vat rate of 6 percent , but if he buys a cd of his music , he has to pay 21 percent .
this makes no sense and does not recognize the cultural role of musical artists , " he said .
slashing vat could bolster struggling music industry a recent five-country survey for the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that vat reduction could significantly boost a music industry plagued by declining sales and widespread piracy .
the survey said 60 percent of people over the age of 16 would buy more cds if they were cheaper .
the survey also suggests that increased cd sales would compensate governments for any loss of revenue from a vat cut within one or two years .
the study also concluded that if vat was significantly lowered , italy could see a rise in music sales as high as 160 percent while britain could see sales jump to a whopping 110 percent .

germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .
but some polish farmers and catholics fear the country will lose its independence if it joins . german chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to poland on wednesday to bolster warsaw 's campaign for a " yes " vote in the country 's referendum on european union membership this weekend . while visiting the largest of the 10 eu accession states , which is home to 39 million , schröder is due to hold talks with polish prime minister leszek miller in the town of lodz and is also expected to join him on a pro-eu , get-out-the-vote tour . " i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of poles wo n't miss this historic chance , " schröder told journalists in lodz after meeting with miller .
poland did n't just need europe , but europe also needed poland with all its creative potential , he said . " it is a process of giving and taking , " schröder added , comparing poland 's accession to the eu and the aid the country will receive to the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .
" i am sure that european solidarity will help the polish people just as much . " tepid support among farmers though the latest polls show the majority of poles - 80 percent - are in favor of joining the european union , building support was a slow and arduous process , with both catholic church and farming lobbies until recently leading staunch campaigns against eu membership . for months , polish farmers were outraged by the fact that older eu member states like france and germany would get nearly double the agricultural subsidies from brussels that they were slated to receive - an imbalance that could lead to cheaper imports from the west that would undercut local farms . however , a poll released by the center for public research on monday indicated that the majority of farmers are now ready to support eu membership .
fifty-two percent of the farmers surveyed said they would vote in favor of accession on saturday and sunday . the farmers were n't alone in doubting the benefits of membership .
until recently , poland 's hugely powerful catholic church had also been campaigning against membership , fearing that eu entry would result in poland losing its ability to carve it 's own path on hot-button political issues like abortion . last year catholic church leader cardinal jozef glemp demanded that poland 's anti-abortion position be recognized by the eu when it joins in 2004 .
but his plea fell on deaf ears .
the left-leaning miller government , which favors legalization of abortion , ignored the issue when it negotiated its accession terms with brussels last year . catholic u-turn the catholic church recently eased its objections to eu membership after pope john paul ii came out in support of integration .
" europe needs poland , and poland needs europe , " he said on may 19 . the pope 's stance led the staunch-catholic station radio marya , which had long been part of the anti-eu campaign , to make a u-turn this week .
the station is now urging polish catholics to follow vatican 's advice and vote in favor of eu membership . the station and its euroskeptic sister newspaper , nasz dziennik , had earlier called on poles to " say ' no ' in order to save poland , for which the eu has reserved the role of a second-class member , " and damned the eu as being " not heaven , not hell , at most purgatory . " the station has broadcast a starkly different message in the final days leading up to the referendum .
" if the holy father says something , then we do not debate with the holy father , " the station 's director , father tadeusz rydzyk said in a broadcast . a raw deal for polish farmers ? but many polish farmers still believe they will get a raw deal if eu accession goes ahead .
farmers , who make up about 18 percent of the population , believe their businesses will be threatened if poland joins the eu , arguing that the accession terms for eu entry have been unfair . under the terms hammered out between warsaw and brussels at last december 's copenhagen summit , polish farmers are set to receive only 45 percent of the subsidies they would normally during their first year of eu membership .
although that figure will rise to 65 percent in 2006 , many are angry and have accused the miller administration of selling them down the river . 50 percent turnout required an additional problem facing the polish government is getting poles to the polls .
although the latest survey by the warsaw-based pollster obop found that 57 percent of voters were planning to cast their ballot this weekend , the figure was only slightly higher than the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum to pass . if polish voters fail to ratify the accession treaty , the polish parliament will have to do so itself through a two-thirds majority vote .
such a move could jeopardize miller 's government . however , both polish and foreign leaders have been out in force in recent weeks to assure poles that voting " yes " will not be tantamount to surrendering their sovereignty and that , in the end , the benefits of membership will in the long-term outweigh the immediate consequences . german aid for iraq mission ? during his visit on wednesday , schröder is also expected to discuss the polish-led security force in iraq with miller . nato countries agreed on monday to provide logistics , intelligence , communications , movement coordination and other troop support for the 7,500-strong force which is expected to be deployed in iraq 's south-central zone starting in september .
poland has already received pledges of troops from ukraine , bulgaria , denmark and norway . " we must find a way to enable us all to do our bit in building a new civil society in iraq , " german parliamentarian and member of the german-polish society , dietmar niethahn told deutsche welle . " and in that context i think it 's very important that poland gets support from nato .
and if nato gives poland help , germany as a nato member will be one of the countries to support them too .

in the first of five articles investigating lottery grants , bbc news online looks at the organisations which decide who are the winners and losers in the funding game .
for every £ 1 spent in the hope of winning a fortune , 28p finds its way to one of six good causes ; the generic name given to categorise recipients of lottery funding .
by february 2003 , £ 11,428,664,244 in lottery grants had been given to fund projects across the uk but , despite that enormous figure , recent research found lottery players knew little about who was spending the proceeds of their flutter .
a common misconception is that the government or camelot - the lottery game operators - distributes money to good causes .
in fact , 16 organisations - known as distributors - have been charged with handing out lottery funds , although one , the millennium commission , ceased to receive lottery income in 2001 .
controversial projects on the whole , these are free of government control .
they work within guidelines set by the department for culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- but decisions on which projects receive backing are made solely by the distributors .
this can get them into hot water .
it was the millennium commission which was responsible for issuing lottery funds to that most controversial of projects , the millennium dome in greenwich .
however , they are not alone in receiving the kind of high profile many would wish to avoid .
which bodies distribute money to projects like the royal opera house ?
a consistent problem faced by distributors is the publicity certain projects receive .
on the whole , the more high profile -lrb- and costly -rrb- the scheme , the greater the scope for negative publicity .
one such project was the refurbishment of the royal opera house , funded by the arts council of england to the tune of £ 73.5m.
" the royal opera house was one of the biggest and most controversial schemes , but that was the first lottery grant awarded by us " , said david mcneill from the arts council .
" but it would be wrong to say we supported an elitist institution in need .
it was a capital investment which allowed for the creation of two new performance spaces able to put on a wider , more inclusive , body of work . "
readers ' vent their anger ' added to the list of poorly received lottery projects would be sport england 's funding of the purchase of wembley stadium -lrb- £ 120m -rrb- and another controversial arts council award totalling almost £ 73m to sadler 's wells theatre .
but none of these quite compare to the reaction prompted by one grant from the community fund of £ 340,000 to the national coalition of anti-deportation campaigns -lrb- ncadc -rrb- .
a grant to asylum seekers was seen as wrong by some the daily mail newspaper ran a number of stories denouncing this grant and encouraged its readers to write to the community fund 's chairwoman , lady britain .
they printed the fund 's address for anyone who wanted to " vent their anger " at the award .
richard buxton , the fund 's chief executive told bbc news online : " we had a lot of problems at a number of levels as a result of the daily mail campaign .
" it was very unpleasant for our chairwoman who was directly targeted by the paper .
it was also unpleasant for our staff both from a physical and psychological point of view .
" we had staff in post room opening letters wearing gloves because people sent in things like excrement and used hypodermic needles .
" the source of the campaign was a grant to the ncadc for £ 340,000 , but there was a failure to report fairly the contribution in the context of our wider funding .
for example , we have given grants totalling £ 61m to citizens advice bureaux . "
how the funding is split between sport and the other five good causes the ncadc award prompted questions in parliament as some saw it as funding a political organisation .
the national audit office conducted an investigation which , while advising stricter checks on applicants , agreed the grant to ncadc was correct and followed lottery guidelines .
but the damage had been done .
public consultation conducted last year found : " at a national level there is awareness of the more controversial beneficiaries such as the dome , the royal opera house and most recently asylum seekers .
" the money spent by the lottery is considered by the public to be their money , and the lottery is described as being ' of the people for the people ' hence the public 's strong frustration and suspicion surrounding how the money is allocated and spent . "

in the first of five articles investigating lottery grants , bbc news online looks at the organisations which decide who are the winners and losers in the funding game .
for every £ 1 spent in the hope of winning a fortune , 28p finds its way to one of six good causes ; the generic name given to categorise recipients of lottery funding .
by february 2003 , £ 11,428,664,244 in lottery grants had been given to fund projects across the uk but , despite that enormous figure , recent research found lottery players knew little about who was spending the proceeds of their flutter .
a common misconception is that the government or camelot - the lottery game operators - distributes money to good causes .
in fact , 16 organisations - known as distributors - have been charged with handing out lottery funds , although one , the millennium commission , ceased to receive lottery income in 2001 .
controversial projects on the whole , these are free of government control .
they work within guidelines set by the department for culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- but decisions on which projects receive backing are made solely by the distributors .
this can get them into hot water .
it was the millennium commission which was responsible for issuing lottery funds to that most controversial of projects , the millennium dome in greenwich .
however , they are not alone in receiving the kind of high profile many would wish to avoid .
which bodies distribute money to projects like the royal opera house ?
a consistent problem faced by distributors is the publicity certain projects receive .
on the whole , the more high profile -lrb- and costly -rrb- the scheme , the greater the scope for negative publicity .
one such project was the refurbishment of the royal opera house , funded by the arts council of england to the tune of £ 73.5m.
" the royal opera house was one of the biggest and most controversial schemes , but that was the first lottery grant awarded by us " , said david mcneill from the arts council .
" but it would be wrong to say we supported an elitist institution in need .
it was a capital investment which allowed for the creation of two new performance spaces able to put on a wider , more inclusive , body of work . "
readers ' vent their anger ' added to the list of poorly received lottery projects would be sport england 's funding of the purchase of wembley stadium -lrb- £ 120m -rrb- and another controversial arts council award totalling almost £ 73m to sadler 's wells theatre .
but none of these quite compare to the reaction prompted by one grant from the community fund of £ 340,000 to the national coalition of anti-deportation campaigns -lrb- ncadc -rrb- .
a grant to asylum seekers was seen as wrong by some the daily mail newspaper ran a number of stories denouncing this grant and encouraged its readers to write to the community fund 's chairwoman , lady britain .
they printed the fund 's address for anyone who wanted to " vent their anger " at the award .
richard buxton , the fund 's chief executive told bbc news online : " we had a lot of problems at a number of levels as a result of the daily mail campaign .
" it was very unpleasant for our chairwoman who was directly targeted by the paper .
it was also unpleasant for our staff both from a physical and psychological point of view .
" we had staff in post room opening letters wearing gloves because people sent in things like excrement and used hypodermic needles .
" the source of the campaign was a grant to the ncadc for £ 340,000 , but there was a failure to report fairly the contribution in the context of our wider funding .
for example , we have given grants totalling £ 61m to citizens advice bureaux . "
how the funding is split between sport and the other five good causes the ncadc award prompted questions in parliament as some saw it as funding a political organisation .
the national audit office conducted an investigation which , while advising stricter checks on applicants , agreed the grant to ncadc was correct and followed lottery guidelines .
but the damage had been done .
public consultation conducted last year found : " at a national level there is awareness of the more controversial beneficiaries such as the dome , the royal opera house and most recently asylum seekers .
" the money spent by the lottery is considered by the public to be their money , and the lottery is described as being ' of the people for the people ' hence the public 's strong frustration and suspicion surrounding how the money is allocated and spent . "

in the first of five articles investigating lottery grants , bbc news online looks at the organisations which decide who are the winners and losers in the funding game .
for every £ 1 spent in the hope of winning a fortune , 28p finds its way to one of six good causes ; the generic name given to categorise recipients of lottery funding .
by february 2003 , £ 11,428,664,244 in lottery grants had been given to fund projects across the uk but , despite that enormous figure , recent research found lottery players knew little about who was spending the proceeds of their flutter .
a common misconception is that the government or camelot - the lottery game operators - distributes money to good causes .
in fact , 16 organisations - known as distributors - have been charged with handing out lottery funds , although one , the millennium commission , ceased to receive lottery income in 2001 .
controversial projects on the whole , these are free of government control .
they work within guidelines set by the department for culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- but decisions on which projects receive backing are made solely by the distributors .
this can get them into hot water .
it was the millennium commission which was responsible for issuing lottery funds to that most controversial of projects , the millennium dome in greenwich .
however , they are not alone in receiving the kind of high profile many would wish to avoid .
which bodies distribute money to projects like the royal opera house ?
a consistent problem faced by distributors is the publicity certain projects receive .
on the whole , the more high profile -lrb- and costly -rrb- the scheme , the greater the scope for negative publicity .
one such project was the refurbishment of the royal opera house , funded by the arts council of england to the tune of £ 73.5m.
" the royal opera house was one of the biggest and most controversial schemes , but that was the first lottery grant awarded by us " , said david mcneill from the arts council .
" but it would be wrong to say we supported an elitist institution in need .
it was a capital investment which allowed for the creation of two new performance spaces able to put on a wider , more inclusive , body of work . "
readers ' vent their anger ' added to the list of poorly received lottery projects would be sport england 's funding of the purchase of wembley stadium -lrb- £ 120m -rrb- and another controversial arts council award totalling almost £ 73m to sadler 's wells theatre .
but none of these quite compare to the reaction prompted by one grant from the community fund of £ 340,000 to the national coalition of anti-deportation campaigns -lrb- ncadc -rrb- .
a grant to asylum seekers was seen as wrong by some the daily mail newspaper ran a number of stories denouncing this grant and encouraged its readers to write to the community fund 's chairwoman , lady britain .
they printed the fund 's address for anyone who wanted to " vent their anger " at the award .
richard buxton , the fund 's chief executive told bbc news online : " we had a lot of problems at a number of levels as a result of the daily mail campaign .
" it was very unpleasant for our chairwoman who was directly targeted by the paper .
it was also unpleasant for our staff both from a physical and psychological point of view .
" we had staff in post room opening letters wearing gloves because people sent in things like excrement and used hypodermic needles .
" the source of the campaign was a grant to the ncadc for £ 340,000 , but there was a failure to report fairly the contribution in the context of our wider funding .
for example , we have given grants totalling £ 61m to citizens advice bureaux . "
how the funding is split between sport and the other five good causes the ncadc award prompted questions in parliament as some saw it as funding a political organisation .
the national audit office conducted an investigation which , while advising stricter checks on applicants , agreed the grant to ncadc was correct and followed lottery guidelines .
but the damage had been done .
public consultation conducted last year found : " at a national level there is awareness of the more controversial beneficiaries such as the dome , the royal opera house and most recently asylum seekers .
" the money spent by the lottery is considered by the public to be their money , and the lottery is described as being ' of the people for the people ' hence the public 's strong frustration and suspicion surrounding how the money is allocated and spent . "

richard buxton , the fund 's chief executive told bbc news online : " we had a lot of problems at a number of levels as a result of the daily mail campaign .

how the funding is split between sport and the other five good causes the ncadc award prompted questions in parliament as some saw it as funding a political organisation .

but none of these quite compare to the reaction prompted by one grant from the community fund of £ 340,000 to the national coalition of anti-deportation campaigns -lrb- ncadc -rrb- .
the daily mail newspaper ran a number of stories denouncing this grant and encouraged its readers to write to the community fund 's chairwoman , lady britain .
they printed the fund 's address for anyone who wanted to " vent their anger " at the award .
richard buxton , the fund 's chief executive told bbc news online : " we had a lot of problems at a number of levels as a result of the daily mail campaign .
" it was very unpleasant for our chairwoman who was directly targeted by the paper .
it was also unpleasant for our staff both from a physical and psychological point of view .
" we had staff in post room opening letters wearing gloves because people sent in things like excrement and used hypodermic needles .
" the source of the campaign was a grant to the ncadc for £ 340,000 , but there was a failure to report fairly the contribution in the context of our wider funding .
for example , we have given grants totalling £ 61m to citizens advice bureaux . "
the ncadc award prompted questions in parliament as some saw it as funding a political organisation .
the national audit office conducted an investigation which , while advising stricter checks on applicants , agreed the grant to ncadc was correct and followed lottery guidelines .
but the damage had been done .
public consultation conducted last year found : " at a national level there is awareness of the more controversial beneficiaries such as the dome , the royal opera house and most recently asylum seekers .
" the money spent by the lottery is considered by the public to be their money , and the lottery is described as being ' of the people for the people ' hence the public 's strong frustration and suspicion surrounding how the money is allocated and spent . "
next : big projects v community schemes .
what has lottery money been spent on ?

the mine 's owners , baseresult holdings , said pumping at the mine - which closed in 1998 - was expected to start within a year .
a government regeneration authority has warned baseresult that if it does not start tin production , or put forward an alternative development plan , it will buy the site in a compulsory purchase .
kevin williams , managing director of baseresult and mine manager at south crofty , said he was confident the firm would satisfy the requirements .
it 's all tried and tested kevin williams , baseresult once in full production , mr williams said the mine would employ about 200 people .
mr williams , who worked at geevor tin mine in cornwall for 15 years , said : " we have devised a method to operate the mine so that cash operating costs are lower than the lowest tin price since the 1985 crash , somewhere around $ 3,600 -lrb- a tonne -rrb- . "
" we know how to do it .
" it 's just a matter of putting the process into effect given the nuances of this mine .
it 's all tried and tested . "
when asked who was financing the project , mr williams said : " i am not in a position to name the backer . "
" -lrb- i am -rrb- open to approaches from other backers , but finances are currently satisfactory . "
costs warning when the mine closed it was producing a relatively small 2,100 tonnes of tin in concentrate per year .
mark kaczmarek , a local councillor who was a miner at south crofty for 17 years , said he was pessimistic about the reopening .
he said : " when it was working , we were pumping one million gallons a day to keep dry .
" if you pump two million gallons per day it will take three years to dewater the mine .
when it was operating , pumping costs were over £ 1m per year . "
the camborne , pool and redruth regeneration company , said the compulsory purchase order would take about two years to get to the inquiry stage .
if by then baseresult had any realistic prospects of doing anything at the mine , the order could be held in abeyance for a period of up to a maximum of three years .
suggestions for future uses included a leisure centre , an indoor surfing centre , a white water canoe course , as well as homes , offices and a heritage attraction .

it 's all tried and tested kevin williams , baseresult once in full production , mr williams said the mine would employ about 200 people .
mr williams , who worked at geevor tin mine in cornwall for 15 years , said : " we have devised a method to operate the mine so that cash operating costs are lower than the lowest tin price since the 1985 crash , somewhere around $ 3,600 -lrb- a tonne -rrb- . "
" we know how to do it .
" it 's just a matter of putting the process into effect given the nuances of this mine .
it 's all tried and tested . "
when asked who was financing the project , mr williams said : " i am not in a position to name the backer . "
" -lrb- i am -rrb- open to approaches from other backers , but finances are currently satisfactory . "
costs warning when the mine closed it was producing a relatively small 2,100 tonnes of tin in concentrate per year .
mark kaczmarek , a local councillor who was a miner at south crofty for 17 years , said he was pessimistic about the reopening .
he said : " when it was working , we were pumping one million gallons a day to keep dry .
" if you pump two million gallons per day it will take three years to dewater the mine .
when it was operating , pumping costs were over £ 1m per year . "
the camborne , pool and redruth regeneration company , said the compulsory purchase order would take about two years to get to the inquiry stage .
if by then baseresult had any realistic prospects of doing anything at the mine , the order could be held in abeyance for a period of up to a maximum of three years .
suggestions for future uses included a leisure centre , an indoor surfing centre , a white water canoe course , as well as homes , offices and a heritage attraction .
