cardinal sin wields considerable influence in the philippines , where about 80 % of the population is roman catholic .
he played a crucial role in a popular revolt that deposed the country 's dictator , ferdinand marcos , in 1986 .
cardinal sin was also one of the most outspoken critics of joseph estrada , who was forced to quit the presidency in 2001 over corruption allegations .
the archbishop suffered a bout of seizures after celebrating mass at a chapel in his residence , his spokesman bishop socrates villegas said .

two inner city areas in london have been running " restorative justice " pilots and have found that , in up to 70 % of cases , there was no need for the perpetrators to be suspended or expelled .
the victims , meanwhile , had their faith in the justice system boosted , said lord warner , chairman of the youth justice board .
he said the youth offending teams in the london boroughs of lambeth and hammersmith and fulham had held 132 restorative justice " conferences " - meetings between victims and perpetrators .
the offender might be accompanied by a parent or friend and was put in a room with the victim , who could be another pupil or a teacher , along with a trained mediator , he said .
the perpetrator was usually asked what he was going to do to put things right .
apology offered " invariably what comes out is some kind of apology , some kind of reparation , it depends on the circumstances , " lord warner said .
in 90 cases , they enabled a child in danger of being ejected from school to stay on , lord warner told the secondary heads association 's annual conference in birmingham .
restorative justice has been used in the united states for some years , and was pioneered in england by thames valley police .
lord warner also urged the government to spend more money on parenting courses for mothers and fathers of teenage criminals .
out of 3,000 people who went on the courses , which involved a two or three-hour session a week for two months or so , and cost the taxpayer about £ 500 , a third found their children stopped offending .
there was an overall 50 % reduction in the number of crimes these children committed .
