james miller , 34 , from devon , was shot in the southern troublespot of rafah .
initial findings from an israeli defence forces investigation into the affair indicate that the correspondent was shot in the back , with sources suggesting that he may have been hit by palestinian gunfire .
the award-winning journalist was filming a documentary on the effect of terrorism on children for the american cable giant hbo .
another briton who had been with mr miller said they were waving a white flag and moving towards an israeli armoured vehicle when it opened fire .
aidan white , general secretary of the international federation of journalists , said the israeli army must not be allowed to " brush aside " mr miller 's death with their " routine and callous expressions of regret " .
the israeli army said it had returned fire after being attacked by rocket-propelled grenades and expressed " sorrow at a civilian death " .
but a spokesman added : " it must be stressed a cameraman who knowingly enters a combat zone , especially at night , endangers himself . "
palestinian journalists have showed their support mr white , whose federation operates on behalf of about 500,000 journalists globally , said there must be a full inquiry into mr miller 's death , a call echoed by the foreign office .
" killing journalists either deliberately or by gross negligence should be made official war crimes under international law , " he said .
" there is now an unstoppable wave of anger within journalism which is calling for action to halt this process .
" the military authorities can not any longer ignore the fact that journalists in war zones and conflict areas are doing a legitimate and important public duty and that special attention must be paid to their safety . "
mr white said it was a " terrible irony " that mr miller died on world press freedom day .
a foreign office spokesman said : " we are in contact with the israeli authorities and pushing for a full and transparent investigation . "
mr miller was born in haverfordwest , pembrokeshire , and had been living in devon with his wife and son .
the cameraman had won international acclaim for his documentary work including beneath the veil - a film about life under the taleban .
the cameraman was working for us tv he was killed in rafah , an area of gaza on the southern border with egypt which is a site of frequent gun battles between israeli soldiers and palestinian militants .
on friday , the israeli foreign ministry announced plans to crack down on international " human shield " volunteers who have attempted to prevent demolitions .
they started by detaining a member of the international solidarity movement -lrb- ism -rrb- in rafah .
a british peace activist with the ism is now in a coma after he was shot in the head by an israeli tank in rafah last month .
thomas hurndall , 22 , was believed to have been among a group of nine activists who had to abandon their planned protest at a refugee camp in rafah when shooting started .

james miller , 34 , from devon , was shot in the southern troublespot of rafah .
initial findings from an israeli defence forces investigation into the affair indicate that the correspondent was shot in the back , with sources suggesting that he may have been hit by palestinian gunfire .
the award-winning journalist was filming a documentary on the effect of terrorism on children for the american cable giant hbo .
another briton who had been with mr miller said they were waving a white flag and moving towards an israeli armoured vehicle when it opened fire .
aidan white , general secretary of the international federation of journalists , said the israeli army must not be allowed to " brush aside " mr miller 's death with their " routine and callous expressions of regret " .
the israeli army said it had returned fire after being attacked by rocket-propelled grenades and expressed " sorrow at a civilian death " .
but a spokesman added : " it must be stressed a cameraman who knowingly enters a combat zone , especially at night , endangers himself . "
palestinian journalists have showed their support mr white , whose federation operates on behalf of about 500,000 journalists globally , said there must be a full inquiry into mr miller 's death , a call echoed by the foreign office .
" killing journalists either deliberately or by gross negligence should be made official war crimes under international law , " he said .
" there is now an unstoppable wave of anger within journalism which is calling for action to halt this process .
" the military authorities can not any longer ignore the fact that journalists in war zones and conflict areas are doing a legitimate and important public duty and that special attention must be paid to their safety . "
mr white said it was a " terrible irony " that mr miller died on world press freedom day .
a foreign office spokesman said : " we are in contact with the israeli authorities and pushing for a full and transparent investigation . "
mr miller was born in haverfordwest , pembrokeshire , and had been living in devon with his wife and son .
the cameraman had won international acclaim for his documentary work including beneath the veil - a film about life under the taleban .
the cameraman was working for us tv he was killed in rafah , an area of gaza on the southern border with egypt which is a site of frequent gun battles between israeli soldiers and palestinian militants .

they started by detaining a member of the international solidarity movement -lrb- ism -rrb- in rafah .
a british peace activist with the ism is now in a coma after he was shot in the head by an israeli tank in rafah last month .
thomas hurndall , 22 , was believed to have been among a group of nine activists who had to abandon their planned protest at a refugee camp in rafah when shooting started .
two other peace activists were also wounded last month and a 23-year-old american was killed in march .

net historians have trawled records and found that the first junk e-mail message hawking a company or its wares was sent back in 1978 .
coincidentally , the first commercial spam sent to usenet discussion groups was sent a little over 10 years ago .
now spam is thought to account for up to 40 % of all e-mail messages sent across the net and many industry groups , companies and technologists are uniting to fight the flood .
hawking history research by net alumni brad templeton has found that the first spam message was sent back in the days when the internet was known as arpanet .
by 1978 arpanet had been operating for about nine years and was letting lots of people at universities and government bodies swap e-mail .
on 3 may a marketing executive at digital equipment corporation , a leading maker of minicomputers , decided to send all west coast arpanet users a message about an open day that would show off its new range of machines .
the message generated huge controversy within the arpanet community , partly because it was so poorly written and because it clearly broke the nascent network 's acceptable use policy .
as a research aid , e-mail messages on arpanet were supposed to be non-commercial .
this messages pre-dated the use of the term " spam " which has subsequently become applied to junk mail thanks to a monty python sketch in which customers of a restaurant are offered spam with everything .
mr templeton has also found the first use of the term " spam " to describe a junk e-mail message .
on 31 march 1993 usenet administrator richard depew inadvertently posted the same message 200 times to a discussion group .
adopting a term previously used in online text games , outraged usenet users branded the excessive message posting " spam " .
another milestone in the history of spam took place in april 1994 when arizona law firm canter and siegel posted a message about green card lottery services to hundreds of usenet discussion groups .
from there spam has grown and grown and now , according to figures from spam stopper brightmail , accounts for 40 % of all e-mail traffic .
in 2001 , spam was only 8 % of all e-mail traffic .
not only does spam annoy people , most of the offers made in the messages are bogus .
a study for the us federal trade commission found that almost 66 % of the 1,000 junk mail messages scrutinised were false in some way .
the report lends credence to speculation that spammers send the messages only to entice people to respond so they can draw up a huge list of live e-mail addresses that they can then sell on to others .
