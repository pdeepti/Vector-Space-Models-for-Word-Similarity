following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "
every party thus needed to consider systematic changes .
he supported the concept of citizen 's insurance , although it would not be easy to push through in the opposition cdu / csu , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers .

german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table . should european nations re-open a can of worms ?
that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .

what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "
every party thus needed to consider systematic changes .

german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table . should european nations re-open a can of worms ?
that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "
every party thus needed to consider systematic changes .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "
every party thus needed to consider systematic changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit world -pipe- 24.07.2003 fischer says hands off eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations should n't try to change the draft constitution , says german foreign minister joschka fischer .
german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table . should european nations re-open a can of worms ?
that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .
however , others , like anna lührmann , from the minister 's own green party , feel a referendum will help the constitution gain maximum legitimacy . these issues , will be on the agenda at the intergovernmental conference scheduled to start in october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's full coverage of the eu constitution , the debate that has accompanied it and what it will mean for the future of europe .

what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .
however , others , like anna lührmann , from the minister 's own green party , feel a referendum will help the constitution gain maximum legitimacy . these issues , will be on the agenda at the intergovernmental conference scheduled to start in october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's full coverage of the eu constitution , the debate that has accompanied it and what it will mean for the future of europe .

german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table . should european nations re-open a can of worms ?
that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "
every party thus needed to consider systematic changes .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .

german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table . should european nations re-open a can of worms ?
that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .

that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "
every party thus needed to consider systematic changes .
he supported the concept of citizen 's insurance , although it would not be easy to push through in the opposition cdu / csu , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers .

german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table . should european nations re-open a can of worms ?
that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .
however , others , like anna lührmann , from the minister 's own green party , feel a referendum will help the constitution gain maximum legitimacy . these issues , will be on the agenda at the intergovernmental conference scheduled to start in october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's full coverage of the eu constitution , the debate that has accompanied it and what it will mean for the future of europe .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "

german foreign minister joschka fischer warns other european countries not to re-negotiate the eu draft constitution .
should they attempt to do so , germany would follow suit , bringing their own grievances to the table . should european nations re-open a can of worms ?
that was the metaphorical question on the table in berlin wednesday night during a special meeting of the european committee of the lower house of parliament , bundestag . members of the committee debated whether or not aspects of the carefully negotiated draft constitution - which contains many delicate compromises - should be re-negotiated during the intergovernmental conference set to start in october . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose government has advocated the full acceptance of the constitution by all european nations as is , warned that should the package be taken apart , " it will be very difficult to bring it back together " .
what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .
however , others , like anna lührmann , from the minister 's own green party , feel a referendum will help the constitution gain maximum legitimacy . these issues , will be on the agenda at the intergovernmental conference scheduled to start in october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's full coverage of the eu constitution , the debate that has accompanied it and what it will mean for the future of europe .

following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .

what 's more , said fischer , " those who open it , must have the strength to tie it back together " . taking apart a delicate compromise indeed , that would be a difficult task , as the current draft constitution resulted from years of negotiation in the convention for the future of europe , headed by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing . should the compromises reached at the convention fall apart , it could result in serious delays for the process of european reform , which fischer and other european countries are hoping to avoid . on the surface , at least , fischer has the backing of many german politicians from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
the german representatives to the convention , jürgen meyer from the ruling social democrats and peter altmaier , a member of the opposition cdu , concurred . " everyone who tries to open the package must show that he has a better compromise in mind , and that he can bring the issue to a close , " said meyer . lingering concerns from smaller nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer and others in the committee were likely responding to a debate that has emerged in recent days , following comments made by the foreign ministers of a few smaller eu countries at a televised public debate on monday . it 's no secret that smaller eu countries have been on the offensive , concerned that several changes codified in the new agreement could be to their disadvantage .
they are specifically concerned about the introduction of qualified majority voting .
as of 2009 , countries representing 60 percent of europe 's population will represent the majority , which means that smaller countries will have a hard time opposing legislation backed by the " big three " , germany , france and italy .
until now , smaller countries have benefited from voting weights , which gave them more influence in european affairs . smaller nations , including austria and finland , had hoped to redress this issue during the intergovernmental conference in october .
they , therefore , have reacted strongly to recent italian attempts to start the conference early and wrap things up by the end of the year .
from their point of view , that simply does not leave enough time . at the debate on monday , finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja said that it was not right to start the negotiations so early : " we must have ample time to refer to all these issues . "
austrian foreign minister benita-waldner concurred , stating that many sensitive questions had been left open , including the position of smaller countries . the news that smaller nations were hoping to tackle issues as delicate as voting rules was a sign of the difficult road to approval for the newly drafted constitution . rehashing issues : germany 's latent concerns but smaller nations are not the only ones with a laundry list of concerns .
germany has its own , which they have - according to fischer - thus far put on the back-burner in the interest of compromise .
but should other countries take the lead and re-open the negotiation process , germany will follow suit .
" should the draft be opened up again , we will not hold back , " he warned . germany has expressed concern about turning over key competencies to the eu .
among them : allowing the european parliament instead of member states to have final say over the budget .
as the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , this could cost the german government more than a € 1 billion a year . members of the opposition cdu have also criticized the immigration rules as inadequate and members of both parties are hoping to press for qualified majority voting in foreign affairs issues relating to the common foreign and security policy . altmaier challenged fischer to reach an agreement with the committee on which issues should be taken up again should the negotiations go into a second round . a referendum ? at the same meeting , fischer also expressed his opinion over whether or not the eu constitution should be submitted for a referendum .
contrary to most members of the minister 's green party , fischer was sceptical of such an action .
" unlike the majority of my party , i belong to the sceptics on this issue , " he said . some fear that voters could use the referendum as a vent for their general discontent with the current german government , which could unnecessarily endanger the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.07.2003 calling all citizens to pay up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for foreign minister joschka fischer , the way up for germany 's economy requires a better social system .
following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " . german foreign minister joschka fischer has called for a general change in the country 's social welfare structure .
" linking our social system to gross wages is not a lasting solution , " he told the german daily financial times deutschland on thursday .
social costs , such as health and unemployment insurance , are split equally between employers and employees .
employers in particular have strongly criticized the high non-wage labor costs existing in germany .
in order to make wages more competitive , social welfare needed to be secured on a wider basis , fischer said .
the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " could be the solution for the future .
according to fischer , not just employees , but all citizens would have to contribute to the social insurance system .
currently , civil servants and self-employed persons are not required by law to do so .
in return , the percentage rates of social contributions could be significantly cut .
this would thus reduce non-wage labor costs .
sending the right signals " we have to become more competitive , " fischer said .
" we can not accept the high levels of unemployment .
in order to reduce them , we need more investment , also from abroad . "
but a major problem was that the german social systems sent false signals to the employment market , he added .
the landmark deal reached earlier this week to cut back germany 's costly health system marked the beginning of reforms .
fischer said he expected citizen 's insurance to eventually be introduced in germany .
the coalition government of social democrats and greens agreed on this point , he said .
the minister said he was glad that the current debate was not only focussing on changes and more efficiency in the social structure , but also on an overall change to the system .
support from the other side fischer is not just getting support from his own ranks .
opposition party member horst seehofer from the csu is also in favor of citizen 's insurance .
health expert seehofer , who was the opposition 's chief negotiator in the healthcare reform , said there still needed to be an answer to the problem of an aging society .
" i am convinced that we have reached the limits of possible reforms of the existing health insurance system , " he told german television zdf .
" there can not be more reforms within this system , without questioning the system itself or placing unacceptable demands on people . "
every party thus needed to consider systematic changes .
he supported the concept of citizen 's insurance , although it would not be easy to push through in the opposition cdu / csu , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers .

the 174 panels produce 30 kilowatts of power , which is enough to light and heat the church 's two halls with an expected surplus being sold off .
the deal with the national grid using the solar panels is thought to be the first of its kind involving a church building .
the panels also provide sound proofing for the church which is under the heathrow flight path .
the reverend marion warman , 82 , an honorary curate at st mary 's , said the department of trade and industry provided 90 % of the £ 169,000 cost of installing the panels .
' small sums ' she said : " the panels will cut our electricity bills considerably , but we do n't yet know how much money we may receive for the electricity we sell to the national grid .
" the sums will probably be quite small . "
energy minister stephen timms said : " this project is an excellent example of how solar power can give a new lease of life to a community building , providing power and sound proofing .
" it is also playing its part in reducing greenhouse gases and meeting the government 's aim to cut carbon dioxide by 60 % by 2050 . "

the church of st mary 's in osterley , west london , has a surplus of electricity after installing solar panels in the roof of a new hall .
the 174 panels produce 30 kilowatts of power , which is enough to light and heat the church 's two halls with an expected surplus being sold off .
the deal with the national grid using the solar panels is thought to be the first of its kind involving a church building .
the panels also provide sound proofing for the church which is under the heathrow flight path .
the reverend marion warman , 82 , an honorary curate at st mary 's , said the department of trade and industry provided 90 % of the £ 169,000 cost of installing the panels .
' small sums ' she said : " the panels will cut our electricity bills considerably , but we do n't yet know how much money we may receive for the electricity we sell to the national grid .
" the sums will probably be quite small . "
energy minister stephen timms said : " this project is an excellent example of how solar power can give a new lease of life to a community building , providing power and sound proofing .
" it is also playing its part in reducing greenhouse gases and meeting the government 's aim to cut carbon dioxide by 60 % by 2050 . "

the us international trade commission 's -lrb- usitc -rrb- decision to slap higher duties on vietnamese catfish and computer memory chips made by south korean firm hynix will take effect in mid-august .
hynix semiconductor has already vowed to fight back through the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- or court of international trade .
hynix , the world 's third biggest memory chip maker , said it was " very disappointed " by the decision .
fish and chips it means that hynix 's dram -lrb- dynamic random access memory -rrb- chips will face extra tariffs of 44.7 % , while importers of vietnamese catfish must pay a further 64 % .
vietnamese-farmed fish has captured a fifth of the us market for catfish fillets .
us catfish producers had complained that vietnamese farmed catfish fillets were being dumped on the us market at unfair prices .
the dispute is the most serious between the us and vietnam since the two former enemies normalised trade relations two years ago .
rejected suitor the ustic upheld its earlier finding that the south korean government had unfairly subsidised hynix 's dram - or dynamic random access memory - chips .

but rival us chipmaker micron technology , whose takeover offer hynix rejected in april 2002 , has welcomed the decision .
hynix was teetering on the verge of collapse when it turned down micro 's takeover but was later bailed out by an alliance of south korean banks .
micron said the tariffs on hynix chips supported its view that " hynix received billions of dollars in illegal subsidies " .
the ustic decision " reaffirms that free trade must also be fair trade and demonstrates our government 's decision to reinforce trade laws , " said micron chief executive steve appleton .
south korea said at the time of the usitc 's original report that it would take the us to the wto global trade umpire if extra tariffs were imposed .

but for foreigners desperate to claim asylum in the uk , this unassuming office , now the base for the cardiff law centre , could make the difference between a new start or being sent back to a country where their lives are at risk .
hearing tales of suffering is all in a day 's work for the immigration team working at the centre .
sarah sugden , the supervisor for immigration , said it was vital to try to keep her emotions under control in order to be able to help people properly .
the client lives off nothing virtually , lives in squalor , ca n't work sarah sugden clients arrive for help from a number of channels - they could be referred through an agency such as the welsh refugee council , or sometimes directly from the police .
in some cases , people will call unannounced at the office looking for assistance .
" we bring the client in , take instructions and find out the basis of the claim , " explained ms sugden .
" we then contact immigration services if they have n't been contacted already .
" they arrange a screening interview , because they wo n't take written claims anymore - we used to be able to send claims through the post .
asylum seekers in wales wales total : 2,200 1,200 in cardiff 700 in swansea 200 in newport 51 in wrexham -lrb- before caia park riots -rrb- " now they have to screen the client and conduct a bio-data interview , which basically verifies who they are .
" they take fingerprints and photographs and put them on the police national computer , so they can be checked wherever they are .
" they then give us a statement of evidence form -lrb- sef -rrb- , a self-completion questionnaire , which is a detailed analysis of their claim .
" we fill in the questionnaire with them , and then sit and wait for an interview in either croydon or liverpool where they go through the whole sef with them and basically try to catch them out .
supervisor sarah sugden and case worker yasin ekmen struggle of torture victim centre 's aid for lives in limbo riot estate searches for answers river escape from persecution refugee feared for his life toddlers among asylum-seekers " then you wait for the home office to make a decision and we act relevantly on that . "
the claimant 's life remains on hold while the decision is being made , according to ms sugden .
" the client lives off nothing virtually , lives in squalor , ca n't work .
" if they had been in the country for six months and there had n't been a decision , they used to have an entitlement to work .
the new immigration and asylum act has revoked that entitlement , so there 's no more working .
" so they literally sit down with their £ 37.50 or whatever it is per week and do nothing . "
the home office 's decision will either mean celebrations for the claimant and the team , or an appeal against deportation .
' unbreakable ' the money to pay for the immigration team comes from the legal services commission , which is publicly funded .
most asylum seekers are able to qualify for free legal help .
ms sugden explained : " they normally sell up everything to pay their fare to come to britain .
" it 's very rare that they come over with sufficient funds for themselves - if they did , they 'd have to pay privately for practice .
" if not , they come to people like us for legal help . "
ms sugden is concerned that their service could be under threat .
asylum seekers , when they get granted asylum , fill up the jobs that british people quite simply wo n't do sarah sugden " it was a scary moment when france managed to get rid of sangatte -lrb- the asylum camp near calais -rrb- .
" there was the security that the -lsb- geneva -rsb- convention -lsb- on refugees -rsb- was unbreakable , but now france is trying to get out of asylum by the look of it , " she said .
" if france succeeds in getting rid of asylum in their country , then any signatory country could do so .
" i know the government wants to get rid of asylum but i do n't think they could , because the revenue from asylum in this country is colossal .
" asylum seekers , when they get granted asylum , fill up the jobs that british people quite simply wo n't do .
" if they get rid of asylum , everyone 's going to feel it . "

red kites have only recently been reintroduced to parts of the uk owls , red kites , peregrine falcons are being targeted while their eggs and chicks are being routinely stolen from nests , according to new figures .
cumbria and devon recorded the highest numbers of crimes against birds of prey .
other hotspots include northumberland , north yorkshire , west yorkshire , south wales and parts of scotland .
the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- , which released the findings on thursday , warned the rate of destruction showed no signs of abating .
these crimes belong more to the victorian era than today 's supposedly more enlightened times graham elliott , rspb the charity said the figures meant the law protecting birds of prey must not be weakened .
graham elliott , head of the rspb 's investigation section , said : " birds of prey , such as the red kite and peregrine falcon , are among the best loved birds in britain , but the persecution of these protected species ranks as some of the most serious of wildlife crimes .
" these crimes belong more to the victorian era than today 's supposedly more enlightened times . "
the rspb 's birdcrime 2002 report shows that more than half of the 591 incidents involving wild birds reported across the uk were crimes against birds of prey or owls .
of these , 141 involved shooting and destruction of birds of prey , 42 of which were confirmed by the recovery of a body or illegally-set trap .
egg collectors there were 102 reported incidents involving the use of poison , which resulted in the deaths of 32 birds of prey .
the spectacular red kite continues to fall foul of illegal poisoned bait laid in the countryside while peregrine nests continue to be plundered for their eggs and young .
mr elliott added : " we were alarmed by the number of reports last year of birds of prey persecution and this year is shaping up to be just as bad .
" it is especially worrying that , against a trend of declining nest robberies following the imprisonment of several egg collectors , peregrine nest robberies continue at such a high level . "
a total of 33 offenders were prosecuted last year for crimes against wild birds , and six of those received custodial sentences .

" these crimes belong more to the victorian era than today 's supposedly more enlightened times . "
the rspb 's birdcrime 2002 report shows that more than half of the 591 incidents involving wild birds reported across the uk were crimes against birds of prey or owls .
of these , 141 involved shooting and destruction of birds of prey , 42 of which were confirmed by the recovery of a body or illegally-set trap .
egg collectors there were 102 reported incidents involving the use of poison , which resulted in the deaths of 32 birds of prey .
the spectacular red kite continues to fall foul of illegal poisoned bait laid in the countryside while peregrine nests continue to be plundered for their eggs and young .
mr elliott added : " we were alarmed by the number of reports last year of birds of prey persecution and this year is shaping up to be just as bad .
" it is especially worrying that , against a trend of declining nest robberies following the imprisonment of several egg collectors , peregrine nest robberies continue at such a high level . "
a total of 33 offenders were prosecuted last year for crimes against wild birds , and six of those received custodial sentences .

for the cardiff law centre asylum team , tales like those of anna -lrb- not her real name -rrb- are sadly not unique .
until recently , anna was living a normal , family life in her native country , with her husband and young daughter .
her husband was quite a senior figure involved with the government in zimbabwe , which meant the family was fairly well-off .
but then anna was accused of being involved with the opposition movement for democratic change and her life took an horrific turn .
sarah sugden , immigration supervisor for the law centre , recounted how anna came to be a client .
there were obvious signs she had been tortured and the secretary of state decided , no , we are not going to grant asylum in this case sarah sugden " there 's a group called the green bombers , or zanu-pf -lsb- the ruling party -rsb- , and they go around terrorising mdc members because they do n't want the opposition around , " she said .
" she was accused of involvement and , although she was n't , her husband left her because he could n't be associated with such things .
" he ran off and left her all alone with the child .
" she was attacked numerous times , kidnapped , gang-raped by zanu-pf members , went through the most horrific tortures you can imagine .
asylum seekers in wales wales total : 2,200 1,200 in cardiff 700 in swansea 200 in newport 51 in wrexham -lrb- before caia park riots -rrb- " they took her to abattoirs and submerged her in vats of ice and meat .
" they 'd beat her , they stripped her naked and walked her though the town naked , and young boys would be touching her .
" in the end , she had no choice but to flee the country because she knew the next time , that was going to be it . "
psychiatric reports anna fled to england and then came to wales .
she could not afford to bring her daughter and was forced to leave the child with her sister .
" she went through the usual asylum process and got refused , which seemed quite outrageous , " said ms sugden .
" we had medical reports and psychiatric reports stating it was quite obvious she was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder .
supervisor sarah sugden and case worker yasin ekmen struggle of torture victim centre 's aid for lives in limbo riot estate searches for answers river escape from persecution refugee feared for his life toddlers among asylum-seekers " there were obvious signs she had been tortured and the secretary of state decided , no , we are not going to grant asylum in this case . "
the centre appealed against the decision , but the nature of the case made it quite complicated .
" when she first came here , she did n't want to admit she has been raped , because in africa , it 's a sign of social degradation , " ms sugden explained .
" if you 've been raped and you are a woman , you have to go through a tribal cleansing ceremony , which is quite horrible .
" women will want to avoid this so they wo n't admit they have been raped .
" our client was very lucky as she did n't contract aids or hiv , which is quite common from the rapes in zimbabwe . "
because anna had not mentioned rape in her asylum claim initially , when she finally brought it up , the assessors said it was not credible that she would have kept quiet about it .
" we put forward a very good argument that that is not actually the case , " ms sugden said .
on the edge anna 's appeal was adjourned no fewer than six times before it was finally heard .
" by that time she had been worn down to virtually nothing .
she was in a terrible state .
she was very much on the edge .
" i 'd had letters from her saying she could n't live anymore , that she was going to take her own life .
" the guilt she feels for leaving her daughter behind is quite horrendous on top of everything else that 's happened to her . "
anna 's appeal was successful - ms sugden described it as a " fortunate case " .
" a lot of clients , they do n't get a good outcome - it 's quite tragic , " she said .
but anna 's struggle is not over yet .
she has found out that her husband is now going through the courts in zimbabwe to get custody of their daughter from her sister and , because of his connections , is likely to win .
the centre is now trying through the red cross to bring the girl to wales to be with her mother .

the northern ireland race equality strategy will be discussed at the forum in londonderry on thursday .
the strategy was announced earlier this year as part of government measures to tackle the root causes of racial inequalities within society in northern ireland .
nio minister john spellar said it was important for the public to be involved in determining the best ways to improve race relations .
he said " good progress " had already been made through public consultation and for members of minority ethnic communities , but these seminars would provide a further opportunity for people to put forward their views .
strategy 's aims eliminate racial discrimination and promote equality of opportunity for people of ethnic backgrounds increase equality of opportunity for minority ethnic people combat racism and provide protection against racist crime promote good relations and mutual respect between people of different ethnic backgrounds , including irish travellers increase awareness and understanding of and respect for minority ethnic groups increase participation of ethnic people in social , public , economic and cultural life help minority ethnic communities to contribute to achieving the strategy 's aims a spate of racist attacks have been reported in northern ireland in recent weeks .
earlier this month , the home of a mixed race muslim family in craigavon , county armagh , was attacked by a gang of up to 10 men who used baseball bats and iron bars to break windows and doors .
the family , who had been targeted before , decided to move away from the province , saying " northern ireland is just not ready for different people " .
police suspected pipe bomb attacks on two homes in the donegall avenue area of south belfast last month were racially motivated .
mr spellar said the recent attacks were " very disturbing " .
" we all must work together to eradicate this cancer before it poisons our society , " he said .
" by listening to views from as many people as possible , we can build a race equality strategy - owned by the whole community , for the whole community .
" we want to ensure that this consultation is as broadly-based and inclusive as possible , and i would urge everyone to attend the forthcoming seminars which provide an ideal opportunity to help influence government policy on race equality . "
police said 226 racial incidents were reported between april 2002 and april 2003 , with 185 such attacks in the previous year .
the first seminar will be held in calgach centre at butcher street in derry , while further meetings are to take place in dungannon on 28 july and in belfast the following day .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- reporting asylum : ask the experts bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 24 july , 2003 , 07:12 gmt 08:12 uk reporting asylum : ask the experts journalist john torode and mike jempson , director of the media ethics charity , presswise , answered your questions .
the words ' asylum seeker ' have become an emotive phrase , arousing suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .

launch interactive version click here to read the transcript the words ' asylum seeker ' have become an emotive phrase , arousing suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .

so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .

freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?

what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .

it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .

negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .

mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .

launch interactive version click here to read the transcript the words ' asylum seeker ' have become an emotive phrase , arousing suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .

that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .

there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .

negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .

phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .

nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .

launch interactive version click here to read the transcript the words ' asylum seeker ' have become an emotive phrase , arousing suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?

now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .

but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .

nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .

launch interactive version click here to read the transcript the words ' asylum seeker ' have become an emotive phrase , arousing suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .

john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .

negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .

i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .
racism is being veiled behind the use of a term like asylum seekers and that makes it very difficult for people to have sensible conversations or rational arguments or whatever .
because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .
nobody can distinguish out on the streets or in their normal lives , who fits which bill .
and when general terms are used to cover everybody and the technical terms are misapplied , it does n't help people to get involved in the debate and indeed to challenge their mps properly about the political issues .
nick higham : john , two points there i suppose .
one is that you are stereotyping the entire group of people without making it clear that obviously they 're all individuals and they 're all different .
john torode : what is this group ?
nick higham : this group is asylum seekers who are being lumped together .
john torode : i do n't think anybody lumps together asylum seekers .
i think the debate is about the difference between bogus asylum seekers and genuine asylum seekers .
nick higham : do you think the public has become confused - some people have become confused in their minds as to whether there is such a thing as a non-bogus asylum seeker ?
john torode : i think they probably have and i think that 's partly because the government and the whole liberal chattering classes have refused to accept that there is any sort of problem .
and the public knows there 's a problem .
perhaps chaps who live in hampstead or islington or wherever it is that mike lives , places where i live , do n't know there 's a problem .
mike jempson : i live in bristol in fact john - there 's no need to be offensive .
john torode : if you live on the sort of council estates where a lot of the chaps who 've disappeared into the woodwork end up .
if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .
john torode : i have as far as i am concerned one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers - and i 'll offer mike another hostage to fortune - one of the most worrying groups of asylum seekers we have at the moment are the albanians and kosovans , who do seem disproportionately to carry organised crime with them .
my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .
the fact that the asylum system is not working efficiently .
the fact that the authorities are not able to deal with people traffickers .
the fact that there seem to be some very peculiar ways in which the immigration service are working .
the fact that we do n't have very intelligent immigration policies , for instance .
all of those are the important issues .
all i 'm saying is that when - and it 's not correct for john to say these terms do n't get misused - you will in story after story , terms like asylum seeker , bogus asylum seeker , illegals , illegal immigrants , refugees , are used coterminously .
it 's very difficult for the reading public to say what is these distinctions when there are quite clinical distinctions between them .
they all get lumped together .
it 's the individuals who then get focused on instead of addressing the political issues that john has also pointed out are most important .
nick higham : one last e-mail on this which has just come in from ian in cardiff - john if you could just answer this : why do we not hear the same level of hysteria from the anti asylum lobby about the large numbers of white australian , new zealand , canadian , irish and american illegal residents of this country ?
john torode : i should imagine because they are as a statement of fact , not as a statement of prejudice , they are more easily assimilable because they are of north european stock , to put it very crudely .
this is a statement of fact , just as africans turning up in one part of africa would be more easily assimilable perhaps than i would be because i 'm white .
this is not a question of racial prejudice , it 's a question of realities .
nick higham : let 's move on to this question of how far - which you addressed earlier john - the newspapers and the media reflect public opinion and how far they create it .
mike , middlesbrough asks : the headlines reflect public opinion not the other way round .
we know that there are many thousands of people who should not be here .
so do the papers remind the politicians that the people are not going to be ignored forever ?
john torode : he 's put it very strongly .
he 's obviously very wound up about this issue and perhaps rightly .
but that is the job of the papers - yes .
nick higham : mike jempson , the papers surely have to do a job of reflecting this widespread public concern .
it would be ridiculous if they ignored it .
mike jempson : sure indeed .
it 's a very difficult one because recently there was another one of these mori polls and what was intriguing about that was that the facts and figures that people had , as it were , at their fingertips when asked questions , were precisely those which are promoted in certain newspapers which then the media picks up on and runs with .
so there 's a sense in which there is a lot of evidence to show that sort of popular myths have emerged from the newspapers and settled themselves in - whether you consider them to be prejudices or just inaccurate points of view - they 've settled into the public consciousness .
so there is some evidence that it is working that way - so it 's not reflecting but leading .
but certainly it is important to reflect and reflect upon public opinion .
but the other point to remember is that the daily express chose to make asylum one of its marketing techniques .
and over a period of a year , eighteen months , its sales went up by 17 % .
there was a great deal of criticism , even from its own journalists , about constantly running misleading headlines which did n't even fit the stories below .
but that was used as a way of selling the paper .
that 's selling prejudice .
there 's a lot of prejudiced people out there - they 're entitled to buy newspapers - but that 's the sort of thing that worries me , when it 's used as a marketing tool to sell a product .
nick higham : let 's talk about the language and actually this term asylum seeker itself .
we 've had a number of e-mails about this .
freddy brooks from the uk has just e-mailed us to say he believes that language does make a difference and says : why do the press persist with the use of the euphemism " asylum seeker " .
what we 're really talking about is trespass and theft if they apply after they break into our small island and do n't apply before making an illegal entry ?
neil d , netherlands asks : the main problem with this issue is that the term " asylum seekers " means people who are in fear for their lives and need a place of safety .
yet the uk is often not the first safe country refugees get to .
do you not agree they should be calling these people " economic migrants " which is what they are ?
phil caldwell , uk asks : i would like to know why the government and the media in general constantly refer to these people as asylum seekers .
why is it that these people feel they need to cross most of europe through at least eight democratic , free and safe countries to come to the uk ?
these people are not seeking asylum , they are seeking a better life under the guise of asylum .
mike jempson , do you think this term " asylum seeker " is one that we should abandon ?
mike jempson : yes - i 'm not sure what you 'd put in its place because there are , as your contributors pointed out , there lots and lots of different reasons and the term only means something at a certain point .
if i come into this country and apply for asylum , whether it 's immediately or when i get to a town and go to a police station - then i become an asylum seeker .
there 's a register of me having made this application and until a decision is taken , that term applies .
but let 's say , we 've been doing a lot of work with exiled journalist who 've been driven out of their countries for doing their job as journalists .
most of them have got to hide their identity .
they 've got to get across the world to somewhere safe - and many of them head for britain because of britain 's colonial past , for instance , and because it 's supposed to be the home of a free press .
now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .

launch interactive version click here to read the transcript the words ' asylum seeker ' have become an emotive phrase , arousing suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
negative media coverage and the language used in some political debates are seen as partly to blame .
headlines like ' asylum-on-sea ' and ' surrender to asylum ' have contributed to a widespread perception that the country is being overrun by refugees .
transcript nick higham : hello , i 'm nick higham and welcome to this bbc news interactive forum , our contribution to the bbc 's asylum day .
now what do you think of when you hear the phrase asylum seeker ?
is it a desperate refugee , a victim of harassment and perhaps even torture , fleeing persecution by an oppressive government ?
or a shiftless scrounger , one of an unsettling flood of foreigners invading the country , living off state benefits and stealing british citizens ' jobs ?
it 's an emotive phrase and it arouses suspicion , anger and frustration in almost equal measure .
so how much is media coverage of the asylum issue to blame for that ?
our television , radio and especially newspapers perpetuating negative and misleading stereotypes of what asylum seekers are .
with us to answer your questions are two journalists , john torode , writes for the daily mail , a paper which more than any other has become associated with the campaign against asylum seekers .
and joining us from bristol is mike jempson who runs presswise , which campaigns for greater fairness and accuracy in the media .
mike jempson , if i can ask you first , what 's your view very simply of the way the media in general - perhaps newspapers in particular report this issue ?
mike jempson : certain sections of the media have made it their special theme and it plays well to certain sorts of audiences .
and so the mail and the express and the sun in particular and the star have focused on extreme stories and perhaps especially extreme headlines .
and what we 've seen is the ideas embedded in those headlines have become part of popular mythology .
it 's a big story , it 's an important story but the way it 's handled can be disastrous for everybody concerned .
nick higham : john torode - extreme headlines , perpetuating or contributing to a popular mythology but presumably also reflecting widespread public opinion .
john torode : i think it is reflecting widespread public opinion .
i think that on the whole the tabloids do not create public moods , i think they reflect public moods - and that 's quite important and most of the academic research tends to back me on that .
can i just come back to one little point in your introduction which i thought was pretty sort of biased in itself - that the description of the daily mail - and i paraphrase that , i have n't got the words up in front of me - leading the campaign against asylum seekers , or words to that effect .
as i read the daily mail - and i 'm not a spokesman for the daily mail - but as i read the daily mail - the daily mail 's campaigning has been against illegal asylum seeking and the abuse of the system .
and every editorial i have ever written for the daily mail has always carried a paragraph pointing out the tremendous value to this country that asylum seekers have brought down the decades and down the centuries .
nick higham : do you think , mike jempson , that that 's a distinction that always comes across in the coverage - that illegal asylum seekers get lumped in with , as it were , legitimate asylum seekers ?
mike jempson : i think one of the problems is that a lot of the newspapers use terms the same .
so an asylum seeker and an illegal immigrant and a refugee are all represented as exactly the same - or an economic migrant or whatever is the term of the moment .
there were a series of stories last week in which those terms appeared in the same story and the headline and the subheading and the intro and in the early paragraphs - even though they all mean different things , they were used as if they were the same word .
now that does n't help people who are reading the papers to make those distinctions .
and i think there 's an additional problem in that the point that john has made , which is that the mail indeed does occasionally say , lots of refugees have added to the economy and we need people coming into the country , is that the target is very often the asylum seeker or the refugee and not government policy and i think that 's the danger .
you ca n't read your newspaper and turn around and do something about government policy especially if you 're not being given good facts and figures .
but what we have seen is increased attacks and criticism of anybody who does n't look as if they come from britain and that includes many people born here , as a result of these stories .
john torode : well i do n't think there are attacks upon asylum seekers as opposed to government policy .
but what i think is true is that there is a massive problem which scotland yard and the metropolitan police , which the government has recognised , of illegal criminal asylum seekers floating around our system .
tens of thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of them and those people it is as legitimate to " attack " those people in the press as it is to " attack " burglars , muggers , chaps who fiddle their income tax or anything else .
we 're talking about a significant number of foreign criminals in this country and those people merit criticism - they merit in that journalistic sense " attack " .
nick higham : well let 's move on to some of the e-mails we 've had .
the first one from jeremy hunter in the uk who asks : do you think that the attention and language that the media use not only exacerbates the issue but also leads to extremes of opinions because much of the media does not debate the issue but as they openly admit , campaign from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode , are you campaigning from an entrenched vantage point ?
john torode : well as i said to your earlier , i am not a spokesman for the daily mail .
but i think the entrenched vantage point of for example the fact that 20 years ago we had 4,000 asylum applications per year , we 're now getting 110,000 asylum applications .
i 'll give you just a couple of more statistics then i shall stop - 52 % of ethnic minorities , according to a recent mori poll , show that this country is regarded as a " soft touch " for illegal immigrants - for those who are fiddling the system as opposed to those who 've got a legitimate right to here .
there is a very real crisis .
the daily mail or other papers are campaigning against the abuse of the asylum system in the same what that you might campaign against street crime - it 's a bad idea to abuse the asylum system .
nick higham : mike jempson , do you think the way this is covered just forces both sides into extreme positions ?
mike jempson : well i think just listen to the language that the journalist just used .
first of all we have him using ethnic minorities as the people to - john torode : i want to come in on this .
i not going to be accused of racism .
nick higham : john torode says that he had not used the word ethnic minorities mike , so i think we have to accept that and i have to say i did n't hear it .
mike jempson : he just did when he was talking about this mori poll - saying that 52 % of ethnic minorities ¿ .
john torode : hang on , that was a poll about ethnic minorities - mike jempson : precisely , so do n't jump down my throat when i 've just quoted you accurately .
you used that expression as a way of defending people saying that there are too many asylum seekers here .
that 's just the point i was making .
then earlier , you talked about there being a massive problem of the country full of foreign criminals .
that 's the sort of thing that ratchets up the debate .
when you also say there 's been a massive increase in asylum applications - of course there has - think of how many more wars and environmental disasters or whatever there are around the world , that are driving people out of their countries .
it 's not surprising .
i 'm not saying that all of those people entering or attempting to enter the country have got a legitimate right to claim asylum , i 'm not saying that at all .
but using bald figures in the way that you have done and with the language that you have done , ratchets up to a situation where people feel that - going back to an earlier term you used - feel it 's ok to actually attack people and criticising government policy , actually attacking people , firebombing their homes or giving them a hard time on the streets .
that 's very irresponsible .
nick higham : this leads us on to another of the e-mails that we 've had which raises the question of whether it is possible to talk about this without people accusing one another of being racist .
tom from england asks : how much of a problem is it that people refuse to speak about the issue without the other side pulling out the bigot / race / ethnic card ?
james hooper , southend has just e-mailed us to say : do you think when the distinction between challenging asylum issues and racism becomes blurred by the press , it prevents people from having a decent debate as they 're scared of being branded as racist ?
john , you do n't seem to me to be scared , certainly of a decent debate .
john torode : i am not at all scared of being branded a racist .
i am fairly annoyed frankly with the way in which mike is behaving .
suddenly we lurch on from criticism to attacks to firebombs .
mike , stop being silly .
i 've put up with your sort of stupidity every day of the week , every time i write about this sort of issue .
you do n't disturb me .
you do n't frighten me and you do n't throw me by it .
now calm down , use sensible language and i 'll continue .
nick higham : i think asking mike to calm down in that way is itself potentially inflammatory john and mike i would be grateful if both of you could keep this at a level of reasonable calmness .
we are after all reasonable people and we should be discussing this in a reasonable and rational way .
tim , uk asks : are there any laws to prevent tabloid papers embellishing the truth about asylum for their own agenda , which often amounts to nothing more than racism ?
a lot of people believe what they read in the papers as fact , and this is not a healthy viewpoint to encourage .
mike jempson , you presumably endorse that .
mike jempson : yes .
i think one of the problems is that it is because of the way some of the issues are handled in the press .

because sometimes , if you read carefully the stories and if you inserted , jewish or irish or black or whatever , you can see that the copy is quite deliberately discriminatory and it winds people up .
now i think criticising , analysing government policy is a very important thing to do .
what worries me about a lot of the coverage is that it demonises particular people .

if you live in the sort of village where suddenly 750 genuine asylum seekers may well be - people who are still going through the system - going to be placed in one big bang , you know there 's a problem and you 're unhappy and it 's nothing to do with race and it 's nothing to do with stereotyping , it 's to do with a genuine problem .
nick higham : because that 's the other allegation .
that asylum seekers - bogus or otherwise - are spoken of in terms which are effectively racist because we would never use them to talk of blacks or asians or jews or other categories of people .

my point is , i 'm talking about white people , europeans there .
nick higham : mike you wanted to come back on bristol .
mike jempson : is n't that a rather pathetic line of argument about the distinction that 's being made between using asylum as a cover for racist commentary .
the point is that there are serious human problems and consequences both about the circumstances which drive people , whether they 're economic or otherwise , to come to countries like britain .

now when they enter the country , they may have to enter illegally and not through proper channels - because they wo n't have the right papers , they may have had to pay somebody to get them across borders , they may have false documents - for their own safety .
what do we call them ?
until they actually apply for asylum - what are you going to call them - illegal immigrants .
what are you going to call a women who i met recently in slovenia who 's family was being persecuted by the regime in iran and they paid to get on the back of a lorry and thought they were going to germany with the whole family and they were dropped on the street in slovenia and had no idea where they were .
they did n't even know that such a country existed .
there are many people who end up here who do n't even know they 're coming here .
they do n't know anything about where they 're coming to .
those people know nothing about the asylum system either .
so there are lots and lots of different types of people .
lots and lots of different types of reasons for coming and ways of coming .
we need to just try and find more accurate expressions .
nick higham : john torode , do you think that this phrase has become so widely used as to become almost meaningless and useless ?
john torode : it is widely abused i agree with you .
an asylum seeker is a fairly formal , as mike so rightly said , is a fairly formal definite status .
somebody who is seeking asylum - we know the persecution etc. etc . - and we need to differentiate between those people and those who are coming in simply as illegal immigrants because they wish to improve their economic lot or whatever it may be .
i do find asylum seeker as a very flat and neutral phrase .
it is not an insulting phrase , it is not a pejorative phrase .
it 's a flat phrase that describes a status .
nick higham : well it may have started out as that but the point is that with use it has ceased to be that .
john torode : then what do you do ?
there is a genuine problem with it - to be boringly journalistic about this - it 's a technical , legal status and it 's quite hard to get away from it .
i do n't how i would describe somebody who has formally applied for asylum in this country other than as an asylum seeker .
i do n't know what i would call them .
nick higham : it does n't seem then that we have an answer to that particular problem .
and also i 'm afraid we have run out of time .
so to both our contributors , mike jempson and john torode , my thanks .
my thanks also to you for your e-mails and contributions .
i 'm sorry we were n't able to deal with more of them .
this is obviously not a subject that is going to go away .
but equally , i suspect , the phrase , asylum seeker , is going to be with us for some time yet to come .
but for now goodbye .
