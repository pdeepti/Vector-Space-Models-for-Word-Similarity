blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .
today , the grandfather comes to work dressed in tails and a top hat and replies guests ‘ requests “ with pleasure “ instead of merely “ okay . “ and seiffert is not alone : of the 215 employees , 70 percent are from the region .
fifteen apprentices are due to start this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turret room .
of those who have found new hope in the resort , cleaning woman christina formell , unemployed for more than ten years , regards herself as particularly lucky .
“ the hotel is an improvement for the whole region , “ she said . indeed , the next of the 26 dilapidated buildings are due to be renovated next year , the hotel and golf course expanded and a new ayurveda centre added to the already abundant wellness area .
neighboring villages and a historic local train line are already profiting from an increase in both hotel guests and short-term visitors to heiligendamm . brushing the last specks of dust off a huge asian vase , formell packs her cleaner ’ s trolley for her next cleaning job : “ need any help ? “ a colleague in passing asks .
formell shakes her head .
“ the next station is the turret , “ she laughs . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea nations compromise on environmental protection north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .

decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .

founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .

“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with temperatures in some parts of germany reaching 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and even beyond , germans are fleeing the overheated concrete of cities for the cooler coast .
the result has been kilometer-long traffic jams , sunburned bathers and booked-out hotels .
some officials have said the demand for hotels during weekends is outstripping supply ten-fold . “ it ’ s a shame we don ’ t have twice as many hotels because demand is so great they could easily be filled , ” karin zabel , a spokeswoman in the mecklenburg-western pomerania economy ministry told reuters .
“ it ’ s the best summer ever for the baltic region . ” the summer tourism season here , often limited to two months , has been stretched to at least twice that this year . “ why spend money on a summer holiday abroad when it ’ s so warm and sunny here ? ”
michael keanist , 21 , asked a reporter . his countrymen and women share the opinion .
more and more germans prefer to stay close to home when they take their vacations .
around 58 percent of germans rank their own country number one when it comes to travel destinations . new hope for the region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mecklenburg-vorpommern , karte , bundesland , deutschland for years , mecklenburg-western pomerania was the forgotten corner of germany .
while the baltic was one of the few travel options available to citizens of the communist gdr , before the berlin wall fell , there were only five hotels in the region to choose from . but in the last ten years , some five billion euros have been invested in developing a tourism infrastructure .
a combination of state , federal and european union funds have been poured into the building of hotels , piers and beach boardwalks .
tourism has become the state ’ s biggest industry alongside agriculture and one in six jobs in the state depends on the travel trade .
tourism is growing faster here than in any other part of germany . that is good news for a region which has an unemployment rate close to 20 percent and where young people are often forced to move west to find work .
the skyrocketing growth of the tourism sector is providing the state with a source of hope for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one hot summer or global warming ?
despite subsequent years of freak weather , scientist ca n't say whether we should get used to heat waves in europe .
the jury is still out on global climate change .
record heat and drought hit europe a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes .
more space poolside as germans stay home despite the discomfort it 's causing , the hot summer has been embraced by tourists who are flocking back to resorts after last year 's lull .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with temperatures in some parts of germany reaching 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and even beyond , germans are fleeing the overheated concrete of cities for the cooler coast .
the result has been kilometer-long traffic jams , sunburned bathers and booked-out hotels .
some officials have said the demand for hotels during weekends is outstripping supply ten-fold . “ it ’ s a shame we don ’ t have twice as many hotels because demand is so great they could easily be filled , ” karin zabel , a spokeswoman in the mecklenburg-western pomerania economy ministry told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2003 government , opposition reach compromise on health reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details ironed out : health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- right -rrb- and opposition party negotiator horst seehofer .
government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .
health minister ulla schmidt and opposition christian democratic party / christian social party -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- health expert horst seehofer emerged friday morning from 13 hours of talks optimistic that the bill would be passed by parliament . " all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .
" the work has been completed , " announced seehofer . the suggestions , which have already been discussed with chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition leaders angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber -lrb- csu -rrb- , will be submitted to the parliamentary groups and committees from the ruling coalition parties and cdu / csu next week .
the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .
the draft foresees german residents taking out individual insurance policies to receive cover for dentures from 2005 .
they will also have to bear the burden of sick pay - which employees receive from the seventh week of illness - alone from 2006 . savings at the expense of the insured health insurance companies criticized the compromise on friday .

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .

" all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .

the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .
today , the grandfather comes to work dressed in tails and a top hat and replies guests ‘ requests “ with pleasure “ instead of merely “ okay . “ and seiffert is not alone : of the 215 employees , 70 percent are from the region .
fifteen apprentices are due to start this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turret room .
of those who have found new hope in the resort , cleaning woman christina formell , unemployed for more than ten years , regards herself as particularly lucky .
“ the hotel is an improvement for the whole region , “ she said . indeed , the next of the 26 dilapidated buildings are due to be renovated next year , the hotel and golf course expanded and a new ayurveda centre added to the already abundant wellness area .
neighboring villages and a historic local train line are already profiting from an increase in both hotel guests and short-term visitors to heiligendamm . brushing the last specks of dust off a huge asian vase , formell packs her cleaner ’ s trolley for her next cleaning job : “ need any help ? “ a colleague in passing asks .
formell shakes her head .
“ the next station is the turret , “ she laughs . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea nations compromise on environmental protection north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .

for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .

founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .

“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .
health minister ulla schmidt and opposition christian democratic party / christian social party -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- health expert horst seehofer emerged friday morning from 13 hours of talks optimistic that the bill would be passed by parliament . " all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .
" the work has been completed , " announced seehofer . the suggestions , which have already been discussed with chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition leaders angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber -lrb- csu -rrb- , will be submitted to the parliamentary groups and committees from the ruling coalition parties and cdu / csu next week .
the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .
the draft foresees german residents taking out individual insurance policies to receive cover for dentures from 2005 .
they will also have to bear the burden of sick pay - which employees receive from the seventh week of illness - alone from 2006 . savings at the expense of the insured health insurance companies criticized the compromise on friday .
" it is very one-sided at the expense of the people insured , since of the circa € 9 billion -lrb- $ 9.8 -rrb- we estimate in savings for 2004 , the people insured pay around 8 billion , a billion comes from the medication segment , " the head of the health insurance fund barmer ersatzkasse , eckart fiedler , said on deutschlandfunk radio .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with temperatures in some parts of germany reaching 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and even beyond , germans are fleeing the overheated concrete of cities for the cooler coast .
the result has been kilometer-long traffic jams , sunburned bathers and booked-out hotels .
some officials have said the demand for hotels during weekends is outstripping supply ten-fold . “ it ’ s a shame we don ’ t have twice as many hotels because demand is so great they could easily be filled , ” karin zabel , a spokeswoman in the mecklenburg-western pomerania economy ministry told reuters .
“ it ’ s the best summer ever for the baltic region . ” the summer tourism season here , often limited to two months , has been stretched to at least twice that this year . “ why spend money on a summer holiday abroad when it ’ s so warm and sunny here ? ”
michael keanist , 21 , asked a reporter . his countrymen and women share the opinion .
more and more germans prefer to stay close to home when they take their vacations .
around 58 percent of germans rank their own country number one when it comes to travel destinations . new hope for the region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mecklenburg-vorpommern , karte , bundesland , deutschland for years , mecklenburg-western pomerania was the forgotten corner of germany .
while the baltic was one of the few travel options available to citizens of the communist gdr , before the berlin wall fell , there were only five hotels in the region to choose from . but in the last ten years , some five billion euros have been invested in developing a tourism infrastructure .
a combination of state , federal and european union funds have been poured into the building of hotels , piers and beach boardwalks .
tourism has become the state ’ s biggest industry alongside agriculture and one in six jobs in the state depends on the travel trade .
tourism is growing faster here than in any other part of germany . that is good news for a region which has an unemployment rate close to 20 percent and where young people are often forced to move west to find work .
the skyrocketing growth of the tourism sector is providing the state with a source of hope for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one hot summer or global warming ?
despite subsequent years of freak weather , scientist ca n't say whether we should get used to heat waves in europe .
the jury is still out on global climate change .
record heat and drought hit europe a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes .
more space poolside as germans stay home despite the discomfort it 's causing , the hot summer has been embraced by tourists who are flocking back to resorts after last year 's lull .

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .
health minister ulla schmidt and opposition christian democratic party / christian social party -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- health expert horst seehofer emerged friday morning from 13 hours of talks optimistic that the bill would be passed by parliament . " all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .
" the work has been completed , " announced seehofer . the suggestions , which have already been discussed with chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition leaders angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber -lrb- csu -rrb- , will be submitted to the parliamentary groups and committees from the ruling coalition parties and cdu / csu next week .
the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .
the draft foresees german residents taking out individual insurance policies to receive cover for dentures from 2005 .
they will also have to bear the burden of sick pay - which employees receive from the seventh week of illness - alone from 2006 . savings at the expense of the insured health insurance companies criticized the compromise on friday .
" it is very one-sided at the expense of the people insured , since of the circa € 9 billion -lrb- $ 9.8 -rrb- we estimate in savings for 2004 , the people insured pay around 8 billion , a billion comes from the medication segment , " the head of the health insurance fund barmer ersatzkasse , eckart fiedler , said on deutschlandfunk radio .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .
today , the grandfather comes to work dressed in tails and a top hat and replies guests ‘ requests “ with pleasure “ instead of merely “ okay . “ and seiffert is not alone : of the 215 employees , 70 percent are from the region .
fifteen apprentices are due to start this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turret room .
of those who have found new hope in the resort , cleaning woman christina formell , unemployed for more than ten years , regards herself as particularly lucky .
“ the hotel is an improvement for the whole region , “ she said . indeed , the next of the 26 dilapidated buildings are due to be renovated next year , the hotel and golf course expanded and a new ayurveda centre added to the already abundant wellness area .
neighboring villages and a historic local train line are already profiting from an increase in both hotel guests and short-term visitors to heiligendamm . brushing the last specks of dust off a huge asian vase , formell packs her cleaner ’ s trolley for her next cleaning job : “ need any help ? “ a colleague in passing asks .
formell shakes her head .
“ the next station is the turret , “ she laughs . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea nations compromise on environmental protection north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with temperatures in some parts of germany reaching 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and even beyond , germans are fleeing the overheated concrete of cities for the cooler coast .
the result has been kilometer-long traffic jams , sunburned bathers and booked-out hotels .
some officials have said the demand for hotels during weekends is outstripping supply ten-fold . “ it ’ s a shame we don ’ t have twice as many hotels because demand is so great they could easily be filled , ” karin zabel , a spokeswoman in the mecklenburg-western pomerania economy ministry told reuters .
“ it ’ s the best summer ever for the baltic region . ” the summer tourism season here , often limited to two months , has been stretched to at least twice that this year . “ why spend money on a summer holiday abroad when it ’ s so warm and sunny here ? ”

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .
health minister ulla schmidt and opposition christian democratic party / christian social party -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- health expert horst seehofer emerged friday morning from 13 hours of talks optimistic that the bill would be passed by parliament . " all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .
" the work has been completed , " announced seehofer . the suggestions , which have already been discussed with chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition leaders angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber -lrb- csu -rrb- , will be submitted to the parliamentary groups and committees from the ruling coalition parties and cdu / csu next week .
the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .
the draft foresees german residents taking out individual insurance policies to receive cover for dentures from 2005 .
they will also have to bear the burden of sick pay - which employees receive from the seventh week of illness - alone from 2006 . savings at the expense of the insured health insurance companies criticized the compromise on friday .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .

the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with temperatures in some parts of germany reaching 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and even beyond , germans are fleeing the overheated concrete of cities for the cooler coast .
the result has been kilometer-long traffic jams , sunburned bathers and booked-out hotels .
some officials have said the demand for hotels during weekends is outstripping supply ten-fold . “ it ’ s a shame we don ’ t have twice as many hotels because demand is so great they could easily be filled , ” karin zabel , a spokeswoman in the mecklenburg-western pomerania economy ministry told reuters .
“ it ’ s the best summer ever for the baltic region . ” the summer tourism season here , often limited to two months , has been stretched to at least twice that this year . “ why spend money on a summer holiday abroad when it ’ s so warm and sunny here ? ”
michael keanist , 21 , asked a reporter . his countrymen and women share the opinion .
more and more germans prefer to stay close to home when they take their vacations .
around 58 percent of germans rank their own country number one when it comes to travel destinations . new hope for the region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mecklenburg-vorpommern , karte , bundesland , deutschland for years , mecklenburg-western pomerania was the forgotten corner of germany .
while the baltic was one of the few travel options available to citizens of the communist gdr , before the berlin wall fell , there were only five hotels in the region to choose from . but in the last ten years , some five billion euros have been invested in developing a tourism infrastructure .
a combination of state , federal and european union funds have been poured into the building of hotels , piers and beach boardwalks .
tourism has become the state ’ s biggest industry alongside agriculture and one in six jobs in the state depends on the travel trade .
tourism is growing faster here than in any other part of germany . that is good news for a region which has an unemployment rate close to 20 percent and where young people are often forced to move west to find work .
the skyrocketing growth of the tourism sector is providing the state with a source of hope for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one hot summer or global warming ?
despite subsequent years of freak weather , scientist ca n't say whether we should get used to heat waves in europe .
the jury is still out on global climate change .
record heat and drought hit europe a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes .
more space poolside as germans stay home despite the discomfort it 's causing , the hot summer has been embraced by tourists who are flocking back to resorts after last year 's lull .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .
today , the grandfather comes to work dressed in tails and a top hat and replies guests ‘ requests “ with pleasure “ instead of merely “ okay . “ and seiffert is not alone : of the 215 employees , 70 percent are from the region .
fifteen apprentices are due to start this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turret room .
of those who have found new hope in the resort , cleaning woman christina formell , unemployed for more than ten years , regards herself as particularly lucky .
“ the hotel is an improvement for the whole region , “ she said . indeed , the next of the 26 dilapidated buildings are due to be renovated next year , the hotel and golf course expanded and a new ayurveda centre added to the already abundant wellness area .
neighboring villages and a historic local train line are already profiting from an increase in both hotel guests and short-term visitors to heiligendamm . brushing the last specks of dust off a huge asian vase , formell packs her cleaner ’ s trolley for her next cleaning job : “ need any help ? “ a colleague in passing asks .
formell shakes her head .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .

in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .
health minister ulla schmidt and opposition christian democratic party / christian social party -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- health expert horst seehofer emerged friday morning from 13 hours of talks optimistic that the bill would be passed by parliament . " all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .
" the work has been completed , " announced seehofer . the suggestions , which have already been discussed with chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition leaders angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber -lrb- csu -rrb- , will be submitted to the parliamentary groups and committees from the ruling coalition parties and cdu / csu next week .
the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .
the draft foresees german residents taking out individual insurance policies to receive cover for dentures from 2005 .
they will also have to bear the burden of sick pay - which employees receive from the seventh week of illness - alone from 2006 . savings at the expense of the insured health insurance companies criticized the compromise on friday .
" it is very one-sided at the expense of the people insured , since of the circa € 9 billion -lrb- $ 9.8 -rrb- we estimate in savings for 2004 , the people insured pay around 8 billion , a billion comes from the medication segment , " the head of the health insurance fund barmer ersatzkasse , eckart fiedler , said on deutschlandfunk radio .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .
today , the grandfather comes to work dressed in tails and a top hat and replies guests ‘ requests “ with pleasure “ instead of merely “ okay . “ and seiffert is not alone : of the 215 employees , 70 percent are from the region .
fifteen apprentices are due to start this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turret room .
of those who have found new hope in the resort , cleaning woman christina formell , unemployed for more than ten years , regards herself as particularly lucky .
“ the hotel is an improvement for the whole region , “ she said . indeed , the next of the 26 dilapidated buildings are due to be renovated next year , the hotel and golf course expanded and a new ayurveda centre added to the already abundant wellness area .
neighboring villages and a historic local train line are already profiting from an increase in both hotel guests and short-term visitors to heiligendamm . brushing the last specks of dust off a huge asian vase , formell packs her cleaner ’ s trolley for her next cleaning job : “ need any help ? “ a colleague in passing asks .
formell shakes her head .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with temperatures in some parts of germany reaching 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and even beyond , germans are fleeing the overheated concrete of cities for the cooler coast .
the result has been kilometer-long traffic jams , sunburned bathers and booked-out hotels .
some officials have said the demand for hotels during weekends is outstripping supply ten-fold . “ it ’ s a shame we don ’ t have twice as many hotels because demand is so great they could easily be filled , ” karin zabel , a spokeswoman in the mecklenburg-western pomerania economy ministry told reuters .
“ it ’ s the best summer ever for the baltic region . ” the summer tourism season here , often limited to two months , has been stretched to at least twice that this year . “ why spend money on a summer holiday abroad when it ’ s so warm and sunny here ? ”
michael keanist , 21 , asked a reporter . his countrymen and women share the opinion .
more and more germans prefer to stay close to home when they take their vacations .
around 58 percent of germans rank their own country number one when it comes to travel destinations . new hope for the region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mecklenburg-vorpommern , karte , bundesland , deutschland for years , mecklenburg-western pomerania was the forgotten corner of germany .
while the baltic was one of the few travel options available to citizens of the communist gdr , before the berlin wall fell , there were only five hotels in the region to choose from . but in the last ten years , some five billion euros have been invested in developing a tourism infrastructure .
a combination of state , federal and european union funds have been poured into the building of hotels , piers and beach boardwalks .
tourism has become the state ’ s biggest industry alongside agriculture and one in six jobs in the state depends on the travel trade .
tourism is growing faster here than in any other part of germany . that is good news for a region which has an unemployment rate close to 20 percent and where young people are often forced to move west to find work .
the skyrocketing growth of the tourism sector is providing the state with a source of hope for the future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one hot summer or global warming ?
despite subsequent years of freak weather , scientist ca n't say whether we should get used to heat waves in europe .
the jury is still out on global climate change .
record heat and drought hit europe a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes .
more space poolside as germans stay home despite the discomfort it 's causing , the hot summer has been embraced by tourists who are flocking back to resorts after last year 's lull .

blazing heat this summer has proved to be a boon for germany 's baltic coast .
tourists flocking to the seaside to escape rising temperature are boosting the economy of one of the country ’ s poorest regions . there are a lot of beds in the hotels and pensions dotted along eastern germany ’ s baltic sea coast - according to tourism officials , around 164,650 .
but this summer , actually reserving one of those beds for a last-minute seaside holiday is next to impossible .
the summer on the baltic is booked out . “ hotels everywhere are full , ” enthused uwe hanush , manager at the luxury maritim hotel in the coastal town of heringsdorf .
“ it ’ s the best summer we ’ ve ever seen .
we ’ re all profiting from the sun . ” the sun is indeed bringing unaccustomed profits to mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northeastern state that hugs the baltic coast and one of germany ’ s poorest and smallest .
the unusually balmy climate over the past two months has sparked an unexpected boom in the region , helping this long-neglected and economically-depressed area become the country ’ s most popular tourist destination . sunny days , sold-out rooms the summer of 2003 has been one of the hottest on record , and the baltic has enjoyed more than six weeks of uninterrupted sunshine , a rarity in this region of mercilessly short summers that are often best viewed from under an umbrella .
the sea , often chilly and grey on the best of days , has warmed up to five degrees above normal , taking on a near mediterranean flavor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with temperatures in some parts of germany reaching 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and even beyond , germans are fleeing the overheated concrete of cities for the cooler coast .
the result has been kilometer-long traffic jams , sunburned bathers and booked-out hotels .
some officials have said the demand for hotels during weekends is outstripping supply ten-fold . “ it ’ s a shame we don ’ t have twice as many hotels because demand is so great they could easily be filled , ” karin zabel , a spokeswoman in the mecklenburg-western pomerania economy ministry told reuters .
“ it ’ s the best summer ever for the baltic region . ” the summer tourism season here , often limited to two months , has been stretched to at least twice that this year . “ why spend money on a summer holiday abroad when it ’ s so warm and sunny here ? ”

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .
health minister ulla schmidt and opposition christian democratic party / christian social party -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- health expert horst seehofer emerged friday morning from 13 hours of talks optimistic that the bill would be passed by parliament . " all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .
" the work has been completed , " announced seehofer . the suggestions , which have already been discussed with chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition leaders angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber -lrb- csu -rrb- , will be submitted to the parliamentary groups and committees from the ruling coalition parties and cdu / csu next week .
the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .
the draft foresees german residents taking out individual insurance policies to receive cover for dentures from 2005 .
they will also have to bear the burden of sick pay - which employees receive from the seventh week of illness - alone from 2006 . savings at the expense of the insured health insurance companies criticized the compromise on friday .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .
today , the grandfather comes to work dressed in tails and a top hat and replies guests ‘ requests “ with pleasure “ instead of merely “ okay . “ and seiffert is not alone : of the 215 employees , 70 percent are from the region .
fifteen apprentices are due to start this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turret room .
of those who have found new hope in the resort , cleaning woman christina formell , unemployed for more than ten years , regards herself as particularly lucky .
“ the hotel is an improvement for the whole region , “ she said . indeed , the next of the 26 dilapidated buildings are due to be renovated next year , the hotel and golf course expanded and a new ayurveda centre added to the already abundant wellness area .
neighboring villages and a historic local train line are already profiting from an increase in both hotel guests and short-term visitors to heiligendamm . brushing the last specks of dust off a huge asian vase , formell packs her cleaner ’ s trolley for her next cleaning job : “ need any help ? “ a colleague in passing asks .
formell shakes her head .
“ the next station is the turret , “ she laughs . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea nations compromise on environmental protection north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .

government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .
health minister ulla schmidt and opposition christian democratic party / christian social party -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- health expert horst seehofer emerged friday morning from 13 hours of talks optimistic that the bill would be passed by parliament . " all questions have been resolved , " said schmidt .
" the work has been completed , " announced seehofer . the suggestions , which have already been discussed with chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition leaders angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- and edmund stoiber -lrb- csu -rrb- , will be submitted to the parliamentary groups and committees from the ruling coalition parties and cdu / csu next week .
the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .
the draft foresees german residents taking out individual insurance policies to receive cover for dentures from 2005 .
they will also have to bear the burden of sick pay - which employees receive from the seventh week of illness - alone from 2006 . savings at the expense of the insured health insurance companies criticized the compromise on friday .
" it is very one-sided at the expense of the people insured , since of the circa € 9 billion -lrb- $ 9.8 -rrb- we estimate in savings for 2004 , the people insured pay around 8 billion , a billion comes from the medication segment , " the head of the health insurance fund barmer ersatzkasse , eckart fiedler , said on deutschlandfunk radio .
" that means all the others make no contribution .

for many years , germany 's first official bathing resort - a majestic complex of elegant white buildings on the baltic sea - was left to decay .
this summer a new chapter for both tourists and locals began in heiligendamm . christina formell ’ s favorite room is in the turret .
up here , a sparkling deep blue sea mingles with the sky , seagulls glide past the turret ’ s open windows and shafts of sunlight throw dancing shadows over pale yellow walls .
for many years , thick , dusty curtains barred the sun ’ s way to this dingy chamber , a room which once housed patients suffering under chronic skin illnesses .
once a place she preferred to avoid , former nurse formell now likes to linger here .
" for me the room is a reminder , “ she said .
" it 's a reminder of how heiligendamm has changed . “ change has become a constant in heiligendamm , a small seaside resort on germany ’ s eastern baltic sea coast .
founded in 1793 as germany ’ s first official bathing resort , it soon became one of europe ’ s leading destinations to recuperate and relax by the sea .
once frequented by european royalty , who danced long nights away on polished wooden floors and dined to the hush of the sea within its gleaming white walls , heiligendamm slowly saw its steady decline as a dingy sanatorium for the chronically sick under the communist east german regime .
decay soon followed decline after its 1990 closure , which also led to economic depression in the surrounding region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kempinski grand hotel heiligendamm this year saw the start of a new chapter in the history of a resort many thought of as long belonging to germany 's past : in june , after three years of extensive rebuilding and restoration , leading hotel chain kempinski opened a gleaming new five star hotel in six of the existing 26 buildings which form heiligendamm .
" with the hotel , the history of heiligendamm is being revived , ” said formell , a local who after ten years unemployment now works at kempinski as a cleaning woman . jade from asia it is late morning in heiligendamm .
at this time of the day , the ballroom is empty save for a solitary young woman in a well-ironed uniform , folding a pile of light blue napkins .
here , more than three centuries ago , germany ’ s upper classes would dance the nights away . today , it is silent , except for the soft click of beatrice schwarz ‘ shoes on the polished floor .
“ the hotel is a reflection of what heiligendamm once used to be , “ kempinski spokeswoman schwarz told deutsche welle .
“ it is a reminder of its past as a mundane recuperation resort combined with the present-day demands of a modern , international luxury hotel . “ indeed , past and present come together in all corners of the hotel .
jade friezes from asia adorn long , elegant corridors : a tribute to the tradition of former dukes who indulged in the collection of exotic treasures from trips to far off asia .
in the bathrooms , italian marble lines walls and floors .
and in the dining room , hand woven chinese silk , the colour of a sun-spoiled sea , covers high , lofty walls while huge chandeliers , each weighing 210 kilograms , reflect the ocean ’ s incessant sparkle .
“ despite being a hotel , its role as traditional seaside spa-resort remains unforgotten , “ schwarz said as she led the way through bedrooms in various sea-greens , blues and shades of sandy brown .
“ the hotel ’ s interior therefore is a reflection of both its past , and its surroundings . “ horse racing and snail farm the most striking reminder of heiligendamm 's past is a huge stone , set in a lush green lawn inscribed with the name of its founder .
founded by the duke of mecklenburg-schwerin , franz ferdinand , as germany 's first bathing resort , heiligendamm soon came to be known as the “ white town on the sea . “ such was the striking appearance of a row of majestic white buildings along the baltic seafront , which followed , villa for villa , in the years after ferdinand ’ s – medically recommended - first sea bath , that the resort quickly turned a popular destination for the rich and royal to relax . not only did heiligendamm pride in an exceptionally pure air due to its dense surrounding beech forests , clean waters and very own sulphur sources , it soon surpassed other resorts with an array of upper-class friendly pastimes : horse racing in 1804 , tennis in 1888 , ball dancing , dining , in 1925 a golf course and – a tribute to its acclaimed cuisine - heiligendamm ’ s very own gourmet snail farm . many of these pastimes , after almost a century of absence , have seen their rebirth with the redevelopment of the former holiday resort .
holidaymakers today can again play golf , go to the horse races , dine and dance and , in the heiligendamm tradition , revel in the hotel ’ s wide selection of health and wellness treatments . the idea of holidaymaking where once kings laid their heads to rest appears to have caught on : even before the official re-opening in june , the hotel was booked out .
during the summer , reservations filled two thirds of the 225 rooms , in particular the more expensive suites .
“ the name heiligendamm still rings a nostalgic bell .
it is this reputation that we wish to continue , “ schwarz said . new hope but not all things are as glossy as they may seem , up here on the former east german sea coast .
many people in the area resent the opening of a glamorous hotel and wish for a more public and less affected usage .
on the other side , guests have been reported to have complained of feeling “ like in a zoo “ due to the many people who come from far afield not to stay but simply to take a look . some , however , have welcomed the changes in heiligendamm .
former taxi driver günther seiffert had long given up hopes of rosy prospects in his work life before being taken on as doorman in the spring this year .
today , the grandfather comes to work dressed in tails and a top hat and replies guests ‘ requests “ with pleasure “ instead of merely “ okay . “ and seiffert is not alone : of the 215 employees , 70 percent are from the region .
fifteen apprentices are due to start this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turret room .
of those who have found new hope in the resort , cleaning woman christina formell , unemployed for more than ten years , regards herself as particularly lucky .
“ the hotel is an improvement for the whole region , “ she said . indeed , the next of the 26 dilapidated buildings are due to be renovated next year , the hotel and golf course expanded and a new ayurveda centre added to the already abundant wellness area .
neighboring villages and a historic local train line are already profiting from an increase in both hotel guests and short-term visitors to heiligendamm . brushing the last specks of dust off a huge asian vase , formell packs her cleaner ’ s trolley for her next cleaning job : “ need any help ? “ a colleague in passing asks .
formell shakes her head .

critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets . german government and opposition parties on friday morning reached agreement on a draft for crucial new legislation on health care reform .

the bill could become law by early next year . the two sides had agreed on the central features of the reform weeks ago , but several issues , such as financing dentures and sick pay , remained contentious .

the average lifespan of men in the city is more than a decade shorter than in north dorset , which tops the list for longevity .
the office for national statistics survey said that the life expectancy for women was 7.2 years less than in west somerset .
health officials blamed poverty for the city 's bad record - but insisted that steps were being taken to improve the situation .
the figures relate to life expectancy at birth in 1999-2001 .
the survey said that men could expect to live for an average of 68.7 years in glasgow .
lowest male life expectancy glasgow - 68.7 manchester - 69.8 inverclyde - 70.3 west dunbartonshire - 70.8 renfrewshire - 71.7 dundee - 71.8 north lanarkshire - 71.8 blackpool - 72 liverpool - 72 western isles - 72.3 the life expectancy for women in the city was estimated at 76.2 years .
scottish council areas accounted for seven of the 10 areas with the lowest life expectancy for men , and six out of 10 for women .
west dunbartonshire and inverclyde also featured in the worst five areas for both men and women .
north dorset was the area with the highest male life expectancy , with an average age of 79.3 .
christchurch recorded a similar figure , with east dorset in third place .
west somerset was top for women , with an average age of 83.4 , followed by purbeck and guildford .
' getting better ' evelyn borland , acting director of health promotion with nhs greater glasgow , identified poverty and deprivation as the causes of the city 's poor health record .
she said : " glasgow 's health record wo n't change overnight , but things are getting better .
" major changes are taking place on a city-wide level for the social and physical regeneration of glasgow , improving the areas where people live .
lowest female life expectancy glasgow - 76.2 manchester - 76.5 east ayrshire - 76.7 west dunbartonshire - 77.2 inverclyde - 77.2 liverpool - 77.3 north lanarkshire - 77.5 wansbeck - 77.6 merthyr tydfil - 77.6 renfrewshire - 77.7 " as well as working with the local authority and other agencies on city-wide initiatives to make it easier for people to access healthier lifestyles , we are committed to supporting the wide range of innovative work being carried out by deprived communities themselves . "
scottish national party health spokeswoman shona robison said the statistics were " a national scandal " .
she said : " these figures show that after six full years in power in westminster and four years in the scottish parliament , labour has completely failed to tackle the underlying problems of poverty and deprivation which lead to low life expectancy .
" under labour , the life expectancy gap between the top and bottom is widening . "
a spokesman for the scottish executive said there was " no short-term fix " .
he added : " the executive is committed to improve health leaving and life expectancy for all men and women living and scotland and to reduce the inequalities of life expectancy between the most affluent and most deprived . "

the average lifespan of men in the city is more than a decade shorter than in north dorset , which tops the list for longevity .
the office for national statistics survey said that the life expectancy for women was 7.2 years less than in west somerset .
health officials blamed poverty for the city 's bad record - but insisted that steps were being taken to improve the situation .
the figures relate to life expectancy at birth in 1999-2001 .
the survey said that men could expect to live for an average of 68.7 years in glasgow .
lowest male life expectancy glasgow - 68.7 manchester - 69.8 inverclyde - 70.3 west dunbartonshire - 70.8 renfrewshire - 71.7 dundee - 71.8 north lanarkshire - 71.8 blackpool - 72 liverpool - 72 western isles - 72.3 the life expectancy for women in the city was estimated at 76.2 years .
scottish council areas accounted for seven of the 10 areas with the lowest life expectancy for men , and six out of 10 for women .
west dunbartonshire and inverclyde also featured in the worst five areas for both men and women .
north dorset was the area with the highest male life expectancy , with an average age of 79.3 .
christchurch recorded a similar figure , with east dorset in third place .
west somerset was top for women , with an average age of 83.4 , followed by purbeck and guildford .
' getting better ' evelyn borland , acting director of health promotion with nhs greater glasgow , identified poverty and deprivation as the causes of the city 's poor health record .
she said : " glasgow 's health record wo n't change overnight , but things are getting better .
" major changes are taking place on a city-wide level for the social and physical regeneration of glasgow , improving the areas where people live .
lowest female life expectancy glasgow - 76.2 manchester - 76.5 east ayrshire - 76.7 west dunbartonshire - 77.2 inverclyde - 77.2 liverpool - 77.3 north lanarkshire - 77.5 wansbeck - 77.6 merthyr tydfil - 77.6 renfrewshire - 77.7 " as well as working with the local authority and other agencies on city-wide initiatives to make it easier for people to access healthier lifestyles , we are committed to supporting the wide range of innovative work being carried out by deprived communities themselves . "
scottish national party health spokeswoman shona robison said the statistics were " a national scandal " .
she said : " these figures show that after six full years in power in westminster and four years in the scottish parliament , labour has completely failed to tackle the underlying problems of poverty and deprivation which lead to low life expectancy .
" under labour , the life expectancy gap between the top and bottom is widening . "
a spokesman for the scottish executive said there was " no short-term fix " .
he added : " the executive is committed to improve health leaving and life expectancy for all men and women living and scotland and to reduce the inequalities of life expectancy between the most affluent and most deprived . "

a company aiming to grab a share in the bt 192 business is creating 550 new jobs in cardiff .
but the communications workers union said that fierce competition in this sector would mean that some jobs would only be temporary .
the number , which is based at cardiff gate , is one of several companies hoping to dominate the directory enquiries market when bt 's 192 service is switched off this weekend .
instead , subscribers will have to dial a six-digit number beginning with 118 .
the us-owned company , which has launched the 118 118 service , said 700 permanent posts will be filled in cardiff and plymouth over the next week .
the firm will have then created 2,000 jobs since last september at an average rate of 150 posts a month .
for months several companies have set up call centres hoping to take business off bt .
the number already employs 700 at its cardiff call centre and friday 's announcement boosts that to 1250 .
another firm , conduit , employs a similar number at two call centres , one in cardiff and another in swansea .
fierce competition the 118 services are now a major employer in wales , but union leaders are already warning that fierce competition may lead to job cuts over time .
the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- said it feared many of the new jobs would only be temporary , claiming that some workers were on minimum wage rates despite working long hours in stressful conditions .
the number will be one of at least 15 companies offering directory enquiry services when the old 192 is switched off at one minute past midnight on sunday morning .
" we are extremely pleased to announce this further wave of british jobs to meet the growing demand for 118 118 , " said chief executive chris moss .
analysts say the new market will create 3,500 new jobs " the welcome , skills and commitment we have found in cardiff and plymouth has been a tremendous boost - there is no reason why the uk can not be the best in the world . "
the cwu does not have recognition rights at many of the new companies but fears that pay rates could be lower that the industry average .
bt pays about £ 15,000 to its directory enquiry staff , but that figure is at the higher end of the scale .
pay rates of £ 11,500 or lower are more typical .
the cwu is fighting plans by bt to transfer directory enquiry work to two new call centres in india and it suspects some of the new entrants will have centres in overseas countries , including malaysia and hong kong .
staff working in the uk and ireland will be working from call centres in areas including dublin , dumfries , birmingham , glasgow , and south wales .
some industry analysts have estimated that opening up the market will create 3,500 new jobs , but few expect all the new entrants to remain in the business indefinitely .

chief executive sir martin sorrell , who famously predicted over a year ago that the advertising downturn would be " bath-shaped " , said : " certainly , it seems as though we are starting to climb out of the bath . "
spending boost wpp is pinning it hopes of a recovery on the us , where it suggested preparations for the 2005 presidential elections should provide a much-needed boost to sales .
" the growth in us spending is currently greater than at any other time since the vietnam war in 1967 , " wpp said .
advertising spending ahead of the election should help wpp and its peers , as should massive marketing budgets linked with the olympic games in athens and the european football championship in portugal , chief executive sir martin sorrell told bbc world business report .
it added that the athens olympic games and the portuguese european football championship " bode well for the prospects for 2004 " .
the advertising industry has been squeezed by companies cutting their expenditure in response to the economic downturn .
wpp shares were unchanged at 570p in early trade in london .

some viruses try to trick people into opening them it is rare that people have more than one personal encounter with a virus as anyone caught out once tends to work hard to avoid a second infection .
but for some security hi-tech workers the job of fighting off viruses and their malicious ilk is a 24-hour , seven-day-a-week task .
it is a job that requires constant vigilance and many security firms run network monitoring centres to keep an eye on their customers ' networks and the shifting tide of computer vandalism and crime .
the operation centres are the frontline of the information war .
attack pattern symantec 's european network operation centre sits inside a underground bunker in the wiltshire countryside .
bunker staff sit in air-conditioned comfort beyond blast doors and have fuel and water to survive for days without aid should the need arise .
jeff ogden , manager of the european operations centre , says the number of potential security problems and the speed at which they are exploited is accelerating .
in 2002 the number of vulnerabilities found in software grew by more than 80 % .
worryingly most of this growth was due to bugs rated as moderate or severe threats .
to make matters worse the time between vulnerability being discovered and exploited is shrinking .
more networks means more ways for viruses to travel mr ogden said three years ago the time delay between discovery and exploit was about 500 days .
" now it is down to 40 days , " he said .
some are faster than that .
the vulnerability exploited by the msblast or lovsan worm was discovered less than 30 days before the worm appeared .
" most of the threats are following technology so the problem is not going to get any easier for people , " says mr ogden .
he says the number of attacks launched from a country are directly proportional to the broadband penetration .
south korea , which has a very high proportion of broadband users , is rapidly becoming a locus of net attacks .
many of them are not launched by koreans , instead they are carried out by proxy using pcs sitting on a broadband link that have been compromised by attackers .
threat assessment symantec customers get attacked , on average , 35 times per week and 10-15 new viruses are discovered every day .
" this is not background noise anymore , " said kevin hogan , head of the symantec 's security response centre in dublin .
many of the threats discovered are dealt with automatically as the viruses are simply variants that are easy to spot or copycat attacks .
ogden : threats follow technology but life is also made difficult for symantec staff thanks to what mr ogden calls " flash threats " .
these malicious programs pop-up , spread with alarming speed and are almost impossible to defend against .
all people can do is react .
the slammer worm was a good example of a " flash threat " as it managed to reach almost all vulnerable machines on the net within 15 minutes of its first appearance .
mr ogden says symantec 's operations centres automatically grab information from 20,000 sensors on the networks it watches .
now it has more than 30 terabytes of database to analyse to spot impending security problems or someone somewhere preparing to attack .
" it makes the data meaningful , " says mr ogden , " if you look at 200 incidents you may never connect them together . "
it is the job of the symantec security team to work out what is happening and do something about it .
they use well-known tools such as sam spade to track down the source of an attack or simply analyse a virus to discover how it works , how to spot it and how to fix the problems it causes .
mr hogan said : " there 's a common interest within the industry to try to deal with these things before they become a threat to customers or the rest of the internet . "

some viruses try to trick people into opening them it is rare that people have more than one personal encounter with a virus as anyone caught out once tends to work hard to avoid a second infection .
but for some security hi-tech workers the job of fighting off viruses and their malicious ilk is a 24-hour , seven-day-a-week task .
it is a job that requires constant vigilance and many security firms run network monitoring centres to keep an eye on their customers ' networks and the shifting tide of computer vandalism and crime .
the operation centres are the frontline of the information war .
attack pattern symantec 's european network operation centre sits inside a underground bunker in the wiltshire countryside .
bunker staff sit in air-conditioned comfort beyond blast doors and have fuel and water to survive for days without aid should the need arise .
jeff ogden , manager of the european operations centre , says the number of potential security problems and the speed at which they are exploited is accelerating .
in 2002 the number of vulnerabilities found in software grew by more than 80 % .
worryingly most of this growth was due to bugs rated as moderate or severe threats .
to make matters worse the time between vulnerability being discovered and exploited is shrinking .
more networks means more ways for viruses to travel mr ogden said three years ago the time delay between discovery and exploit was about 500 days .
" now it is down to 40 days , " he said .
some are faster than that .
the vulnerability exploited by the msblast or lovsan worm was discovered less than 30 days before the worm appeared .
" most of the threats are following technology so the problem is not going to get any easier for people , " says mr ogden .
he says the number of attacks launched from a country are directly proportional to the broadband penetration .
south korea , which has a very high proportion of broadband users , is rapidly becoming a locus of net attacks .
many of them are not launched by koreans , instead they are carried out by proxy using pcs sitting on a broadband link that have been compromised by attackers .
threat assessment symantec customers get attacked , on average , 35 times per week and 10-15 new viruses are discovered every day .
" this is not background noise anymore , " said kevin hogan , head of the symantec 's security response centre in dublin .
many of the threats discovered are dealt with automatically as the viruses are simply variants that are easy to spot or copycat attacks .
ogden : threats follow technology but life is also made difficult for symantec staff thanks to what mr ogden calls " flash threats " .
these malicious programs pop-up , spread with alarming speed and are almost impossible to defend against .
all people can do is react .
the slammer worm was a good example of a " flash threat " as it managed to reach almost all vulnerable machines on the net within 15 minutes of its first appearance .
mr ogden says symantec 's operations centres automatically grab information from 20,000 sensors on the networks it watches .
now it has more than 30 terabytes of database to analyse to spot impending security problems or someone somewhere preparing to attack .
" it makes the data meaningful , " says mr ogden , " if you look at 200 incidents you may never connect them together . "
it is the job of the symantec security team to work out what is happening and do something about it .
they use well-known tools such as sam spade to track down the source of an attack or simply analyse a virus to discover how it works , how to spot it and how to fix the problems it causes .

but they are unlikely to be affected by the million people coming to west london this weekend for the carnival - unlike those running businesses who see it as a mixed blessing .
tony kite , manager of restaurant lucky seven , said over the two days he will make an extra £ 2,000 .
" we wo n't be opening the shop up but we 've been granted a licence for a bar , which will serve both food and drinks , to be set up outside , " he said .
" last year we made around £ 6,000 over the carnival weekend .
on a normal weekend we take about £ 4,000 . "
have your say i hope it is moved before there is a disaster andrew witham , uk send us your comments but mirdula desai , who runs a londis newsagent , said they had opened for carnival for 26 years but closed for the last seven because it had become too busy .
" we used to take on extra staff but now it 's just not worth it , " she said .
" it 's too hectic in here at the best of times and during the carnival , especially as it is now much bigger than before , it is too much . "
one off-licence owner , who did not want to be named , said he looked forward to the carnival saying " it was the best weekend of the year " .
' area boarded up ' " during the carnival it does get really , really busy and it 's hard to cope sometimes - but my bank manager is not complaining and neither am i. "
but for others , like anthony morris , it can be a nightmare .
he runs crucial trading , a carpet and rugs design business , which he said could lose up to £ 50,000 over the bank holiday weekend .
" in past years people have asked to use my toilet and i have let them , but then i get inundated with people who want to use it and then leave a mess .
jane appleby-deen is boarding up as a precaution " since then i 've closed over the weekend and when i 've come back i have found people have urinated up the shop front or left rubbish , usually food , and i have to clean it up because the council refuses to .
" on a good weekend i can make between £ 40,000 to £ 50,000 , which i lose when i 'm forced to shut .
" it 's now far too big for the area .
" if you just look around and see the area being boarded up - it 's like we are preparing for war not carnival - it should be moved to somewhere like hyde park . "
jane appleby-deen has run appleby , a high quality vintage clothing business , for six months and has decided to board the shop up as a " precaution " .
graffiti artist seal gets to work legitimately " i love the carnival and i 'm glad it is happening because it is brilliant , " she said .
" but it only takes one drunk person or someone being silly for someone to be thrown through the glass and hurt themselves . "
for one teenager the carnival means he can legitimately use his graffiti skills to decorate the route .
' seal ' , 15 , said : " i have been doing this for the last few years and i can do it without the police giving me hassle .
" i love carnival . "

the indian government now says tests it has authorised show that the drinks are safe and the cse 's findings were wrong .
the cse has been operating in india for more than 20 years .
it is a non-government organisation that describes its goal as the promotion of environmentally sound and equitable development strategies .
the cse has run two successful campaigns in india in recent years .
its efforts in the 1990s forced the government in the capital , delhi , to adopt environmentally-friendly fuel compressed natural gas -lrb- cng -rrb- in the city buses to reduce pollution .
this year , a study conducted by the group revealed that most of the brands of bottled water available in the country contain pesticides significantly higher than permissible limits .
the cse report said that , in some cases , the bottled water contained banned chemicals .
it said risks to health included serious physical impairment ranging from damage to the central nervous system to lung cancer .
the government responded by saying it was in the process of tightening safety standards for both soft drinks and bottled water and new guidelines for the purpose would be issued by january next year .
' more credible ' but now , in the controversy over pepsi and coca-cola , the cse and the indian government find themselves at odds .
health minister sushma swaraj , however , did not appear to want to blow up the differences between the two sides .
while she said the cse report was exaggerated , she thanked it for " highlighting the problem that needed attention " .
and she told parliament that with " increasing use of pesticides , the groundwater and other water sources are likely to be more contaminated and therefore stricter norms need to be in place " .
other environmental groups dispute the government view that the cse findings were exaggerated .
" the cse is definitely more credible than the government run-labs .
this country is in a mess as far as quality standards are concerned , " devinder sharma , an expert on food security told the bbc .
" the latest controversy has thrown up one very important issue about the gaps in corporate responsibility . "
further support for cse came from vipin matthew benjamin , a lawyer with the pressure group , environmental justice initiative .
" the cse has one of the most well-equipped labs to carry out such tests , " he said .
campaigners also argue that the big issue in this controversy is not the accuracy of the cse report into pepsi and coca cola .
they say the dispute shows that the institutional mechanisms to test quality standards in india are conspicuous by their absence .
hence pressure groups such as cse have to play a crucial role in compelling the policy makers to think about such issues .
" the problem of food adulteration should be pointed out by the ministry of health .
but in india it is left to the environment groups alone , " says ravi aggarwal of delhi-based environmental group toxic links .
" i think the environmental as well as consumer groups must come together to push for the larger systemic issues and ensure that food safety mechanism is in place . "
environmental groups complain of a general laxity with regard to food quality standards in india .
they says a vigorous campaign is needed to sensitise the government over the issue .

the indian government now says tests it has authorised show that the drinks are safe and the cse 's findings were wrong .
many are clearly not worried by the cse 's report the cse has been operating in india for more than 20 years .
it is a non-government organisation that describes its goal as the promotion of environmentally sound and equitable development strategies .
the cse has run two successful campaigns in india in recent years .
its efforts in the 1990s forced the government in the capital , delhi , to adopt environmentally-friendly fuel compressed natural gas -lrb- cng -rrb- in the city buses to reduce pollution .
this year , a study conducted by the group revealed that most of the brands of bottled water available in the country contain pesticides significantly higher than permissible limits .
the cse report said that , in some cases , the bottled water contained banned chemicals .
it said risks to health included serious physical impairment ranging from damage to the central nervous system to lung cancer .
the government responded by saying it was in the process of tightening safety standards for both soft drinks and bottled water and new guidelines for the purpose would be issued by january next year .
' more credible ' but now , in the controversy over pepsi and coca-cola , the cse and the indian government find themselves at odds .
a cse campaign forced delhi buses to reduce pollution health minister sushma swaraj , however , did not appear to want to blow up the differences between the two sides .
while she said the cse report was exaggerated , she thanked it for " highlighting the problem that needed attention " .
and she told parliament that with " increasing use of pesticides , the groundwater and other water sources are likely to be more contaminated and therefore stricter norms need to be in place " .
other environmental groups dispute the government view that the cse findings were exaggerated .
" the cse is definitely more credible than the government run-labs .
this country is in a mess as far as quality standards are concerned , " devinder sharma , an expert on food security told the bbc .
" the latest controversy has thrown up one very important issue about the gaps in corporate responsibility . "
further support for cse came from vipin matthew benjamin , a lawyer with the pressure group , environmental justice initiative .
" the cse has one of the most well-equipped labs to carry out such tests , " he said .
campaigners also argue that the big issue in this controversy is not the accuracy of the cse report into pepsi and coca cola .
they say the dispute shows that the institutional mechanisms to test quality standards in india are conspicuous by their absence .
hence pressure groups such as cse have to play a crucial role in compelling the policy makers to think about such issues .
" the problem of food adulteration should be pointed out by the ministry of health .
but in india it is left to the environment groups alone , " says ravi aggarwal of delhi-based environmental group toxic links .
" i think the environmental as well as consumer groups must come together to push for the larger systemic issues and ensure that food safety mechanism is in place . "
environmental groups complain of a general laxity with regard to food quality standards in india .
they says a vigorous campaign is needed to sensitise the government over the issue .

your e-mails have been pouring into the going loco nerve centre , many asking what happens in places like india , where heat is a constant factor .
the answer is that grotesquely overcrowded trains with no creature comforts crawl along , stopping for hours on end with no explanation .
in fact , not much different from us .
as one user rightly pointed out , rail buckling does occur , and it 's better to slow down than be derailed .
sometimes though , there 's just no second-guessing the sort of excuses passengers are subjected to .
such as this : i was late for college on several occasions , thanks to dear old south west trains and each of the following : swans on the line , a bull on the line , horses on the line and sniffer dogs on the track .
not all at once , i hasten to add .
and i should explain that my route went through the new forest and over the estuary at totton .
deborah metters if it 's not animals , it 's insects !
yes , believe it or not , even a tiny invertebrate can wreak havoc .
i was held up for about 40 minutes on the inter city from london - eventually the driver announced that the delay was because they were washing dead insects off the windscreen .
i rather got the impression from his tone of voice that he was pleased to be adding yet another excuse to the railway 's long list .
simon it 's a bug 's life , this commuting .
also in the good excuses category , from some years back ...
we are sorry to announce the cancellation of the 0723 to leeds this is due to a excess of weeds in the track .
j perkin -lrb- ex-br -rrb- i 'm very grateful to the contributor of this : one day at crewe , the announcer was calmly saying " all trains running south are delayed due to , err ... " and then somebody else -lrb- presumably a signalman , not realising exactly how sensitive the microphone was -rrb- shouted out " because another * * * * ' ing freight train has broken down " .
the announcer then continued calmly " due to a failed freight train on the mainline " .
it made everyone on the platform chuckle and realise in fact there are often genuine issues behind the apologies .
chris huntingford refreshingly down-to-earth language was also heard by paul , who explains the announcement ...
" we apologise for the delay .
this is due to a bloody cock-up . "
everybody simply looked at each other and accepted it as probably the best and most honest explanation of the rail system !
paul i get many responses from abroad , and here 's one from melbourne , australia , where they know a thing or two about warm weather .
with regard to the current stories on the web page - out here trains really do get stopped when the rails get too hot .
with air temperatures at or near 50c in summer heat buckling is a real problem .
partial solution ?
they paint the rails white to reflect the heat !
rick squirrell those canny ozzies .
meanwhile , a -lrb- smug -rrb- expat writes : as i now live in switzerland , i can only marvel at how the british commuter can tolerate journeys to work on a system as bad as that which i endured between 1987 and 1997 .
to have days of travel with no light nor heat , at a snail 's pace , because of a bit of snow , is laughable .
with leaves on the line , cows on the line -lrb- yes , chelmsford , 1988 -rrb- and , once , a dumper truck -lrb- that fell from the building site at liverpool street -rrb- , i am grateful to br and its successors for the humour it inadvertently brought to my life at the time .
chris bunting back to animal behaviour .
where do i begin ?
over the years , i 've had the rain , the wind , the snow and just about everything else nature has to offer , given as an excuse .
one of the most bizarre was a late running clapham junction to basingstoke service that was delayed due to hamsters .
they 'd escaped from a box in the luggage car .
andy i once boarded an early morning connex commuter train from honor oak park to london cannon st which came to a halt 30 seconds after leaving the station .
after a wait of over half an hour , we were told that the delay was due to a dead badger on the track !
lee yeomans i 'll leave you with this real shocker .
i apologise if you find it upsetting , but sometimes it 's best to confront these things head on .
once , many moons ago .
my train was on time , the train was clean and tidy , the staff where courteous and we arrived at our destination without any delay .
it was so long ago that sometimes seems like a dream !

your e-mails have been pouring into the going loco nerve centre , many asking what happens in places like india , where heat is a constant factor .
the answer is that grotesquely overcrowded trains with no creature comforts crawl along , stopping for hours on end with no explanation .
in fact , not much different from us .
as one user rightly pointed out , rail buckling does occur , and it 's better to slow down than be derailed .
sometimes though , there 's just no second-guessing the sort of excuses passengers are subjected to .
such as this : i was late for college on several occasions , thanks to dear old south west trains and each of the following : swans on the line , a bull on the line , horses on the line and sniffer dogs on the track .
not all at once , i hasten to add .
and i should explain that my route went through the new forest and over the estuary at totton .
deborah metters if it 's not animals , it 's insects !
yes , believe it or not , even a tiny invertebrate can wreak havoc .
i was held up for about 40 minutes on the inter city from london - eventually the driver announced that the delay was because they were washing dead insects off the windscreen .
i rather got the impression from his tone of voice that he was pleased to be adding yet another excuse to the railway 's long list .
simon it 's a bug 's life , this commuting .
also in the good excuses category , from some years back ...
we are sorry to announce the cancellation of the 0723 to leeds this is due to a excess of weeds in the track .
j perkin -lrb- ex-br -rrb- i 'm very grateful to the contributor of this : one day at crewe , the announcer was calmly saying " all trains running south are delayed due to , err ... " and then somebody else -lrb- presumably a signalman , not realising exactly how sensitive the microphone was -rrb- shouted out " because another * * * * ' ing freight train has broken down " .
the announcer then continued calmly " due to a failed freight train on the mainline " .
it made everyone on the platform chuckle and realise in fact there are often genuine issues behind the apologies .
chris huntingford refreshingly down-to-earth language was also heard by paul , who explains the announcement ...
" we apologise for the delay .
this is due to a bloody cock-up . "
everybody simply looked at each other and accepted it as probably the best and most honest explanation of the rail system !
paul i get many responses from abroad , and here 's one from melbourne , australia , where they know a thing or two about warm weather .
with regard to the current stories on the web page - out here trains really do get stopped when the rails get too hot .
with air temperatures at or near 50c in summer heat buckling is a real problem .
partial solution ?
they paint the rails white to reflect the heat !
rick squirrell those canny ozzies .
meanwhile , a -lrb- smug -rrb- expat writes : as i now live in switzerland , i can only marvel at how the british commuter can tolerate journeys to work on a system as bad as that which i endured between 1987 and 1997 .
to have days of travel with no light nor heat , at a snail 's pace , because of a bit of snow , is laughable .
with leaves on the line , cows on the line -lrb- yes , chelmsford , 1988 -rrb- and , once , a dumper truck -lrb- that fell from the building site at liverpool street -rrb- , i am grateful to br and its successors for the humour it inadvertently brought to my life at the time .
chris bunting back to animal behaviour .
where do i begin ?
over the years , i 've had the rain , the wind , the snow and just about everything else nature has to offer , given as an excuse .
one of the most bizarre was a late running clapham junction to basingstoke service that was delayed due to hamsters .
they 'd escaped from a box in the luggage car .
andy i once boarded an early morning connex commuter train from honor oak park to london cannon st which came to a halt 30 seconds after leaving the station .
after a wait of over half an hour , we were told that the delay was due to a dead badger on the track !
lee yeomans i 'll leave you with this real shocker .
i apologise if you find it upsetting , but sometimes it 's best to confront these things head on .
once , many moons ago .
my train was on time , the train was clean and tidy , the staff where courteous and we arrived at our destination without any delay .
it was so long ago that sometimes seems like a dream !
martyn haynes after that , i need to lay down in a cool dark room .
