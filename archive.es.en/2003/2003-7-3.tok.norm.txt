with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .
he thanked the parties for working on planned reforms to the public health care system while admonishing them not to reject the current reforms and tax cuts , saying such a move " would not pay off . " trouble for the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and angela merkel schröder 's policies are extremely similar to those being proposed by the conservative union bloc , which has put politicians like the cdu 's angela merkel -lrb- photo right -rrb- and the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- photo left -rrb- on the defensive in recent weeks . schröder has effectively taken the wind out of their sails by adopting the union 's earlier calls for the tax cut to be pushed ahead .
in recent days , there has been considerable fighting between the cdu and csu over whether to support schröder 's tax reform plan or to block it – an embarrassing spat for the opposition , which has long championed exactly the kinds of cuts the government is seeking to push through . the conservatives are now faced with a difficult decision : block schröder 's reforms and hope he his blamed for the failure , or support the reforms and allow the chancellor to take credit for ideas they long ago pitched on their own . the depth of this crisis was apparent in the rebuttal given by cdu chairwoman angela merkel , who attacked schröder for changing the tack of government : " what is the direction of your policies ? " she asked .
" you have to at least know on a quarterly basis . "
but , in the end , she essentially supported schröder 's calls for tax cuts and structural reforms and was only able to complain that the government had failed to deliver a convincing plan for how to finance the cuts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .

long famous for its markets , tangier is now home to a camp that illustrates a darker side of trade : human trafficking .
it 's a station for sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in europe .
but many never make it . tangier , morocco - " i think about god .
i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .
if the neighbor earns 200,000 francs , then i have to earn more .
and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be immigrants are helped by spanish soldiers on the punta paloma beach in tarifa , spain , on may 8 , 2003 .
some 50 immigrants survived the crossing arriving in a small boat from morocco .
spain is encountering a similar surge in illegal immigration .
the government detained 23,381 people trying to enter the continent from morocco in 2002 .
and the spanish interior ministry reported in 2002 that it had busted 735 human trafficking rings , up from 362 the year before .
the moroccan workers ' and immigrants ' association in spain -lrb- atime -rrb- has estimated that 4,000 people have died since 1997 crossing the strait of gibraltar or the slip of ocean separating africa from spain ’ s canary islands .
governments across europe are seeking to take action , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the rotating president of the european union , has said he will make combating illegal immigration a priority during his six months at the helm .
berlusconi has called for the creation of a european border patrol agency to scan the waters for illegal immigrants as well as the establishment of detainment centers outside the eu for illegal immigrants .
in the mean time , the immigrants keep coming and the dangers continue to grow .
shuffling from border to border more than 100 people are gathered in a temporary tent made of cellophane here in tangier .
as long as they have a little pocket money on them , the police continue to look the other way .
some women are so desperate to stay here that they 're willing to sell their bodies to raise the necessary cash .
occasionally there are police raids and some of the refugees are taken back to the algerian border .
but they just hop on the next bus back to tangier .
just as the police in tangier are happy to look the other way , so are the border guards in algeria .
some refugees have been traveling back and forth between the two countries for six months .
" i went through algeria until i could get over here ... the hard way , " says a man named oscar .
" i had to travel across the desert to get to morocco .
normally the trip takes eight months , but if you have enough money you can do it in five months .
i was really lucky to have made it this far . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish civil guard has its hands full trying to intercept rickety boats bound for its coasts from north africa .
the illegal immigrants in tangier are in a quandary .
the spanish government recently erected a $ 120 million radar system along the coast that serves as an electronic fence between the spanish port city of algeciras and tangier .
since then , it 's become much more difficult for refugee boats to get across to the european continent .
some now try to make it as far as the canary islands .
others try to make it to libya , where many boats are now heading for italy .
but to do so , they must first cross algeria – a large , dangerous and , for the immigrants , expensive land .
others opt to stay here in the make-shift camp and continue dreaming of el dorado .
stanley is among them .
" we 're trying to get out of here together , " says stanley .
" and one day we 'll make it to europe .

the moroccan workers ' and immigrants ' association in spain -lrb- atime -rrb- has estimated that 4,000 people have died since 1997 crossing the strait of gibraltar or the slip of ocean separating africa from spain ’ s canary islands .
governments across europe are seeking to take action , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the rotating president of the european union , has said he will make combating illegal immigration a priority during his six months at the helm .
berlusconi has called for the creation of a european border patrol agency to scan the waters for illegal immigrants as well as the establishment of detainment centers outside the eu for illegal immigrants .
in the mean time , the immigrants keep coming and the dangers continue to grow .
shuffling from border to border more than 100 people are gathered in a temporary tent made of cellophane here in tangier .
as long as they have a little pocket money on them , the police continue to look the other way .
some women are so desperate to stay here that they 're willing to sell their bodies to raise the necessary cash .
occasionally there are police raids and some of the refugees are taken back to the algerian border .
but they just hop on the next bus back to tangier .
just as the police in tangier are happy to look the other way , so are the border guards in algeria .
some refugees have been traveling back and forth between the two countries for six months .
" i went through algeria until i could get over here ... the hard way , " says a man named oscar .
" i had to travel across the desert to get to morocco .
normally the trip takes eight months , but if you have enough money you can do it in five months .
i was really lucky to have made it this far . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish civil guard has its hands full trying to intercept rickety boats bound for its coasts from north africa .
the illegal immigrants in tangier are in a quandary .
the spanish government recently erected a $ 120 million radar system along the coast that serves as an electronic fence between the spanish port city of algeciras and tangier .
since then , it 's become much more difficult for refugee boats to get across to the european continent .
some now try to make it as far as the canary islands .
others try to make it to libya , where many boats are now heading for italy .
but to do so , they must first cross algeria – a large , dangerous and , for the immigrants , expensive land .
others opt to stay here in the make-shift camp and continue dreaming of el dorado .

long famous for its markets , tangier is now home to a camp that illustrates a darker side of trade : human trafficking .
it 's a station for sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in europe .
but many never make it . tangier , morocco - " i think about god .
i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .
if the neighbor earns 200,000 francs , then i have to earn more .
and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .

i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .
if the neighbor earns 200,000 francs , then i have to earn more .
and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be immigrants are helped by spanish soldiers on the punta paloma beach in tarifa , spain , on may 8 , 2003 .
some 50 immigrants survived the crossing arriving in a small boat from morocco .
spain is encountering a similar surge in illegal immigration .
the government detained 23,381 people trying to enter the continent from morocco in 2002 .
and the spanish interior ministry reported in 2002 that it had busted 735 human trafficking rings , up from 362 the year before .
the moroccan workers ' and immigrants ' association in spain -lrb- atime -rrb- has estimated that 4,000 people have died since 1997 crossing the strait of gibraltar or the slip of ocean separating africa from spain ’ s canary islands .
governments across europe are seeking to take action , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the rotating president of the european union , has said he will make combating illegal immigration a priority during his six months at the helm .
berlusconi has called for the creation of a european border patrol agency to scan the waters for illegal immigrants as well as the establishment of detainment centers outside the eu for illegal immigrants .
in the mean time , the immigrants keep coming and the dangers continue to grow .
shuffling from border to border more than 100 people are gathered in a temporary tent made of cellophane here in tangier .
as long as they have a little pocket money on them , the police continue to look the other way .
some women are so desperate to stay here that they 're willing to sell their bodies to raise the necessary cash .
occasionally there are police raids and some of the refugees are taken back to the algerian border .
but they just hop on the next bus back to tangier .
just as the police in tangier are happy to look the other way , so are the border guards in algeria .
some refugees have been traveling back and forth between the two countries for six months .
" i went through algeria until i could get over here ... the hard way , " says a man named oscar .
" i had to travel across the desert to get to morocco .
normally the trip takes eight months , but if you have enough money you can do it in five months .
i was really lucky to have made it this far . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish civil guard has its hands full trying to intercept rickety boats bound for its coasts from north africa .
the illegal immigrants in tangier are in a quandary .
the spanish government recently erected a $ 120 million radar system along the coast that serves as an electronic fence between the spanish port city of algeciras and tangier .
since then , it 's become much more difficult for refugee boats to get across to the european continent .
some now try to make it as far as the canary islands .
others try to make it to libya , where many boats are now heading for italy .
but to do so , they must first cross algeria – a large , dangerous and , for the immigrants , expensive land .
others opt to stay here in the make-shift camp and continue dreaming of el dorado .
stanley is among them .
" we 're trying to get out of here together , " says stanley .
" and one day we 'll make it to europe .
i have faith .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .
he thanked the parties for working on planned reforms to the public health care system while admonishing them not to reject the current reforms and tax cuts , saying such a move " would not pay off . " trouble for the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and angela merkel schröder 's policies are extremely similar to those being proposed by the conservative union bloc , which has put politicians like the cdu 's angela merkel -lrb- photo right -rrb- and the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- photo left -rrb- on the defensive in recent weeks . schröder has effectively taken the wind out of their sails by adopting the union 's earlier calls for the tax cut to be pushed ahead .
in recent days , there has been considerable fighting between the cdu and csu over whether to support schröder 's tax reform plan or to block it – an embarrassing spat for the opposition , which has long championed exactly the kinds of cuts the government is seeking to push through . the conservatives are now faced with a difficult decision : block schröder 's reforms and hope he his blamed for the failure , or support the reforms and allow the chancellor to take credit for ideas they long ago pitched on their own . the depth of this crisis was apparent in the rebuttal given by cdu chairwoman angela merkel , who attacked schröder for changing the tack of government : " what is the direction of your policies ?

" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder announced at a brief news conference following a telephone conversation with berlusconi earlier in the day . schröder had demanded a full apology from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt to a german member of the european parliament made in the european parliament on wednesday . schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed mep martin schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content " .
to applause from the german parliament , schröder said he expected berlusconi to " apologize fully for this unacceptable comparison " . outrage at home and abroad berlusconi caused an uproar in the european parliament on wednesday when he made the remarks following comments by schulz , who had repeatedly criticized the italian prime minister for his use of an immunity law to sidestep bribery charges in a milan court . the incident triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries . schröder 's office immediately summoned the italian ambassador to berlin and the italian foreign ministry responded by summoning the german envoy to condemn the comments made by schulz , saying he had made an " unacceptable offence " to berlusconi . in addition , the issue has fuelled widely-held concerns over berlusconi 's ability to provide eu leadership at a time when the union faces unprecedented challenges , including the securing of an agreement over the draft european constitution and the healing of the transatlantic rift .
italy took up the rotating eu presidency on july 1 . raw feelings schröder said on thursday that he hoped italy 's eu presidency would get back on track and that any further steps that might be taken over the affair were now the responsibility of the european parliament . " i expressed my hope that everybody must concentrate on making sure that europe moves forward with its business , " he said . however , the dispute is far from over and feelings are still raw .
" given the major sensitivities involved it would have been better for berlusconi to withdraw the remark immediately , " the dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende told dutch news agency anp .
" it is a sensitive issue and could hurt people . "
the luxembourg government said prime minister jean-claude juncker was " shocked " by what it described as berlusconi 's unacceptable comments . and at a meeting in strasbourg , tensions rose as european parliament leaders failed to agree at an emergency meeting to demand that berlusconi make amends . still highly sensitive topic germany is still highly sensitive about its nazi past . last year , a remark made by the then justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing president bush 's policies on iraq to methods adopted by adolf hitler sparked outrage both at home and abroad , leading to the further souring of relations between the united states and germany . also last year , a remark made by former conservative chancellor helmut kohl for likening the social democrat speaker of german parliament to the president of the nazi-dominated reichstag , hermann goering , sparked a public dispute with schröder demanding an apology . and roland koch , hardline conservative premier of the german state hesse , caused outrage when , during a debate on federal government plans to introduce a wealth tax , he said that rich people were being singled out as if they had a " new form of a star on their chest " , referring to the jew 's suffering under hitler . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliamentarians give berlusconi an " f " in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .

" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder announced at a brief news conference following a telephone conversation with berlusconi earlier in the day . schröder had demanded a full apology from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt to a german member of the european parliament made in the european parliament on wednesday . schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed mep martin schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content " .
to applause from the german parliament , schröder said he expected berlusconi to " apologize fully for this unacceptable comparison " . outrage at home and abroad berlusconi caused an uproar in the european parliament on wednesday when he made the remarks following comments by schulz , who had repeatedly criticized the italian prime minister for his use of an immunity law to sidestep bribery charges in a milan court . the incident triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries . schröder 's office immediately summoned the italian ambassador to berlin and the italian foreign ministry responded by summoning the german envoy to condemn the comments made by schulz , saying he had made an " unacceptable offence " to berlusconi . in addition , the issue has fuelled widely-held concerns over berlusconi 's ability to provide eu leadership at a time when the union faces unprecedented challenges , including the securing of an agreement over the draft european constitution and the healing of the transatlantic rift .
italy took up the rotating eu presidency on july 1 . raw feelings schröder said on thursday that he hoped italy 's eu presidency would get back on track and that any further steps that might be taken over the affair were now the responsibility of the european parliament . " i expressed my hope that everybody must concentrate on making sure that europe moves forward with its business , " he said . however , the dispute is far from over and feelings are still raw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2003 eu parliament approves emissions trading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto treaty needs to be ratified by countries responsible for at least 55 percent of the world 's carbon emissions .
the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .

" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder announced at a brief news conference following a telephone conversation with berlusconi earlier in the day . schröder had demanded a full apology from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt to a german member of the european parliament made in the european parliament on wednesday . schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed mep martin schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content " .
to applause from the german parliament , schröder said he expected berlusconi to " apologize fully for this unacceptable comparison " . outrage at home and abroad berlusconi caused an uproar in the european parliament on wednesday when he made the remarks following comments by schulz , who had repeatedly criticized the italian prime minister for his use of an immunity law to sidestep bribery charges in a milan court . the incident triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries . schröder 's office immediately summoned the italian ambassador to berlin and the italian foreign ministry responded by summoning the german envoy to condemn the comments made by schulz , saying he had made an " unacceptable offence " to berlusconi . in addition , the issue has fuelled widely-held concerns over berlusconi 's ability to provide eu leadership at a time when the union faces unprecedented challenges , including the securing of an agreement over the draft european constitution and the healing of the transatlantic rift .
italy took up the rotating eu presidency on july 1 . raw feelings schröder said on thursday that he hoped italy 's eu presidency would get back on track and that any further steps that might be taken over the affair were now the responsibility of the european parliament . " i expressed my hope that everybody must concentrate on making sure that europe moves forward with its business , " he said . however , the dispute is far from over and feelings are still raw .
" given the major sensitivities involved it would have been better for berlusconi to withdraw the remark immediately , " the dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende told dutch news agency anp .
" it is a sensitive issue and could hurt people . "
the luxembourg government said prime minister jean-claude juncker was " shocked " by what it described as berlusconi 's unacceptable comments . and at a meeting in strasbourg , tensions rose as european parliament leaders failed to agree at an emergency meeting to demand that berlusconi make amends . still highly sensitive topic germany is still highly sensitive about its nazi past . last year , a remark made by the then justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing president bush 's policies on iraq to methods adopted by adolf hitler sparked outrage both at home and abroad , leading to the further souring of relations between the united states and germany . also last year , a remark made by former conservative chancellor helmut kohl for likening the social democrat speaker of german parliament to the president of the nazi-dominated reichstag , hermann goering , sparked a public dispute with schröder demanding an apology . and roland koch , hardline conservative premier of the german state hesse , caused outrage when , during a debate on federal government plans to introduce a wealth tax , he said that rich people were being singled out as if they had a " new form of a star on their chest " , referring to the jew 's suffering under hitler . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliamentarians give berlusconi an " f " in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .

long famous for its markets , tangier is now home to a camp that illustrates a darker side of trade : human trafficking .
it 's a station for sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in europe .
but many never make it . tangier , morocco - " i think about god .
i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .
if the neighbor earns 200,000 francs , then i have to earn more .
and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be immigrants are helped by spanish soldiers on the punta paloma beach in tarifa , spain , on may 8 , 2003 .
some 50 immigrants survived the crossing arriving in a small boat from morocco .
spain is encountering a similar surge in illegal immigration .
the government detained 23,381 people trying to enter the continent from morocco in 2002 .

" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .
he thanked the parties for working on planned reforms to the public health care system while admonishing them not to reject the current reforms and tax cuts , saying such a move " would not pay off . " trouble for the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and angela merkel schröder 's policies are extremely similar to those being proposed by the conservative union bloc , which has put politicians like the cdu 's angela merkel -lrb- photo right -rrb- and the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- photo left -rrb- on the defensive in recent weeks . schröder has effectively taken the wind out of their sails by adopting the union 's earlier calls for the tax cut to be pushed ahead .
in recent days , there has been considerable fighting between the cdu and csu over whether to support schröder 's tax reform plan or to block it – an embarrassing spat for the opposition , which has long championed exactly the kinds of cuts the government is seeking to push through . the conservatives are now faced with a difficult decision : block schröder 's reforms and hope he his blamed for the failure , or support the reforms and allow the chancellor to take credit for ideas they long ago pitched on their own . the depth of this crisis was apparent in the rebuttal given by cdu chairwoman angela merkel , who attacked schröder for changing the tack of government : " what is the direction of your policies ? " she asked .
" you have to at least know on a quarterly basis . "
but , in the end , she essentially supported schröder 's calls for tax cuts and structural reforms and was only able to complain that the government had failed to deliver a convincing plan for how to finance the cuts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2003 eu parliament approves emissions trading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto treaty needs to be ratified by countries responsible for at least 55 percent of the world 's carbon emissions .
the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2003 schröder pushes opposition onto defensive over reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder : co-opting a few ideas from the opposition .
with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .
he thanked the parties for working on planned reforms to the public health care system while admonishing them not to reject the current reforms and tax cuts , saying such a move " would not pay off . " trouble for the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and angela merkel schröder 's policies are extremely similar to those being proposed by the conservative union bloc , which has put politicians like the cdu 's angela merkel -lrb- photo right -rrb- and the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- photo left -rrb- on the defensive in recent weeks . schröder has effectively taken the wind out of their sails by adopting the union 's earlier calls for the tax cut to be pushed ahead .
in recent days , there has been considerable fighting between the cdu and csu over whether to support schröder 's tax reform plan or to block it – an embarrassing spat for the opposition , which has long championed exactly the kinds of cuts the government is seeking to push through . the conservatives are now faced with a difficult decision : block schröder 's reforms and hope he his blamed for the failure , or support the reforms and allow the chancellor to take credit for ideas they long ago pitched on their own . the depth of this crisis was apparent in the rebuttal given by cdu chairwoman angela merkel , who attacked schröder for changing the tack of government : " what is the direction of your policies ? " she asked .
" you have to at least know on a quarterly basis . "
but , in the end , she essentially supported schröder 's calls for tax cuts and structural reforms and was only able to complain that the government had failed to deliver a convincing plan for how to finance the cuts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

long famous for its markets , tangier is now home to a camp that illustrates a darker side of trade : human trafficking .
it 's a station for sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in europe .
but many never make it . tangier , morocco - " i think about god .
i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .
if the neighbor earns 200,000 francs , then i have to earn more .
and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be immigrants are helped by spanish soldiers on the punta paloma beach in tarifa , spain , on may 8 , 2003 .
some 50 immigrants survived the crossing arriving in a small boat from morocco .
spain is encountering a similar surge in illegal immigration .
the government detained 23,381 people trying to enter the continent from morocco in 2002 .
and the spanish interior ministry reported in 2002 that it had busted 735 human trafficking rings , up from 362 the year before .
the moroccan workers ' and immigrants ' association in spain -lrb- atime -rrb- has estimated that 4,000 people have died since 1997 crossing the strait of gibraltar or the slip of ocean separating africa from spain ’ s canary islands .
governments across europe are seeking to take action , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the rotating president of the european union , has said he will make combating illegal immigration a priority during his six months at the helm .
berlusconi has called for the creation of a european border patrol agency to scan the waters for illegal immigrants as well as the establishment of detainment centers outside the eu for illegal immigrants .
in the mean time , the immigrants keep coming and the dangers continue to grow .
shuffling from border to border more than 100 people are gathered in a temporary tent made of cellophane here in tangier .
as long as they have a little pocket money on them , the police continue to look the other way .
some women are so desperate to stay here that they 're willing to sell their bodies to raise the necessary cash .
occasionally there are police raids and some of the refugees are taken back to the algerian border .
but they just hop on the next bus back to tangier .
just as the police in tangier are happy to look the other way , so are the border guards in algeria .
some refugees have been traveling back and forth between the two countries for six months .
" i went through algeria until i could get over here ... the hard way , " says a man named oscar .
" i had to travel across the desert to get to morocco .
normally the trip takes eight months , but if you have enough money you can do it in five months .
i was really lucky to have made it this far . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish civil guard has its hands full trying to intercept rickety boats bound for its coasts from north africa .
the illegal immigrants in tangier are in a quandary .
the spanish government recently erected a $ 120 million radar system along the coast that serves as an electronic fence between the spanish port city of algeciras and tangier .
since then , it 's become much more difficult for refugee boats to get across to the european continent .
some now try to make it as far as the canary islands .
others try to make it to libya , where many boats are now heading for italy .
but to do so , they must first cross algeria – a large , dangerous and , for the immigrants , expensive land .
others opt to stay here in the make-shift camp and continue dreaming of el dorado .
stanley is among them .
" we 're trying to get out of here together , " says stanley .
" and one day we 'll make it to europe .
i have faith . " daniella baumeister send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wave of immigrants laps at italy 's door as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean .

" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder announced at a brief news conference following a telephone conversation with berlusconi earlier in the day . schröder had demanded a full apology from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt to a german member of the european parliament made in the european parliament on wednesday . schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed mep martin schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content " .

" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder announced at a brief news conference following a telephone conversation with berlusconi earlier in the day . schröder had demanded a full apology from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt to a german member of the european parliament made in the european parliament on wednesday . schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed mep martin schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content " .
to applause from the german parliament , schröder said he expected berlusconi to " apologize fully for this unacceptable comparison " . outrage at home and abroad berlusconi caused an uproar in the european parliament on wednesday when he made the remarks following comments by schulz , who had repeatedly criticized the italian prime minister for his use of an immunity law to sidestep bribery charges in a milan court . the incident triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries . schröder 's office immediately summoned the italian ambassador to berlin and the italian foreign ministry responded by summoning the german envoy to condemn the comments made by schulz , saying he had made an " unacceptable offence " to berlusconi . in addition , the issue has fuelled widely-held concerns over berlusconi 's ability to provide eu leadership at a time when the union faces unprecedented challenges , including the securing of an agreement over the draft european constitution and the healing of the transatlantic rift .

" i expressed my hope that everybody must concentrate on making sure that europe moves forward with its business , " he said . however , the dispute is far from over and feelings are still raw .

" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder announced at a brief news conference following a telephone conversation with berlusconi earlier in the day . schröder had demanded a full apology from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt to a german member of the european parliament made in the european parliament on wednesday . schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed mep martin schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content " .
to applause from the german parliament , schröder said he expected berlusconi to " apologize fully for this unacceptable comparison " . outrage at home and abroad berlusconi caused an uproar in the european parliament on wednesday when he made the remarks following comments by schulz , who had repeatedly criticized the italian prime minister for his use of an immunity law to sidestep bribery charges in a milan court . the incident triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries . schröder 's office immediately summoned the italian ambassador to berlin and the italian foreign ministry responded by summoning the german envoy to condemn the comments made by schulz , saying he had made an " unacceptable offence " to berlusconi . in addition , the issue has fuelled widely-held concerns over berlusconi 's ability to provide eu leadership at a time when the union faces unprecedented challenges , including the securing of an agreement over the draft european constitution and the healing of the transatlantic rift .
italy took up the rotating eu presidency on july 1 . raw feelings schröder said on thursday that he hoped italy 's eu presidency would get back on track and that any further steps that might be taken over the affair were now the responsibility of the european parliament . " i expressed my hope that everybody must concentrate on making sure that europe moves forward with its business , " he said . however , the dispute is far from over and feelings are still raw .
" given the major sensitivities involved it would have been better for berlusconi to withdraw the remark immediately , " the dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende told dutch news agency anp .
" it is a sensitive issue and could hurt people . "
the luxembourg government said prime minister jean-claude juncker was " shocked " by what it described as berlusconi 's unacceptable comments . and at a meeting in strasbourg , tensions rose as european parliament leaders failed to agree at an emergency meeting to demand that berlusconi make amends . still highly sensitive topic germany is still highly sensitive about its nazi past . last year , a remark made by the then justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing president bush 's policies on iraq to methods adopted by adolf hitler sparked outrage both at home and abroad , leading to the further souring of relations between the united states and germany . also last year , a remark made by former conservative chancellor helmut kohl for likening the social democrat speaker of german parliament to the president of the nazi-dominated reichstag , hermann goering , sparked a public dispute with schröder demanding an apology . and roland koch , hardline conservative premier of the german state hesse , caused outrage when , during a debate on federal government plans to introduce a wealth tax , he said that rich people were being singled out as if they had a " new form of a star on their chest " , referring to the jew 's suffering under hitler . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliamentarians give berlusconi an " f " in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .
he thanked the parties for working on planned reforms to the public health care system while admonishing them not to reject the current reforms and tax cuts , saying such a move " would not pay off . " trouble for the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and angela merkel schröder 's policies are extremely similar to those being proposed by the conservative union bloc , which has put politicians like the cdu 's angela merkel -lrb- photo right -rrb- and the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- photo left -rrb- on the defensive in recent weeks . schröder has effectively taken the wind out of their sails by adopting the union 's earlier calls for the tax cut to be pushed ahead .
in recent days , there has been considerable fighting between the cdu and csu over whether to support schröder 's tax reform plan or to block it – an embarrassing spat for the opposition , which has long championed exactly the kinds of cuts the government is seeking to push through . the conservatives are now faced with a difficult decision : block schröder 's reforms and hope he his blamed for the failure , or support the reforms and allow the chancellor to take credit for ideas they long ago pitched on their own . the depth of this crisis was apparent in the rebuttal given by cdu chairwoman angela merkel , who attacked schröder for changing the tack of government : " what is the direction of your policies ? " she asked .

additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .

" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2003 eu parliament approves emissions trading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto treaty needs to be ratified by countries responsible for at least 55 percent of the world 's carbon emissions .
the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .

and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be immigrants are helped by spanish soldiers on the punta paloma beach in tarifa , spain , on may 8 , 2003 .
some 50 immigrants survived the crossing arriving in a small boat from morocco .
spain is encountering a similar surge in illegal immigration .
the government detained 23,381 people trying to enter the continent from morocco in 2002 .
and the spanish interior ministry reported in 2002 that it had busted 735 human trafficking rings , up from 362 the year before .
the moroccan workers ' and immigrants ' association in spain -lrb- atime -rrb- has estimated that 4,000 people have died since 1997 crossing the strait of gibraltar or the slip of ocean separating africa from spain ’ s canary islands .
governments across europe are seeking to take action , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the rotating president of the european union , has said he will make combating illegal immigration a priority during his six months at the helm .
berlusconi has called for the creation of a european border patrol agency to scan the waters for illegal immigrants as well as the establishment of detainment centers outside the eu for illegal immigrants .
in the mean time , the immigrants keep coming and the dangers continue to grow .
shuffling from border to border more than 100 people are gathered in a temporary tent made of cellophane here in tangier .
as long as they have a little pocket money on them , the police continue to look the other way .
some women are so desperate to stay here that they 're willing to sell their bodies to raise the necessary cash .
occasionally there are police raids and some of the refugees are taken back to the algerian border .
but they just hop on the next bus back to tangier .
just as the police in tangier are happy to look the other way , so are the border guards in algeria .
some refugees have been traveling back and forth between the two countries for six months .
" i went through algeria until i could get over here ... the hard way , " says a man named oscar .
" i had to travel across the desert to get to morocco .
normally the trip takes eight months , but if you have enough money you can do it in five months .
i was really lucky to have made it this far . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish civil guard has its hands full trying to intercept rickety boats bound for its coasts from north africa .
the illegal immigrants in tangier are in a quandary .
the spanish government recently erected a $ 120 million radar system along the coast that serves as an electronic fence between the spanish port city of algeciras and tangier .
since then , it 's become much more difficult for refugee boats to get across to the european continent .
some now try to make it as far as the canary islands .
others try to make it to libya , where many boats are now heading for italy .
but to do so , they must first cross algeria – a large , dangerous and , for the immigrants , expensive land .
others opt to stay here in the make-shift camp and continue dreaming of el dorado .
stanley is among them .
" we 're trying to get out of here together , " says stanley .
" and one day we 'll make it to europe .

i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder announced at a brief news conference following a telephone conversation with berlusconi earlier in the day . schröder had demanded a full apology from italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt to a german member of the european parliament made in the european parliament on wednesday . schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed mep martin schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content " .
to applause from the german parliament , schröder said he expected berlusconi to " apologize fully for this unacceptable comparison " . outrage at home and abroad berlusconi caused an uproar in the european parliament on wednesday when he made the remarks following comments by schulz , who had repeatedly criticized the italian prime minister for his use of an immunity law to sidestep bribery charges in a milan court . the incident triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries . schröder 's office immediately summoned the italian ambassador to berlin and the italian foreign ministry responded by summoning the german envoy to condemn the comments made by schulz , saying he had made an " unacceptable offence " to berlusconi . in addition , the issue has fuelled widely-held concerns over berlusconi 's ability to provide eu leadership at a time when the union faces unprecedented challenges , including the securing of an agreement over the draft european constitution and the healing of the transatlantic rift .
italy took up the rotating eu presidency on july 1 . raw feelings schröder said on thursday that he hoped italy 's eu presidency would get back on track and that any further steps that might be taken over the affair were now the responsibility of the european parliament . " i expressed my hope that everybody must concentrate on making sure that europe moves forward with its business , " he said . however , the dispute is far from over and feelings are still raw .
" given the major sensitivities involved it would have been better for berlusconi to withdraw the remark immediately , " the dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende told dutch news agency anp .
" it is a sensitive issue and could hurt people . "
the luxembourg government said prime minister jean-claude juncker was " shocked " by what it described as berlusconi 's unacceptable comments . and at a meeting in strasbourg , tensions rose as european parliament leaders failed to agree at an emergency meeting to demand that berlusconi make amends . still highly sensitive topic germany is still highly sensitive about its nazi past . last year , a remark made by the then justice minister herta däubler-gmelin comparing president bush 's policies on iraq to methods adopted by adolf hitler sparked outrage both at home and abroad , leading to the further souring of relations between the united states and germany . also last year , a remark made by former conservative chancellor helmut kohl for likening the social democrat speaker of german parliament to the president of the nazi-dominated reichstag , hermann goering , sparked a public dispute with schröder demanding an apology . and roland koch , hardline conservative premier of the german state hesse , caused outrage when , during a debate on federal government plans to introduce a wealth tax , he said that rich people were being singled out as if they had a " new form of a star on their chest " , referring to the jew 's suffering under hitler . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliamentarians give berlusconi an " f " in a highly defensive appearance before the european parliament on wednesday , italy 's prime minister alienated many with his nazi jokes .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .

the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year . after years of wrangling , the european parliament has finally fired the starting gun on the world 's first international emissions trading market by voting to cap european industry 's carbon dioxide output and let firms trade the right to pollute . the european union 's assembly on wednesday passed a bill which means that from january 2005 - three years earlier than laid out in the 1997 united nations kyoto protocol - many electricity generators and plants in the oil refining , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors will be issued with " carbon credits " to emit carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- . " it means that the architecture foreseen under the kyoto protocol is coming to life , " eu environment commissioner margot wallstrom said in a statement released after the vote . the new rules will apply to 25 members of the eu , including the countries joining next year , and is expected to improve climate conservation . governments are to allocate the co2 credits by next march to some 10,000 companies across europe , which cause almost half of the eu 's carbon dioxide emissions .
if they manage to keep emissions below their entitlement , they stand to make money . companies using more environmentally-friendly technologies that emit less pollutants can sell their credits to power stations and any other firms exceeding their co2 limits .
a company will also be able to buy credits to emit carbon from another company which couldn ’ t afford the fuel that would pollute in the first place .
business concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will form the cornerstone of the eu 's efforts to meet its commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent from their 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012 .
the eu has led a campaign to persuade other industrialized countries to join it in ratifying the protocol .
but given that in 2001 , emissions of greenhouse gases increased for the second year running , it 's not yet certain that the eu will be able to keep to its promise .
germany , europe 's worst offender when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions , is still two percentage points off its target of a 21 percent reduction in emissions .
in 2001 , the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty , saying it would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
the hard stance of the bush administration has led other nations , such as australia , to follow suit .
many european companies are now concerned that the eu clampdown on emissions will make them less competitive .
and the treaty does n't constrain emissions from industrializing countries such as india and china .
a spokeswoman from the unice , the eu employers confederation , pointed out on tuesday that " this is a good solution at the european level , but a major issue , having europe 's partners on board , remains to be settled . "
russia holds key to kyoto according to a complex weighting system , russian ratification will determine whether the kyoto treaty will actually enter into force in 2008 , as planned .
only if nations accounting for 55 percent of emissions sign up , can the treaty become international law .
russia is still wavering , citing economic interests as a reason .
even though russian prime minister mikhail kasyanov announced at the earth summit in johannesburg last year that moscow would ratify kyoto " in the near future " , russia is still concerned that billions of dollars it might have earned by selling " rights to pollute " are in doubt , since the u.s , the biggest potential buyer , is not on board .
germany set to save analysts have predicted trades in the right to emit co2 among the 10,000 plants affected could be worth up to eight billion euros a year by 2007 , creating a new financial market place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final version of the law - which still needs approval from eu member states - will include an opt-out clause for companies which can show they are making an equivalent effort to reduce greenhouse gases . in germany , where industry has a number of agreements with the government to reduce emissions , factories may well use this option .
according to a study conducted by the german environment ministry , germany 's relatively stringent environmental laws might mean that emissions trading saves the german industry millions per year . in march 2002 , germany was the first major industrialized country to formally ratify the kyoto protocol on climate change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes steps towards kyoto with co2 trading market eu ministers have agreed on a trading market that will allow polluting countries in europe to buy and sell ' greenhouse gas ' quotas in a bid to meet the kyoto protocol 's carbon dioxide reduction schedule -lrb- december 12 , 2002 -rrb- bonn climate conference ends on upbeat note a two-week u.n. climate conference in bonn , which ended friday , for the first time focussed on concrete projects in developing nations designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases widely blamed for global warming -lrb- june 14 , 2003 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2003 schröder pushes opposition onto defensive over reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder : co-opting a few ideas from the opposition .
with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .
he thanked the parties for working on planned reforms to the public health care system while admonishing them not to reject the current reforms and tax cuts , saying such a move " would not pay off . " trouble for the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and angela merkel schröder 's policies are extremely similar to those being proposed by the conservative union bloc , which has put politicians like the cdu 's angela merkel -lrb- photo right -rrb- and the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- photo left -rrb- on the defensive in recent weeks . schröder has effectively taken the wind out of their sails by adopting the union 's earlier calls for the tax cut to be pushed ahead .

the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .
in addition to the tax cuts , the government will loosening its regulation for skilled handworkers and reduce expensive bureaucracy .
schröder said small- to medium-sized businesses could expect to pay € 10 billion fewer taxes in 2004 .
-lrb- the tax cuts had originally been planned for 2005 , but with shrinking economic growth , schröder 's cabinet wants to pull them forward a year . -rrb- in his speech , schröder expressed optimism that consumers would spend their tax savings to give the economy the desired boost .
" ten percent fewer taxes – that 's ten percent more that people will have available to fulfil their life 's desires , " he said . germany , schröder noted , represents 30 percent of the entire european economy – a status that bestows it with a " special responsibility , " because " without a strong germany , there can be no strong europe . "
for that reason , it is dire that germany undertake both structural and economic measures in order to promote stability and economic growth , he said . though conceding the myriad reforms would be painful , schröder said germany needed to adopt a " new thinking , " requiring a change in the mentality that puts an emphasis on quality of life .
he said there were signs that during the three months since he first laid out agenda 2010 that the transformation was beginning .
" germany is ready to change , " he said , before adding , " germany is on the move . " a plea to the other side much of his speech seemed directed at the opposition christian democrats , and schröder called on the conservatives to fully cooperate with his reform plans . schröder said the country 's political parties must work together to bring germany " back into step . "
without the support of the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , schröder 's reform plans will stall in the bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber controlled by the opposition . " we are seeking to constructively work together with the majority in the bundesrat , " schröder assured his audience of parliamentarians .
he thanked the parties for working on planned reforms to the public health care system while admonishing them not to reject the current reforms and tax cuts , saying such a move " would not pay off . " trouble for the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and angela merkel schröder 's policies are extremely similar to those being proposed by the conservative union bloc , which has put politicians like the cdu 's angela merkel -lrb- photo right -rrb- and the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- photo left -rrb- on the defensive in recent weeks . schröder has effectively taken the wind out of their sails by adopting the union 's earlier calls for the tax cut to be pushed ahead .
in recent days , there has been considerable fighting between the cdu and csu over whether to support schröder 's tax reform plan or to block it – an embarrassing spat for the opposition , which has long championed exactly the kinds of cuts the government is seeking to push through . the conservatives are now faced with a difficult decision : block schröder 's reforms and hope he his blamed for the failure , or support the reforms and allow the chancellor to take credit for ideas they long ago pitched on their own . the depth of this crisis was apparent in the rebuttal given by cdu chairwoman angela merkel , who attacked schröder for changing the tack of government : " what is the direction of your policies ? " she asked .

with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice . in a move taken straight out of the political cookbook of bill clinton or tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder in recent weeks has been swiftly appropriating the policies of the conservative opposition , leaving them increasingly on the defensive .
the scope of the similarities between those reform proposals crystalized during a speech given by schröder before parliament on thursday . with three straight years of meagre economic growth , record unemployment and rising bankruptcies , schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens wants to push through a broad structural and economic reform package aimed at restoring germany as the european union 's economic powerhouse and moving a step closer towards balancing the federal budget . the economic overhaul includes a 10 percent reduction in income taxes starting next year , financed by cuts in major government subsidies and sales of state-owned enterprises .
among the subsidies under the knife are benefits for first-time home buyers , tax breaks for commuters , coal industry support and other programs .
additionally , schröder 's agenda 2010 plan would place caps on unemployment benefits and change labor laws to make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
agenda 2010 alone , he said , would save the government € 45 billion -lrb- $ 52 billion -rrb- by 2010 . taken together , the government believes the changes will stimulate economic growth and help bring down the country ’ s chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers over 10 percent . breaks for small businesses schröder said the tax cuts are aimed not only at individuals , but also at small- to medium-sized businesses , which make up half of germany 's economic output and employ close to 70 percent of its workers .

long famous for its markets , tangier is now home to a camp that illustrates a darker side of trade : human trafficking .
it 's a station for sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in europe .
but many never make it . tangier , morocco - " i think about god .
i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .
if the neighbor earns 200,000 francs , then i have to earn more .
and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be immigrants are helped by spanish soldiers on the punta paloma beach in tarifa , spain , on may 8 , 2003 .
some 50 immigrants survived the crossing arriving in a small boat from morocco .
spain is encountering a similar surge in illegal immigration .
the government detained 23,381 people trying to enter the continent from morocco in 2002 .
and the spanish interior ministry reported in 2002 that it had busted 735 human trafficking rings , up from 362 the year before .
the moroccan workers ' and immigrants ' association in spain -lrb- atime -rrb- has estimated that 4,000 people have died since 1997 crossing the strait of gibraltar or the slip of ocean separating africa from spain ’ s canary islands .
governments across europe are seeking to take action , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the rotating president of the european union , has said he will make combating illegal immigration a priority during his six months at the helm .
berlusconi has called for the creation of a european border patrol agency to scan the waters for illegal immigrants as well as the establishment of detainment centers outside the eu for illegal immigrants .
in the mean time , the immigrants keep coming and the dangers continue to grow .
shuffling from border to border more than 100 people are gathered in a temporary tent made of cellophane here in tangier .
as long as they have a little pocket money on them , the police continue to look the other way .
some women are so desperate to stay here that they 're willing to sell their bodies to raise the necessary cash .
occasionally there are police raids and some of the refugees are taken back to the algerian border .
but they just hop on the next bus back to tangier .
just as the police in tangier are happy to look the other way , so are the border guards in algeria .
some refugees have been traveling back and forth between the two countries for six months .
" i went through algeria until i could get over here ... the hard way , " says a man named oscar .
" i had to travel across the desert to get to morocco .
normally the trip takes eight months , but if you have enough money you can do it in five months .
i was really lucky to have made it this far . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish civil guard has its hands full trying to intercept rickety boats bound for its coasts from north africa .
the illegal immigrants in tangier are in a quandary .
the spanish government recently erected a $ 120 million radar system along the coast that serves as an electronic fence between the spanish port city of algeciras and tangier .
since then , it 's become much more difficult for refugee boats to get across to the european continent .
some now try to make it as far as the canary islands .
others try to make it to libya , where many boats are now heading for italy .
but to do so , they must first cross algeria – a large , dangerous and , for the immigrants , expensive land .
others opt to stay here in the make-shift camp and continue dreaming of el dorado .
stanley is among them .
" we 're trying to get out of here together , " says stanley .
" and one day we 'll make it to europe .

long famous for its markets , tangier is now home to a camp that illustrates a darker side of trade : human trafficking .
it 's a station for sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in europe .
but many never make it . tangier , morocco - " i think about god .
i search for him because maybe he can help me scrape together a little money .
i 'd be very grateful to him , " says a young man who calls himself stanley .
one day , stanley believes , his dream will come true .
for months , he 's been living in a refugee camp near tangier , morocco , waiting for his chance to cross the mediterranean in a small boat to a better life in europe , the el dorado of his dreams .
" i want to go to germany , " he says .
" if god be willing , i will go to germany .
i 'm a mechanic and i can work for a lot of different companies .
i 'm also a soccer player .
in lagos i played in the second nigerian league .
there 's just a problem with money in nigeria and that 's why i want to go to europe . "
another man , who calls himself ian , has no money , no family and nothing to look back to but a bleak future at home .
" our monthly wages are n't enough to even establish a family , " he laments .
" that 's why we have to first go to europe and look around before we would even be able to come back home , where our girlfriends are waiting . "
a man named paul from cameroon is also waiting for pennies from heaven .
" in europe , you can earn a lot of money and you can lead a decent life – you can even become a millionaire .
that 's what we hear on tv , " paul says .
" we always want to out do each other .
if the neighbor earns 200,000 francs , then i have to earn more .
and the only way to become a real man is to go to europe and come back with a lot of money .
that so many people wind up here -lsb- in this camp -rsb- is unknown – it 's never mentioned on television and nobody talks about it .
only the newspapers and foreign media report it . "
a station on the route to europe the tangier camp is one of many staging grounds in northern africa for the human trafficking trade to europe – one of the first stations for illegal immigrants en route to the european union .
traveling in rickety boats , the long journey ends in tragedy for many .
in june , 200 would-be immigrants drowned when the boat they were traveling on sank off the tunisian coast .
italian officials believe that 3,000 illegal immigrants from africa made it to shore that month alone .
others are caught and placed in detention centers until they can be deported back to africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would-be immigrants are helped by spanish soldiers on the punta paloma beach in tarifa , spain , on may 8 , 2003 .
some 50 immigrants survived the crossing arriving in a small boat from morocco .
spain is encountering a similar surge in illegal immigration .
the government detained 23,381 people trying to enter the continent from morocco in 2002 .
and the spanish interior ministry reported in 2002 that it had busted 735 human trafficking rings , up from 362 the year before .
the moroccan workers ' and immigrants ' association in spain -lrb- atime -rrb- has estimated that 4,000 people have died since 1997 crossing the strait of gibraltar or the slip of ocean separating africa from spain ’ s canary islands .
governments across europe are seeking to take action , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , the rotating president of the european union , has said he will make combating illegal immigration a priority during his six months at the helm .
berlusconi has called for the creation of a european border patrol agency to scan the waters for illegal immigrants as well as the establishment of detainment centers outside the eu for illegal immigrants .
in the mean time , the immigrants keep coming and the dangers continue to grow .
shuffling from border to border more than 100 people are gathered in a temporary tent made of cellophane here in tangier .
as long as they have a little pocket money on them , the police continue to look the other way .
some women are so desperate to stay here that they 're willing to sell their bodies to raise the necessary cash .
occasionally there are police raids and some of the refugees are taken back to the algerian border .
but they just hop on the next bus back to tangier .
just as the police in tangier are happy to look the other way , so are the border guards in algeria .
some refugees have been traveling back and forth between the two countries for six months .
" i went through algeria until i could get over here ... the hard way , " says a man named oscar .
" i had to travel across the desert to get to morocco .
normally the trip takes eight months , but if you have enough money you can do it in five months .
i was really lucky to have made it this far . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish civil guard has its hands full trying to intercept rickety boats bound for its coasts from north africa .
the illegal immigrants in tangier are in a quandary .
the spanish government recently erected a $ 120 million radar system along the coast that serves as an electronic fence between the spanish port city of algeciras and tangier .
since then , it 's become much more difficult for refugee boats to get across to the european continent .
some now try to make it as far as the canary islands .
others try to make it to libya , where many boats are now heading for italy .
but to do so , they must first cross algeria – a large , dangerous and , for the immigrants , expensive land .
others opt to stay here in the make-shift camp and continue dreaming of el dorado .
stanley is among them .
" we 're trying to get out of here together , " says stanley .
" and one day we 'll make it to europe .

fuzeon , which is manufactured by roche , is aimed at patients who are not responding to some existing treatments .
unlike other drugs , it works by blocking the virus and stopping it from entering healthy immune cells .
other drugs attack the virus when it is inside these cells .
new class it is the first new class of hiv drug for seven years .
the drug is administered by injection twice a day and is used in combination with other drugs .
this is to prevent it from being broken down by the body 's digestive system .
research published by the new england journal of medicine found that hiv patients who took fuzeon in combination with other drugs were twice as likely to achieve undetectable levels of the virus compared to those who did not take the drug .
for fuzeon to work , we need to find two other drugs that the patient will respond to dr mark nelson , chelsea and westminster hospital ' i take the drug ' will cost be a factor ?
it was also able to suppress hiv levels in patients who had developed resistance to other drugs .
however , it is expensive .
fuzeon costs £ 12,905 a year , twice as much as alternative treatments .
roche has acknowledged that the cost means that it is unlikely to benefit people living in poorer countries .
it is expected to be of immediate benefit to around 100 people across the uk .
but it could be of benefit to many more in the future .
figures suggest that as many as one in four newly-diagnosed hiv positive patients have strains resistant to existing drugs .
one of the drawbacks is that it must be used in combination with other drugs to have maximum effect .
as a result , it will only benefit patients who respond to at least some of the existing drugs .
resistance problems dr mark nelson , director of hiv services at london 's chelsea and westminster hospital , said the drug is already being prescribed to 20 patients who attend his clinic .
but he added that it did not completely solve the problem of drug-resistant hiv .
" patients with hiv are treated with a combination of three drugs .
for fuzeon to work , we need to find two other drugs that the patient will respond to , " he told bbc news online .
" without other new drugs which are active against the virus , it is unlikely to benefit patients who are resistant to existing treatments . "
dr nelson said patients were unlikely to be denied the drug because of its high cost .
" although it is expensive , if it keeps someone well it is worthwhile because of the costs to the nhs of having people in hospital and also the cost to society as a whole . "
jack summerside from the uk charity terrence higgins trust said : " fuzeon is an important extra treatment option for people with hiv , particularly for those who have used up other treatments available .
" but it is costly and even more difficult to take than existing hiv medications .
science is still a long way from finding a cure for hiv . "

fuzeon , which is manufactured by roche , is aimed at patients who are not responding to some existing treatments .
unlike other drugs , it works by blocking the virus and stopping it from entering healthy immune cells .
other drugs attack the virus when it is inside these cells .
new class it is the first new class of hiv drug for seven years .
the drug is administered by injection twice a day and is used in combination with other drugs .
this is to prevent it from being broken down by the body 's digestive system .
research published by the new england journal of medicine found that hiv patients who took fuzeon in combination with other drugs were twice as likely to achieve undetectable levels of the virus compared to those who did not take the drug .
for fuzeon to work , we need to find two other drugs that the patient will respond to dr mark nelson , chelsea and westminster hospital ' i take the drug ' will cost be a factor ?
it was also able to suppress hiv levels in patients who had developed resistance to other drugs .
however , it is expensive .
fuzeon costs £ 12,905 a year , twice as much as alternative treatments .
roche has acknowledged that the cost means that it is unlikely to benefit people living in poorer countries .
it is expected to be of immediate benefit to around 100 people across the uk .
but it could be of benefit to many more in the future .
figures suggest that as many as one in four newly-diagnosed hiv positive patients have strains resistant to existing drugs .
one of the drawbacks is that it must be used in combination with other drugs to have maximum effect .
as a result , it will only benefit patients who respond to at least some of the existing drugs .
resistance problems dr mark nelson , director of hiv services at london 's chelsea and westminster hospital , said the drug is already being prescribed to 20 patients who attend his clinic .
but he added that it did not completely solve the problem of drug-resistant hiv .
" patients with hiv are treated with a combination of three drugs .
for fuzeon to work , we need to find two other drugs that the patient will respond to , " he told bbc news online .
" without other new drugs which are active against the virus , it is unlikely to benefit patients who are resistant to existing treatments . "
dr nelson said patients were unlikely to be denied the drug because of its high cost .
" although it is expensive , if it keeps someone well it is worthwhile because of the costs to the nhs of having people in hospital and also the cost to society as a whole . "
jack summerside from the uk charity terrence higgins trust said : " fuzeon is an important extra treatment option for people with hiv , particularly for those who have used up other treatments available .

they found that , in some cases , the introduced cells do proliferate and spread throughout the chimaeric embryo .
their hope is that having even a small proportion of cells from a healthy embryo might prevent certain genetic diseases from arising .

dr norbert gliecher , who led the research , told the european society for human reproduction and embryology annual meeting in madrid : " it is not ready for clinical application in humans - i do n't want to suggest that .
" but further exploration in animals is warranted - and who knows where this will take us ? "
joined up the potential for cells from two different embryos to fuse and become one " combination " individual is well known in nature - there have been examples where this has happened in early pregnancy in humans , with no apparent ill-effects on the resulting baby .
the theory behind gliecher 's work is that some studies have suggested that in certain diseases caused by a single genetic defect , having even as few as 15 % of the body 's cells free from the defect might be enough to stop the development of the disease .
he said his experiment showed that just a couple of cells injected into the embryo produced an embryo with , in many cases , an even distribution of cells carrying these new genes .
he deliberately injected a male cell into a female embryo - which created an " intersex " embryo , but allowed him to use chemical tests to check the process of the chromosome unique to male cells .
gleicher said that a couple having embryos screened for a single-gene disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency disorder -lrb- scid -rrb- might end up with two embryos , one of which had the disease and one which did not .
in this instance , he said , it might be possible to take cells from the " good " embryo and put them into the defective one , producing two viable embryos , whereas previously , the defective one would have to be discarded .
however , his experiment was roundly attacked by senior scientists at the conference .
' no logic ' professor alan trounson , a pioneer of ivf in australia , told bbc news online : " i really ca n't see the logic of what he is trying to do - it seems completely flawed to me . "
he said that it would be impossible to test whether the correct versions of the genes had been incorporated widely into the embryo before a decision had to be made whether to transfer it back into the woman .
he said that the health risks of producing a chimaeric individual were still uncertain .
" unless you can be certain you are doing some good , you should not be doing something that could cause harm . "
he said that the us team should not even attempt to continue their experiments in animals .
professor lyn fraser , a past president of the society , told the bbc that she shared the disquiet over the technique .

plans to reintroduce red kites to gateshead were announced on thursday .
the birds - which have a five-foot wingspan - were a familiar sight scavenging in the streets of medieval britain .
but they were exterminated by gamekeepers in the 19th century and have never returned to the north east .
gateshead council wants to reintroduce the wild birds to the derwent valley , across the a1 motorway from the metrocentre , and hopes they will become a major tourist attraction .
it is hoped the first group of up to 30 red kites could be soaring in north east skies as early as next summer .
red kites are beautiful and majestic birds and popular with the public patrick thompson , rspb gateshead councillor michael mcnestry said : " we have seen what ospreys have done to boost the lake district 's economy and i 'm confident that this project can do something similar for gateshead .
" i hope that , in the near future , the sight of red kites soaring over the river derwent will become a familiar one to visitors and local people . "
during the past 15 years , young red kites have been moved from healthy breeding populations in wales and released into the wild in suitable areas of england and scotland .
the plan is supported by english nature and the rspb on behalf of a partnership that includes gateshead council , northumbrian water , the national trust and forest enterprise .
first steps gateshead council has pledged £ 50,000 per year to the project and northumbrian water £ 15,000 for each of the first two years .
the proposal is for the project to run for five years , with releases of kites taking place each year .
john barrett of english nature , said : " we are absolutely delighted to be taking the first steps towards restoring this magnificent bird to its rightful place in the north east countryside . "
patrick thompson of the rspb added : " red kites are beautiful and majestic birds and popular with the public .
" evidence from other re-introduction areas suggests that local communities , tourism and the regional economy have all benefited from the return of the red kite . "

plans to reintroduce red kites to gateshead were announced on thursday .
the birds - which have a five-foot wingspan - were a familiar sight scavenging in the streets of medieval britain .
but they were exterminated by gamekeepers in the 19th century and have never returned to the north east .
gateshead council wants to reintroduce the wild birds to the derwent valley , across the a1 motorway from the metrocentre , and hopes they will become a major tourist attraction .
it is hoped the first group of up to 30 red kites could be soaring in north east skies as early as next summer .
red kites are beautiful and majestic birds and popular with the public patrick thompson , rspb gateshead councillor michael mcnestry said : " we have seen what ospreys have done to boost the lake district 's economy and i 'm confident that this project can do something similar for gateshead .
" i hope that , in the near future , the sight of red kites soaring over the river derwent will become a familiar one to visitors and local people . "
during the past 15 years , young red kites have been moved from healthy breeding populations in wales and released into the wild in suitable areas of england and scotland .
the plan is supported by english nature and the rspb on behalf of a partnership that includes gateshead council , northumbrian water , the national trust and forest enterprise .
first steps gateshead council has pledged £ 50,000 per year to the project and northumbrian water £ 15,000 for each of the first two years .
the proposal is for the project to run for five years , with releases of kites taking place each year .

patrick thompson of the rspb added : " red kites are beautiful and majestic birds and popular with the public .

plans to reintroduce red kites to gateshead were announced on thursday .
the birds - which have a five-foot wingspan - were a familiar sight scavenging in the streets of medieval britain .
but they were exterminated by gamekeepers in the 19th century and have never returned to the north east .
gateshead council wants to reintroduce the wild birds to the derwent valley , across the a1 motorway from the metrocentre , and hopes they will become a major tourist attraction .

" i hope that , in the near future , the sight of red kites soaring over the river derwent will become a familiar one to visitors and local people . "
during the past 15 years , young red kites have been moved from healthy breeding populations in wales and released into the wild in suitable areas of england and scotland .
the plan is supported by english nature and the rspb on behalf of a partnership that includes gateshead council , northumbrian water , the national trust and forest enterprise .
first steps gateshead council has pledged £ 50,000 per year to the project and northumbrian water £ 15,000 for each of the first two years .
the proposal is for the project to run for five years , with releases of kites taking place each year .
