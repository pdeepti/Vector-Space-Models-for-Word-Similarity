program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2003 christmas in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may not have the nuremburg christmas market , but soldiers in kabul will have plenty of holiday treats this year .
hundreds of german peacekeepers stationed in afghanistan are gearing up for a christmas far away from home and family .
but they 're pulling out all the stops and celebrating with christmas trees , gifts and mass . amidst the dry desert landscape of afghanistan and several thousand miles away from home and loved ones , over 2,000 german soldiers working to keep the peace are preparing to take a break from their security duties and celebrate christmas .
the military headquarters of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the capital of kabul is beginning to resemble a german town just before the festive season .
the smell of traditional baking wafts out from the special christmas market erected for the troops , a stuffed elk surfs on a green snowboard to the beat of the music on a christmas store counter , the dining room is aglow with colorful lights , homemade cookies are piled high on the tables and candles and wreaths decorate most of the usually plain rooms .
even the first pine trees have finally arrived , flown in all the way from germany .
vital link to home the post office at isaf headquarters has witnessed hectic activity since early december .
more than five tons of letters and packages have already been sent back and forth between germany and afghanistan .
post office worker burkhard opitz said that early planning was a must for soldiers who wanted their packages to reach home in time to be put under the christmas tree on dec .
24 .
" here the christmas traffic had to be pulled forward because of all the flying , since it all also depends on the weather .
we had a dec .
5 deadline , which means it ’ s better to play safe because all the mail has to go through customs in speyer , germany , " he explained .
" a slice of home " for the two german military priests based in afghanistan , christmas eve is expected to bring a whole load of work .
they are scheduled to hold services in the base camp , the isaf headquarters as well as for the soldiers , who are stationed at the kabul airport .
protestant priest jens hausschild said he expected huge crowds to attend the mass in the base camp .
" after all it ’ s no normal sunday , but christmas eve .
that ’ s why we ’ re going to be celebrating in our auditorium , an event tent formerly used as a fitness studio and cinema hall .
lots of people can fit in there . "
hausschild ’ s catholic colleague , joseph gertz , added , " we ’ re going to celebrate mass in the same way that we do at home .
i think it ’ s important because it ’ s a slice of home . "
song and food in keeping with efforts to recreate a normal christmas , the priests have also organized a christmas choir .
for weeks , 14 soldiers have been training their vocal chords to belt out one christmas song after the other under the guidance of gertz , who is also the choir director .
and much like christmas the world over , food will form the centerpiece of the festivities at the isaf headquarters .
soldiers at the camp have long been earnestly speculating on the finer details of the christmas spread .
one of the soldiers was hardly able to contain his enthusiasm .
" there ’ s a plan and if we stick to it .
we ’ re going to get something delicious to eat .
i think there ’ s going to be goose .
and since we ’ re multinational , there will also be specialties from england , america , canada .

the americans fell in love with one of the wohlfaharts ’ own beloved family keepsakes , a hand crafted christmas music boxes from the harz mountains .
asking around , the wohlfahrts were told it would be impossible to get another one until the following spring , and then they would have to buy at least ten of them . the japan connection they bought it , eventually gave the gift , and sold the rest to american soldiers ’ families stationed nearby .
thus the year-round christmas village concept was born . now , clients come not just from america , but from around the world .
they snatch up the company 's hallmark decorations to the tune of close to € 20 million a year . ironically , many of the wohlfahrt ’ s clients are japanese , despite the fact that the overwhelmingly buddhist and shintoist country doesn ’ t celebrate christmas as it is known in the west .
but as with other western traditions , christmas decoration is beginning to seep into the asian culture . emi kanazawa , a japanese who lives in germany , works at wohlfahrt , mostly serving japanese customers .
in japan , she says , “ -lrb- dec .
24 -rrb- is a normal workday .
only some families with small children celebrate at home , make a good meal and the kids get presents . ” adds company spokeswoman felicitas höpner : “ the japanese come to rothenburg because they find the medieval village typically german .
they come to the christmas village because they like to decorate .
they see that in germany people decorate for christmas , that it ’ s special . ” she notes that the japanese clients are especially drawn to wohlfahrt ’ s hand-painted wooden articles due to the quality of craftsmanship – a point of pride with the 200 person , family-run company .
wohlfart has its own design workshop , where everything from rosy-cheeked wooden incense-burning santas known as “ knoddeln ” to limited-edition porcelain angels is designed .
thereafter , “ the production is given over to traditional craft-making firms throughout germany , ” höpner explains . mom-and-pop empire “ made in germany ” is an important phrase for the wohlfahrt company : “ quality for us means that our products are … made by german companies .
we control to make sure the craftsmanship is first class … for example , the painting should be right there where it belongs - not like in many things that are made cheaply in the far east , where one eyebrow is a half a millimeter higher than the other . ” despite its tradition , wohlfahrt ’ s is anything but your typical mom-and-pop store - more like an empire .
a brief look at their web site -lrb- you can also order from an online catalog -rrb- shows that wohlfahrt runs seven stores in rothenburg alone , all honing in on a slightly different segment of the souvenir market .
there are six more stores in germany , located in tourism hot spots such as oberammergau , garmisch partenkirchen , heidelberg - and christmas über-mecca nüremberg . and the company has reached further afield , to quaint tourist towns in riquewihr -lrb- alsace -rrb- , france , and bruges , belgium , as well as making an appearance at the christmas markets this year in florence , italy , and osaka and sapporo , japan . its popularity world-wide notwithstanding , it seems wohlfahrt hasn ’ t forgotten its roots or the first music boxes it sold to american military families .
in 2001 , the company opened its first store in the u.s. , located in stillwater , minnesota .

they come from as nearby as switzerland , as far away as japan .
they are lovers of christmas decoration as only the germans can do it : nutcracker-soldiers and music boxes , hanging glass ornaments and nativity figures , all of it handmade and hand-painted . they come looking for their mecca , and they find it , open 12 months each year : käthe wohlfahrt ’ s christmas village . the name christmas village is more than just a clever title .
the interior of the store is actually built to resemble a bavarian village square , with stalls decorated as typical snow-covered , half-timbered houses surrounding a 16-foot-tall christmas tree .

they come from as nearby as switzerland , as far away as japan .
they are lovers of christmas decoration as only the germans can do it : nutcracker-soldiers and music boxes , hanging glass ornaments and nativity figures , all of it handmade and hand-painted . they come looking for their mecca , and they find it , open 12 months each year : käthe wohlfahrt ’ s christmas village . the name christmas village is more than just a clever title .
the interior of the store is actually built to resemble a bavarian village square , with stalls decorated as typical snow-covered , half-timbered houses surrounding a 16-foot-tall christmas tree .
stars twinkle overhead as visitors stroll cobblestone “ streets . ”
a 12-foot-tall nutcracker-soldier stands guard at the doorway to the village , an acquiescent photo-op companion for any and all . in its quaintness , the christmas village -lrb- decorated with more than three miles of christmas garland and over 80,000 artificial lights -rrb- offers up heavy competition to the astonishingly preserved medieval town of rothenburg ob der tauber , itself one of germany ’ s top tourist destinations . a hand-crafted music box in some parts of the world , of course , a shop dedicated to selling christmas wares year round may seem old hat .
-lrb- in the united states , for example , such stores have been around for a good two decades . -rrb-
but in germany , where traditions run deep , christmas decorations are on the shelves from late november until dec .
24 , and as a rule can not be had again until the following year . this was the situation in the early 1960s , when the wohlfahrt family was celebrating christmas with american military friends .
the americans fell in love with one of the wohlfaharts ’ own beloved family keepsakes , a hand crafted christmas music boxes from the harz mountains .
asking around , the wohlfahrts were told it would be impossible to get another one until the following spring , and then they would have to buy at least ten of them . the japan connection they bought it , eventually gave the gift , and sold the rest to american soldiers ’ families stationed nearby .
thus the year-round christmas village concept was born . now , clients come not just from america , but from around the world .
they snatch up the company 's hallmark decorations to the tune of close to € 20 million a year . ironically , many of the wohlfahrt ’ s clients are japanese , despite the fact that the overwhelmingly buddhist and shintoist country doesn ’ t celebrate christmas as it is known in the west .
but as with other western traditions , christmas decoration is beginning to seep into the asian culture . emi kanazawa , a japanese who lives in germany , works at wohlfahrt , mostly serving japanese customers .
in japan , she says , “ -lrb- dec .
24 -rrb- is a normal workday .
only some families with small children celebrate at home , make a good meal and the kids get presents . ” adds company spokeswoman felicitas höpner : “ the japanese come to rothenburg because they find the medieval village typically german .
they come to the christmas village because they like to decorate .
they see that in germany people decorate for christmas , that it ’ s special . ” she notes that the japanese clients are especially drawn to wohlfahrt ’ s hand-painted wooden articles due to the quality of craftsmanship – a point of pride with the 200 person , family-run company .
wohlfart has its own design workshop , where everything from rosy-cheeked wooden incense-burning santas known as “ knoddeln ” to limited-edition porcelain angels is designed .
thereafter , “ the production is given over to traditional craft-making firms throughout germany , ” höpner explains . mom-and-pop empire “ made in germany ” is an important phrase for the wohlfahrt company : “ quality for us means that our products are … made by german companies .
we control to make sure the craftsmanship is first class … for example , the painting should be right there where it belongs - not like in many things that are made cheaply in the far east , where one eyebrow is a half a millimeter higher than the other . ” despite its tradition , wohlfahrt ’ s is anything but your typical mom-and-pop store - more like an empire .
a brief look at their web site -lrb- you can also order from an online catalog -rrb- shows that wohlfahrt runs seven stores in rothenburg alone , all honing in on a slightly different segment of the souvenir market .
there are six more stores in germany , located in tourism hot spots such as oberammergau , garmisch partenkirchen , heidelberg - and christmas über-mecca nüremberg . and the company has reached further afield , to quaint tourist towns in riquewihr -lrb- alsace -rrb- , france , and bruges , belgium , as well as making an appearance at the christmas markets this year in florence , italy , and osaka and sapporo , japan . its popularity world-wide notwithstanding , it seems wohlfahrt hasn ’ t forgotten its roots or the first music boxes it sold to american military families .
in 2001 , the company opened its first store in the u.s. , located in stillwater , minnesota .
and holders of military id cards can get wohlfart goods at four military-base stores in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg , city of angels in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .

the military headquarters of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the capital of kabul is beginning to resemble a german town just before the festive season .
the smell of traditional baking wafts out from the special christmas market erected for the troops , a stuffed elk surfs on a green snowboard to the beat of the music on a christmas store counter , the dining room is aglow with colorful lights , homemade cookies are piled high on the tables and candles and wreaths decorate most of the usually plain rooms .
even the first pine trees have finally arrived , flown in all the way from germany .
vital link to home the post office at isaf headquarters has witnessed hectic activity since early december .
more than five tons of letters and packages have already been sent back and forth between germany and afghanistan .
post office worker burkhard opitz said that early planning was a must for soldiers who wanted their packages to reach home in time to be put under the christmas tree on dec .
24 .
" here the christmas traffic had to be pulled forward because of all the flying , since it all also depends on the weather .
we had a dec .
5 deadline , which means it ’ s better to play safe because all the mail has to go through customs in speyer , germany , " he explained .
" a slice of home " for the two german military priests based in afghanistan , christmas eve is expected to bring a whole load of work .
they are scheduled to hold services in the base camp , the isaf headquarters as well as for the soldiers , who are stationed at the kabul airport .
protestant priest jens hausschild said he expected huge crowds to attend the mass in the base camp .
" after all it ’ s no normal sunday , but christmas eve .
that ’ s why we ’ re going to be celebrating in our auditorium , an event tent formerly used as a fitness studio and cinema hall .
lots of people can fit in there . "
hausschild ’ s catholic colleague , joseph gertz , added , " we ’ re going to celebrate mass in the same way that we do at home .
i think it ’ s important because it ’ s a slice of home . "
song and food in keeping with efforts to recreate a normal christmas , the priests have also organized a christmas choir .
for weeks , 14 soldiers have been training their vocal chords to belt out one christmas song after the other under the guidance of gertz , who is also the choir director .
and much like christmas the world over , food will form the centerpiece of the festivities at the isaf headquarters .
soldiers at the camp have long been earnestly speculating on the finer details of the christmas spread .
one of the soldiers was hardly able to contain his enthusiasm .
" there ’ s a plan and if we stick to it .
we ’ re going to get something delicious to eat .
i think there ’ s going to be goose .
and since we ’ re multinational , there will also be specialties from england , america , canada .

they come from as nearby as switzerland , as far away as japan .
they are lovers of christmas decoration as only the germans can do it : nutcracker-soldiers and music boxes , hanging glass ornaments and nativity figures , all of it handmade and hand-painted . they come looking for their mecca , and they find it , open 12 months each year : käthe wohlfahrt ’ s christmas village . the name christmas village is more than just a clever title .
the interior of the store is actually built to resemble a bavarian village square , with stalls decorated as typical snow-covered , half-timbered houses surrounding a 16-foot-tall christmas tree .
stars twinkle overhead as visitors stroll cobblestone “ streets . ”
a 12-foot-tall nutcracker-soldier stands guard at the doorway to the village , an acquiescent photo-op companion for any and all . in its quaintness , the christmas village -lrb- decorated with more than three miles of christmas garland and over 80,000 artificial lights -rrb- offers up heavy competition to the astonishingly preserved medieval town of rothenburg ob der tauber , itself one of germany ’ s top tourist destinations . a hand-crafted music box in some parts of the world , of course , a shop dedicated to selling christmas wares year round may seem old hat .
-lrb- in the united states , for example , such stores have been around for a good two decades . -rrb-
but in germany , where traditions run deep , christmas decorations are on the shelves from late november until dec .
24 , and as a rule can not be had again until the following year . this was the situation in the early 1960s , when the wohlfahrt family was celebrating christmas with american military friends .
the americans fell in love with one of the wohlfaharts ’ own beloved family keepsakes , a hand crafted christmas music boxes from the harz mountains .
asking around , the wohlfahrts were told it would be impossible to get another one until the following spring , and then they would have to buy at least ten of them . the japan connection they bought it , eventually gave the gift , and sold the rest to american soldiers ’ families stationed nearby .
thus the year-round christmas village concept was born . now , clients come not just from america , but from around the world .
they snatch up the company 's hallmark decorations to the tune of close to € 20 million a year . ironically , many of the wohlfahrt ’ s clients are japanese , despite the fact that the overwhelmingly buddhist and shintoist country doesn ’ t celebrate christmas as it is known in the west .
but as with other western traditions , christmas decoration is beginning to seep into the asian culture . emi kanazawa , a japanese who lives in germany , works at wohlfahrt , mostly serving japanese customers .
in japan , she says , “ -lrb- dec .
24 -rrb- is a normal workday .
only some families with small children celebrate at home , make a good meal and the kids get presents . ” adds company spokeswoman felicitas höpner : “ the japanese come to rothenburg because they find the medieval village typically german .
they come to the christmas village because they like to decorate .
they see that in germany people decorate for christmas , that it ’ s special . ” she notes that the japanese clients are especially drawn to wohlfahrt ’ s hand-painted wooden articles due to the quality of craftsmanship – a point of pride with the 200 person , family-run company .
wohlfart has its own design workshop , where everything from rosy-cheeked wooden incense-burning santas known as “ knoddeln ” to limited-edition porcelain angels is designed .
thereafter , “ the production is given over to traditional craft-making firms throughout germany , ” höpner explains . mom-and-pop empire “ made in germany ” is an important phrase for the wohlfahrt company : “ quality for us means that our products are … made by german companies .
we control to make sure the craftsmanship is first class … for example , the painting should be right there where it belongs - not like in many things that are made cheaply in the far east , where one eyebrow is a half a millimeter higher than the other . ” despite its tradition , wohlfahrt ’ s is anything but your typical mom-and-pop store - more like an empire .
a brief look at their web site -lrb- you can also order from an online catalog -rrb- shows that wohlfahrt runs seven stores in rothenburg alone , all honing in on a slightly different segment of the souvenir market .
there are six more stores in germany , located in tourism hot spots such as oberammergau , garmisch partenkirchen , heidelberg - and christmas über-mecca nüremberg . and the company has reached further afield , to quaint tourist towns in riquewihr -lrb- alsace -rrb- , france , and bruges , belgium , as well as making an appearance at the christmas markets this year in florence , italy , and osaka and sapporo , japan . its popularity world-wide notwithstanding , it seems wohlfahrt hasn ’ t forgotten its roots or the first music boxes it sold to american military families .

hundreds of german peacekeepers stationed in afghanistan are gearing up for a christmas far away from home and family .
but they 're pulling out all the stops and celebrating with christmas trees , gifts and mass . amidst the dry desert landscape of afghanistan and several thousand miles away from home and loved ones , over 2,000 german soldiers working to keep the peace are preparing to take a break from their security duties and celebrate christmas .
the military headquarters of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the capital of kabul is beginning to resemble a german town just before the festive season .

thereafter , “ the production is given over to traditional craft-making firms throughout germany , ” höpner explains . mom-and-pop empire “ made in germany ” is an important phrase for the wohlfahrt company : “ quality for us means that our products are … made by german companies .
we control to make sure the craftsmanship is first class … for example , the painting should be right there where it belongs - not like in many things that are made cheaply in the far east , where one eyebrow is a half a millimeter higher than the other . ” despite its tradition , wohlfahrt ’ s is anything but your typical mom-and-pop store - more like an empire .
a brief look at their web site -lrb- you can also order from an online catalog -rrb- shows that wohlfahrt runs seven stores in rothenburg alone , all honing in on a slightly different segment of the souvenir market .
there are six more stores in germany , located in tourism hot spots such as oberammergau , garmisch partenkirchen , heidelberg - and christmas über-mecca nüremberg . and the company has reached further afield , to quaint tourist towns in riquewihr -lrb- alsace -rrb- , france , and bruges , belgium , as well as making an appearance at the christmas markets this year in florence , italy , and osaka and sapporo , japan . its popularity world-wide notwithstanding , it seems wohlfahrt hasn ’ t forgotten its roots or the first music boxes it sold to american military families .

24 , and as a rule can not be had again until the following year . this was the situation in the early 1960s , when the wohlfahrt family was celebrating christmas with american military friends .
the americans fell in love with one of the wohlfaharts ’ own beloved family keepsakes , a hand crafted christmas music boxes from the harz mountains .
asking around , the wohlfahrts were told it would be impossible to get another one until the following spring , and then they would have to buy at least ten of them . the japan connection they bought it , eventually gave the gift , and sold the rest to american soldiers ’ families stationed nearby .
thus the year-round christmas village concept was born . now , clients come not just from america , but from around the world .
they snatch up the company 's hallmark decorations to the tune of close to € 20 million a year . ironically , many of the wohlfahrt ’ s clients are japanese , despite the fact that the overwhelmingly buddhist and shintoist country doesn ’ t celebrate christmas as it is known in the west .

hundreds of german peacekeepers stationed in afghanistan are gearing up for a christmas far away from home and family .
but they 're pulling out all the stops and celebrating with christmas trees , gifts and mass . amidst the dry desert landscape of afghanistan and several thousand miles away from home and loved ones , over 2,000 german soldiers working to keep the peace are preparing to take a break from their security duties and celebrate christmas .
the military headquarters of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the capital of kabul is beginning to resemble a german town just before the festive season .
the smell of traditional baking wafts out from the special christmas market erected for the troops , a stuffed elk surfs on a green snowboard to the beat of the music on a christmas store counter , the dining room is aglow with colorful lights , homemade cookies are piled high on the tables and candles and wreaths decorate most of the usually plain rooms .
even the first pine trees have finally arrived , flown in all the way from germany .
vital link to home the post office at isaf headquarters has witnessed hectic activity since early december .
more than five tons of letters and packages have already been sent back and forth between germany and afghanistan .
post office worker burkhard opitz said that early planning was a must for soldiers who wanted their packages to reach home in time to be put under the christmas tree on dec .

" a slice of home " for the two german military priests based in afghanistan , christmas eve is expected to bring a whole load of work .
they are scheduled to hold services in the base camp , the isaf headquarters as well as for the soldiers , who are stationed at the kabul airport .
protestant priest jens hausschild said he expected huge crowds to attend the mass in the base camp .
" after all it ’ s no normal sunday , but christmas eve .
that ’ s why we ’ re going to be celebrating in our auditorium , an event tent formerly used as a fitness studio and cinema hall .
lots of people can fit in there . "
hausschild ’ s catholic colleague , joseph gertz , added , " we ’ re going to celebrate mass in the same way that we do at home .
i think it ’ s important because it ’ s a slice of home . "
song and food in keeping with efforts to recreate a normal christmas , the priests have also organized a christmas choir .
for weeks , 14 soldiers have been training their vocal chords to belt out one christmas song after the other under the guidance of gertz , who is also the choir director .
and much like christmas the world over , food will form the centerpiece of the festivities at the isaf headquarters .
soldiers at the camp have long been earnestly speculating on the finer details of the christmas spread .
one of the soldiers was hardly able to contain his enthusiasm .

the military headquarters of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the capital of kabul is beginning to resemble a german town just before the festive season .
the smell of traditional baking wafts out from the special christmas market erected for the troops , a stuffed elk surfs on a green snowboard to the beat of the music on a christmas store counter , the dining room is aglow with colorful lights , homemade cookies are piled high on the tables and candles and wreaths decorate most of the usually plain rooms .
even the first pine trees have finally arrived , flown in all the way from germany .
vital link to home the post office at isaf headquarters has witnessed hectic activity since early december .
more than five tons of letters and packages have already been sent back and forth between germany and afghanistan .
post office worker burkhard opitz said that early planning was a must for soldiers who wanted their packages to reach home in time to be put under the christmas tree on dec .

we had a dec .

" a slice of home " for the two german military priests based in afghanistan , christmas eve is expected to bring a whole load of work .
they are scheduled to hold services in the base camp , the isaf headquarters as well as for the soldiers , who are stationed at the kabul airport .
protestant priest jens hausschild said he expected huge crowds to attend the mass in the base camp .
" after all it ’ s no normal sunday , but christmas eve .
that ’ s why we ’ re going to be celebrating in our auditorium , an event tent formerly used as a fitness studio and cinema hall .
lots of people can fit in there . "
hausschild ’ s catholic colleague , joseph gertz , added , " we ’ re going to celebrate mass in the same way that we do at home .
i think it ’ s important because it ’ s a slice of home . "
song and food in keeping with efforts to recreate a normal christmas , the priests have also organized a christmas choir .
for weeks , 14 soldiers have been training their vocal chords to belt out one christmas song after the other under the guidance of gertz , who is also the choir director .
and much like christmas the world over , food will form the centerpiece of the festivities at the isaf headquarters .
soldiers at the camp have long been earnestly speculating on the finer details of the christmas spread .
one of the soldiers was hardly able to contain his enthusiasm .

they come from as nearby as switzerland , as far away as japan .
they are lovers of christmas decoration as only the germans can do it : nutcracker-soldiers and music boxes , hanging glass ornaments and nativity figures , all of it handmade and hand-painted . they come looking for their mecca , and they find it , open 12 months each year : käthe wohlfahrt ’ s christmas village . the name christmas village is more than just a clever title .
the interior of the store is actually built to resemble a bavarian village square , with stalls decorated as typical snow-covered , half-timbered houses surrounding a 16-foot-tall christmas tree .
stars twinkle overhead as visitors stroll cobblestone “ streets . ”
a 12-foot-tall nutcracker-soldier stands guard at the doorway to the village , an acquiescent photo-op companion for any and all . in its quaintness , the christmas village -lrb- decorated with more than three miles of christmas garland and over 80,000 artificial lights -rrb- offers up heavy competition to the astonishingly preserved medieval town of rothenburg ob der tauber , itself one of germany ’ s top tourist destinations . a hand-crafted music box in some parts of the world , of course , a shop dedicated to selling christmas wares year round may seem old hat .
-lrb- in the united states , for example , such stores have been around for a good two decades . -rrb-
but in germany , where traditions run deep , christmas decorations are on the shelves from late november until dec .
24 , and as a rule can not be had again until the following year . this was the situation in the early 1960s , when the wohlfahrt family was celebrating christmas with american military friends .
the americans fell in love with one of the wohlfaharts ’ own beloved family keepsakes , a hand crafted christmas music boxes from the harz mountains .
asking around , the wohlfahrts were told it would be impossible to get another one until the following spring , and then they would have to buy at least ten of them . the japan connection they bought it , eventually gave the gift , and sold the rest to american soldiers ’ families stationed nearby .
thus the year-round christmas village concept was born . now , clients come not just from america , but from around the world .
they snatch up the company 's hallmark decorations to the tune of close to € 20 million a year . ironically , many of the wohlfahrt ’ s clients are japanese , despite the fact that the overwhelmingly buddhist and shintoist country doesn ’ t celebrate christmas as it is known in the west .
but as with other western traditions , christmas decoration is beginning to seep into the asian culture . emi kanazawa , a japanese who lives in germany , works at wohlfahrt , mostly serving japanese customers .
in japan , she says , “ -lrb- dec .
24 -rrb- is a normal workday .
only some families with small children celebrate at home , make a good meal and the kids get presents . ” adds company spokeswoman felicitas höpner : “ the japanese come to rothenburg because they find the medieval village typically german .
they come to the christmas village because they like to decorate .
they see that in germany people decorate for christmas , that it ’ s special . ” she notes that the japanese clients are especially drawn to wohlfahrt ’ s hand-painted wooden articles due to the quality of craftsmanship – a point of pride with the 200 person , family-run company .
wohlfart has its own design workshop , where everything from rosy-cheeked wooden incense-burning santas known as “ knoddeln ” to limited-edition porcelain angels is designed .
thereafter , “ the production is given over to traditional craft-making firms throughout germany , ” höpner explains . mom-and-pop empire “ made in germany ” is an important phrase for the wohlfahrt company : “ quality for us means that our products are … made by german companies .
we control to make sure the craftsmanship is first class … for example , the painting should be right there where it belongs - not like in many things that are made cheaply in the far east , where one eyebrow is a half a millimeter higher than the other . ” despite its tradition , wohlfahrt ’ s is anything but your typical mom-and-pop store - more like an empire .
a brief look at their web site -lrb- you can also order from an online catalog -rrb- shows that wohlfahrt runs seven stores in rothenburg alone , all honing in on a slightly different segment of the souvenir market .
there are six more stores in germany , located in tourism hot spots such as oberammergau , garmisch partenkirchen , heidelberg - and christmas über-mecca nüremberg . and the company has reached further afield , to quaint tourist towns in riquewihr -lrb- alsace -rrb- , france , and bruges , belgium , as well as making an appearance at the christmas markets this year in florence , italy , and osaka and sapporo , japan . its popularity world-wide notwithstanding , it seems wohlfahrt hasn ’ t forgotten its roots or the first music boxes it sold to american military families .
in 2001 , the company opened its first store in the u.s. , located in stillwater , minnesota .
and holders of military id cards can get wohlfart goods at four military-base stores in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg , city of angels in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .

eichel told the mass circulation newspaper bild , " we want to reform the tax system .
we can come to a quick agreement with the union – i ’ m sure of that . "
csu leader stoiber agreed .
" next year we have to disentangle the mired tax system under the motto less taxes and fewer expenditures .
other countries have long had a clear-cut , simple system with low tax brackets .

they come from as nearby as switzerland , as far away as japan .
they are lovers of christmas decoration as only the germans can do it : nutcracker-soldiers and music boxes , hanging glass ornaments and nativity figures , all of it handmade and hand-painted . they come looking for their mecca , and they find it , open 12 months each year : käthe wohlfahrt ’ s christmas village . the name christmas village is more than just a clever title .
the interior of the store is actually built to resemble a bavarian village square , with stalls decorated as typical snow-covered , half-timbered houses surrounding a 16-foot-tall christmas tree .
stars twinkle overhead as visitors stroll cobblestone “ streets . ”
a 12-foot-tall nutcracker-soldier stands guard at the doorway to the village , an acquiescent photo-op companion for any and all . in its quaintness , the christmas village -lrb- decorated with more than three miles of christmas garland and over 80,000 artificial lights -rrb- offers up heavy competition to the astonishingly preserved medieval town of rothenburg ob der tauber , itself one of germany ’ s top tourist destinations . a hand-crafted music box in some parts of the world , of course , a shop dedicated to selling christmas wares year round may seem old hat .
-lrb- in the united states , for example , such stores have been around for a good two decades . -rrb-
but in germany , where traditions run deep , christmas decorations are on the shelves from late november until dec .
24 , and as a rule can not be had again until the following year . this was the situation in the early 1960s , when the wohlfahrt family was celebrating christmas with american military friends .
the americans fell in love with one of the wohlfaharts ’ own beloved family keepsakes , a hand crafted christmas music boxes from the harz mountains .
asking around , the wohlfahrts were told it would be impossible to get another one until the following spring , and then they would have to buy at least ten of them . the japan connection they bought it , eventually gave the gift , and sold the rest to american soldiers ’ families stationed nearby .
thus the year-round christmas village concept was born . now , clients come not just from america , but from around the world .
they snatch up the company 's hallmark decorations to the tune of close to € 20 million a year . ironically , many of the wohlfahrt ’ s clients are japanese , despite the fact that the overwhelmingly buddhist and shintoist country doesn ’ t celebrate christmas as it is known in the west .
but as with other western traditions , christmas decoration is beginning to seep into the asian culture . emi kanazawa , a japanese who lives in germany , works at wohlfahrt , mostly serving japanese customers .
in japan , she says , “ -lrb- dec .
24 -rrb- is a normal workday .
only some families with small children celebrate at home , make a good meal and the kids get presents . ” adds company spokeswoman felicitas höpner : “ the japanese come to rothenburg because they find the medieval village typically german .
they come to the christmas village because they like to decorate .
they see that in germany people decorate for christmas , that it ’ s special . ” she notes that the japanese clients are especially drawn to wohlfahrt ’ s hand-painted wooden articles due to the quality of craftsmanship – a point of pride with the 200 person , family-run company .
wohlfart has its own design workshop , where everything from rosy-cheeked wooden incense-burning santas known as “ knoddeln ” to limited-edition porcelain angels is designed .
thereafter , “ the production is given over to traditional craft-making firms throughout germany , ” höpner explains . mom-and-pop empire “ made in germany ” is an important phrase for the wohlfahrt company : “ quality for us means that our products are … made by german companies .
we control to make sure the craftsmanship is first class … for example , the painting should be right there where it belongs - not like in many things that are made cheaply in the far east , where one eyebrow is a half a millimeter higher than the other . ” despite its tradition , wohlfahrt ’ s is anything but your typical mom-and-pop store - more like an empire .
a brief look at their web site -lrb- you can also order from an online catalog -rrb- shows that wohlfahrt runs seven stores in rothenburg alone , all honing in on a slightly different segment of the souvenir market .
there are six more stores in germany , located in tourism hot spots such as oberammergau , garmisch partenkirchen , heidelberg - and christmas über-mecca nüremberg . and the company has reached further afield , to quaint tourist towns in riquewihr -lrb- alsace -rrb- , france , and bruges , belgium , as well as making an appearance at the christmas markets this year in florence , italy , and osaka and sapporo , japan . its popularity world-wide notwithstanding , it seems wohlfahrt hasn ’ t forgotten its roots or the first music boxes it sold to american military families .
in 2001 , the company opened its first store in the u.s. , located in stillwater , minnesota .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2003 christmas in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may not have the nuremburg christmas market , but soldiers in kabul will have plenty of holiday treats this year .
hundreds of german peacekeepers stationed in afghanistan are gearing up for a christmas far away from home and family .
but they 're pulling out all the stops and celebrating with christmas trees , gifts and mass . amidst the dry desert landscape of afghanistan and several thousand miles away from home and loved ones , over 2,000 german soldiers working to keep the peace are preparing to take a break from their security duties and celebrate christmas .
the military headquarters of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the capital of kabul is beginning to resemble a german town just before the festive season .
the smell of traditional baking wafts out from the special christmas market erected for the troops , a stuffed elk surfs on a green snowboard to the beat of the music on a christmas store counter , the dining room is aglow with colorful lights , homemade cookies are piled high on the tables and candles and wreaths decorate most of the usually plain rooms .
even the first pine trees have finally arrived , flown in all the way from germany .
vital link to home the post office at isaf headquarters has witnessed hectic activity since early december .
more than five tons of letters and packages have already been sent back and forth between germany and afghanistan .
post office worker burkhard opitz said that early planning was a must for soldiers who wanted their packages to reach home in time to be put under the christmas tree on dec .
24 .
" here the christmas traffic had to be pulled forward because of all the flying , since it all also depends on the weather .
we had a dec .
5 deadline , which means it ’ s better to play safe because all the mail has to go through customs in speyer , germany , " he explained .
" a slice of home " for the two german military priests based in afghanistan , christmas eve is expected to bring a whole load of work .
they are scheduled to hold services in the base camp , the isaf headquarters as well as for the soldiers , who are stationed at the kabul airport .
protestant priest jens hausschild said he expected huge crowds to attend the mass in the base camp .
" after all it ’ s no normal sunday , but christmas eve .
that ’ s why we ’ re going to be celebrating in our auditorium , an event tent formerly used as a fitness studio and cinema hall .
lots of people can fit in there . "
hausschild ’ s catholic colleague , joseph gertz , added , " we ’ re going to celebrate mass in the same way that we do at home .
i think it ’ s important because it ’ s a slice of home . "
song and food in keeping with efforts to recreate a normal christmas , the priests have also organized a christmas choir .
for weeks , 14 soldiers have been training their vocal chords to belt out one christmas song after the other under the guidance of gertz , who is also the choir director .
and much like christmas the world over , food will form the centerpiece of the festivities at the isaf headquarters .
soldiers at the camp have long been earnestly speculating on the finer details of the christmas spread .
one of the soldiers was hardly able to contain his enthusiasm .
" there ’ s a plan and if we stick to it .
we ’ re going to get something delicious to eat .
i think there ’ s going to be goose .
and since we ’ re multinational , there will also be specialties from england , america , canada .

hundreds of german peacekeepers stationed in afghanistan are gearing up for a christmas far away from home and family .
but they 're pulling out all the stops and celebrating with christmas trees , gifts and mass . amidst the dry desert landscape of afghanistan and several thousand miles away from home and loved ones , over 2,000 german soldiers working to keep the peace are preparing to take a break from their security duties and celebrate christmas .
the military headquarters of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the capital of kabul is beginning to resemble a german town just before the festive season .
the smell of traditional baking wafts out from the special christmas market erected for the troops , a stuffed elk surfs on a green snowboard to the beat of the music on a christmas store counter , the dining room is aglow with colorful lights , homemade cookies are piled high on the tables and candles and wreaths decorate most of the usually plain rooms .

" a slice of home " for the two german military priests based in afghanistan , christmas eve is expected to bring a whole load of work .
they are scheduled to hold services in the base camp , the isaf headquarters as well as for the soldiers , who are stationed at the kabul airport .
protestant priest jens hausschild said he expected huge crowds to attend the mass in the base camp .
" after all it ’ s no normal sunday , but christmas eve .
that ’ s why we ’ re going to be celebrating in our auditorium , an event tent formerly used as a fitness studio and cinema hall .
lots of people can fit in there . "
hausschild ’ s catholic colleague , joseph gertz , added , " we ’ re going to celebrate mass in the same way that we do at home .
i think it ’ s important because it ’ s a slice of home . "
song and food in keeping with efforts to recreate a normal christmas , the priests have also organized a christmas choir .
for weeks , 14 soldiers have been training their vocal chords to belt out one christmas song after the other under the guidance of gertz , who is also the choir director .
and much like christmas the world over , food will form the centerpiece of the festivities at the isaf headquarters .
soldiers at the camp have long been earnestly speculating on the finer details of the christmas spread .
one of the soldiers was hardly able to contain his enthusiasm .
" there ’ s a plan and if we stick to it .
we ’ re going to get something delicious to eat .

at least 18 are in hospital , some vowing to starve themselves to death if the australian government continues to reject their claims for asylum .
the action began two weeks ago when some protesters sewed up their lips .
immigration minister amanda vanstone said the decision not to grant them visas would not be reversed .
doctors on nauru have said medical services on the island are being stretched to the limit as the hunger strike enters a third week .
senior staff have expressed fears that detainees could die if a solution is not found soon .
a delegation sent by the government to assess the health and mood of the protesters has reported back to the immigration minister .
it appears both sides are refusing to budge .
war of wills amanda vanstone has been told the men are determined to continue refusing food .
the authorities in canberra have again insisted they have no intention of bowing to any pressure .
forty-one men , mostly afghans , are taking part in the hunger strike .
their claims for asylum have been rejected and they have been offered a repatriation package .
the detainees have insisted they will face persecution if they are sent home .
afghanistan 's ambassador to australia , mahmoud saikal , has urged canberra to give the 284 boat people on nauru temporary asylum until his country 's economy is strong enough to re-integrate them .
newspaper reports here suggest new zealand is considering offering sanctuary to some of the detainees .
amanda vanstone 's response has been typically blunt .
australia 's immigration minister said if the international community was unhappy with the situation on nauru it was welcome to accept any of the asylum seekers .

agriculture secretary ann veneman said a holstein cow had tested positive - but she insisted us beef was safe .
in response , a number of countries in asia , including america 's biggest importer , japan , have moved swiftly to ban us beef .
bse has been linked to new variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease -lrb- vcjd -rrb- , a human brain-wasting disease .
the diseased cow was tested for bse on 9 december and a tissue sample was being flown by military jet to the uk for further tests .
bovine spongiform encephalopathy first surfaced mid-1980s can pass to humans through infected beef products human form of disease called vcjd vcjd has killed 137 people , mainly in the uk department of agriculture statement us beef ban the results will take a few days to come through .
the farm near yakima , washington , where the cow was found has been quarantined .
" we remain confident in the safety of our food supply , " ms veneman told reporters - adding that she planned to serve beef on christmas day .
the dairy cow had been sick or injured and was never destined for the public food supply , ms veneman said .
in tokyo , japanese agriculture ministry spokesman hiroaki ogura said a ban on us beef products took effect immediately , until further information could be gathered .
south korea - another key us market - followed suit , halting customs inspection of us beef and effectively blocking its entry into the country 's markets .
the bbc 's michael buchanan in washington says while that will concern exporters , the real harm could come if american consumers stop eating beef and deal a potentially devastating blow to the $ 175bn us cattle industry .
canada , the third biggest foreign market for us beef , said it would wait for confirmation on the test results before taking any action .
countries that have banned us beef japan south korea singapore taiwan malaysia thailand hong kong in august , the us eased a ban on canadian beef imports after a single case of the disease was found at a farm in alberta in may .
the two cases do not appear to be connected .
a private study released in november estimated that canada 's beef industry lost $ 2.5bn -lrb- c $ 3.3bn -rrb- in the six months after its mad cow case was discovered .
first diagnosed in britain in 1986 , bse -lrb- bovine spongiform encephalopathy -rrb- affected 178,000 british cattle and resulted in the eventual destruction of 3.7 million animals .
it cost british farming billions of dollars as countries around the world banned british beef .
' abundance of caution ' but ms veneman insisted that since 1990 , steps had been taken in the us to ensure there could be no similar spread of the disease through american herds .

hong kong source : us meat export federation " even though the risk to human health is minimal , we will take all appropriate actions out of an abundance of caution , " she said .
correspondents say the us beef business is booming - partly due to the popularity of the protein-rich atkins diet .
the agriculture minister said she was working with the department of homeland security to assure the public that the suspected case was not terrorist related , or connected with the current terrorism alert in the us .
most of the beef raised in the united states is consumed by the domestic market , with 10 % exported to foreign markets , according to the us department of agriculture .

" the us embassy in manama encourages all american citizens to avoid places where westerners are known to congregate and to reduce unnecessary travel .

michael connarty has criticised the home office over the detention of children at the dungavel centre .
the centre in lanarkshire houses failed asylum seekers and their families before they are deported .
the mp for falkirk east said the government risked being seen as " xenophobic " because of its policies .
the home office , which is responsible for immigration policy , has repeatedly rejected calls to end the detention of asylum seekers ' children . "
i believe it 's encouraging people to think that any parties that are anti-immigrant are parties that they can trust " michael connarty falkirk east mp mr connarty told the bbc 's good morning scotland that he believed there were " serious problems " within the home office .
" i think they think they are tackling the perception that they are soft on asylum seekers , by being hard on those who are the weakest , " he said .
" i really worry that if we keep fanning this flame what we are actually going to fan is not a sense that labour are tough because i notice that all the political parties , shamefully the tories and snp are trying to make political capital out of it .
" but really what we are doing is fanning the flame where people think that being anti-immigrant , anti-asylum seeker is a good thing and what we are generating is , aside from xenophobia ... and actually we are fanning the flame of the british national party if we keep doing this . "
hostel proposal speaking later , mr connarty added : " i believe it 's encouraging people to think that any parties that are anti-immigrant are parties that they can trust . "
the mp is involved in a campaign by churches in scotland to stop the detention of children at dungavel .
they have put forward a proposal which would allow children to be released after five days into hostel-type accommodation . "
these children have committed no offence but just have the misfortune to be asylum seekers " ronnie smith eis whilst maintaining its stance , the home office has announced a series of measures to ensure the welfare of children at dungavel .
these include the need for a government minister to give express authority before a child can be detained for longer than 28 days .
the educational and welfare needs of any child being kept there for more than three weeks will also be assessed to make sure they are being met .
teachers ' union call scotland 's largest teachers ' union , the eis , are demanding an end to the detention of children at dungavel .
the union said the practice of locking up innocent children with their families was a " mark of shame " on scotland .
eis general secretary ronnie smith said : " these children have committed no offence but just have the misfortune to be asylum seekers .
" it is unacceptable that children should be imprisoned in any circumstance .
" they 've been denied access to the education available to other youngsters and barred from the opportunity to socialise and mix . "
a home office spokesman responded : " it is clearly very regrettable that some families with children have to be detained .
it is not a decision we take lightly .
" obviously it is not ideal for any child to be detained .
it happens in only a small number of cases for the minimum amount of time . "
on tuesday , home office minister beverley hughes revealed that dungavel is to be expanded to house more asylum seekers and their families .
the proposals will increase dungavel 's capacity by 25 % with the construction of a new 44-bed unit on the site .
the new block will cost £ 3m and consist of pre-fabricated buildings with bars on the windows .
the centre currently holds 150 men , women and children .

the home office , which is responsible for immigration policy , has repeatedly rejected calls to end the detention of asylum seekers ' children .

these children have committed no offence but just have the misfortune to be asylum seekers ronnie smith eis whilst maintaining its stance , the home office has announced a series of measures to ensure the welfare of children at dungavel .
these include the need for a government minister to give express authority before a child can be detained for longer than 28 days .
the educational and welfare needs of any child being kept there for more than three weeks will also be assessed to make sure they are being met .
teachers ' union call scotland 's largest teachers ' union , the eis , are demanding an end to the detention of children at dungavel .
the union said the practice of locking up innocent children with their families was a " mark of shame " on scotland .

the centre was a prison before housing asylum seekers " it is unacceptable that children should be imprisoned in any circumstance .
" they 've been denied access to the education available to other youngsters and barred from the opportunity to socialise and mix . "
a home office spokesman responded : " it is clearly very regrettable that some families with children have to be detained .
it is not a decision we take lightly .
" obviously it is not ideal for any child to be detained .
it happens in only a small number of cases for the minimum amount of time . "

miguel and gilberto rodriguez orejuela ran the cali cartel , which dominated the world 's cocaine trade in the 1990s .
the extradition order alleges they have continued to run their empire from their prison cells in colombia , where they have been confined since 1995 .
president alvaro uribe is expected to authorise the request , which must also go through the supreme court .
the rodriguez orejuela brothers are charged with smuggling 55 tonnes of cocaine , laundering about $ 2bn and silencing those who might testify against them , either through bribery or by murder .
the us indictment alleges the brothers ran the cartel through miguel rodriguez orejuela 's son william rodriguez abadia the colombian government is trying to eradicate drug crops if the request goes ahead , the brothers would become the highest-profile drug lords to be sent to the us to face justice since colombia lifted a ban on extradition in 1997 .
president uribe has stepped up the pace of extradition of drug smugglers to the us , where they face tougher jail sentences than in colombia .
' the chess player ' gilberto rodriguez orejuela , known in the drugs underworld as " the chess player " for his ability to outwit opponents , was released from prison last year for good behaviour .
he had served a seven-year sentence .
but he was re-arrested on an order from the president that he be put back " behind bars " .
he was subsequently convicted of being involved in the smuggling of 150 kilograms of cocaine to the us via costa rica in 1995 .
the recapture of gilberto rodriguez orejuela was welcomed by the us , which long pushed for the brothers to be extradited .
however , many of the crimes that the us charging the brothers with pre-dated the 1997 order by the colombian government to reintroduce extradition .
the rodriguez orejuela brothers are thought to have once controlled 80 % of the world 's supply of cocaine in the early 1990s .
they obtained the monopoly of the multi-billion dollar industry after rival drug lord pablo escobar was killed by police in 1993 .
escobar had run the medellin cocaine cartel .
