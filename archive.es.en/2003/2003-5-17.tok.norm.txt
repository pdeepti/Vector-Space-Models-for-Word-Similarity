all the briefs for wednesday 's clash between celtic and porto in seville have already been sold .
but strathclyde police said that due to the huge interest , police in scotland and spain are watching out for forgeries .
the force has revealed that intelligence information suggested that a number of good quality forgeries were in circulation .
superintendent tim love , who has been liaising with seville , said : " tight security is in place and the stadium has advanced technology which can detect if the ticket is authentic .
" there is every likelihood that the spanish police may arrest people if they have a forged ticket . "
a spokeswoman for celtic football club said : " clearly , we realise that many supporters are holidaying in the area and indeed many supporters will have travelled to spain without a ticket .
celtic shops have seen bumper trade " however , we would certainly urge supporters not travel to the estadio olimpico without a ticket . "
back in glasgow , however , police licensing chiefs were also reminding people that the usual drinking by-laws still apply .
meanwhile , more than 35,000 new celtic strips have been sold ahead of the cup final .
celtic store merchandising manager kevin cawley said : " i 've been working here for over seven years and have never seen anything like it .
" we estimate by the end of this week , jersey sales will have topped 45,000 - that 's four or five times the previous record sale for the first week of a strip launch . "
