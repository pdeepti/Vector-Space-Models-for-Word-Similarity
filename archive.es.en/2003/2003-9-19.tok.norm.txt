the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2003 beer frenzy in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prost !
visitors to the oktoberfest drink an average 5 liters of beer beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
one of these , and probably the most significant , is the annual oktoberfest .
the festival , which traditionally begins on the 21st of september , attracts more than six million visitors each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waitresses in the traditional bavarian " dirndl " swing their mugs and dance among the crowd .
it is said to be the largest public bash in the world .
in just 14 days , visitors consume more than five million liters of beer and up to 200,000 pork sausages .
an impressive 14 specially constructed giant " beer tents " with room for an average 7,000 drinkers are put up by munich 's breweries for the event , which begins when the first keg is tapped in the so-called schottenhammel tent .
a long-time tradition , the mayor personally ' taps ' the first barrel of beer and shouts " o 'zapft is ! " -lrb- the keg is tapped -rrb- .
then the festivities begin . dancing on tables bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer mugs on a table in a beer tent at the oktoberfest in munich , bavaria .
with the keg tapping over , the ' fest ' can begin .
as the beer flows freely and long trestle tables groan under the weight of the huge , heavy one-liter mugs and impromptu dancing begins on slippery table tops , dedicated oktoberfest fans start setting up camp on the surrounding fields .
for many , the festivity lasts for several days , beginning when the first tents open at ten , until long into the cool , late summer night . despite its name , the oktoberfest actually kicks off in september , since the chances of the weather cooperating are greater .
the reasons for the festival 's name lie in its origins .
it all began with the celebrated marriage on october 12 , 1810 of the bavarian crown prince ludwig -lrb- later known as ludwig the first -rrb- to princess therese from the german kingdom of saxony-hildburghausen , who gave her name to the theresienwiese , where the oktoberfest takes place .
after such a successful party , it was decided that the celebrations should take place every year . less visitors , more fun ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer mug full of euros - the oktoberfest is a major money-making event in munich .
today , visitor numbers are declining but oktoberfest is still a major event on the german calendar .
not just in a cultural sense : an average € 1 billion rolls into the registers of breweries , taxis and hotels during the two weeks of the festival .
however , competition is growing .
already , there is a smaller , yet just as beery oktoberfest which takes place at the same time in berlin .
and this year , londoners do n't need to go far to get a taste of their favorite bavarian brew : instead , they can stay at home and enjoy their first , very own london-based bavarian-style beer ' fest ' . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2003 golf in germany means much more than vw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when most people talk about golf in germany , they 're referring to the car and not the sport .
as the german open golf championship continues in glorious cologne sunshine , the inquisitive observer may look on with bemusement .
golf in germany ?
surely you mean the car … when asked a question that involves the words “ germany ” and “ golf ” , most people outside the country itself will automatically think of the popular volkswagen hatchback .
those with a little more knowledge of the sport which shares the same name as vw ’ s flagship motor may be able to combine the two terms and come up with the name of bernhard langer , germany ’ s double u.s. masters winner and golfing hall of fame resident .
few would be able to name a major golfing event which takes place in germany . however , germany plays home to one of the european tour ’ s main events once a season when the top players in the game come to gut lärchenhof near cologne to contest for prize money that totals € 3 million .
and this year , more people are likely to get to hear about it as the championship has already seen a european record after just one round of play . record breaking first day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard langer .
the 28-year-old swede fredrik jacobson wrote his name into the annals of european tour history on thursday when he completed his day ’ s work twelve shots under the recommended number players should take to get round the course .
jacobson ’ s 12 under par gave him the lead in the linde german masters but also made him only one of 10 players ever to complete a course in 60 shots on a european tour event . he very nearly broke all records when he arrived at his final challenge of the first day , the ninth hole , needing to complete the hole in one shot less than the par to record a round of 59 .
unfortunately , it was not to be and the swede equalled the european record instead of beating it . such feats may tweak the interest of the foreign enthusiast in the direction of germany for the duration of the tournament which ends on september 21 , but for the local golf fan , it is just one of the attractions of a sport that is growing in popularity across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay and play or ride all day .
before bernhard langer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- success , there was n't much interest in golf in germany . now , however , the construction of over 100 new courses is a strong indication that the germans have taken a liking to the sport . the numbers of official golf clubs is on the rise , increasing three-fold since 1987 according to the german golf association .
germany ’ s official golf body boasts 622 clubs and 13 federal associations , and boasts more than 350,000 members . serious money members of association clubs usually have to possess a license called a platzreife which is awarded to a player who has taken a five-day course that involves several hours of training each day and a series of written and practical tests for the price of around € 300 . the platzreife is actually a legal requirement to play golf in registered clubs in germany , instituted over 40 years ago .
no other country in europe requires such a license , but german golfing associations say it is necessary to prevent unskilled players from holding up the games of others . however , there are other ways .
some german courses are semi-private , meaning visitors are welcome , although usually only monday through thursday and will cost the visitor € 60 for the privilege .
some other clubs cost somewhat less to play . # b # the cheaper priced courses reflect the fact that most german clubs still expect their golfers to walk with only a few of the bigger clubs providing motorized carts at prices that include their hire . tournaments for all for the adventurous golfer in germany , or the confident one , many german clubs offer the opportunity to take part in open tournaments to players outside their membership .
these tournaments are recommended to those who intend to spend the whole day at the club teeing off and putting away happily as they tend to be the same price or less than a usual day pass and include a meal , such as an awards dinner where formal attire is insisted upon . typical to the national mentality , the germans have taken to golf in a very technical way , focussing on the skill aspects of golf and spending a lot of time taking lessons and practicing , both on the range and on the course .
this has permeated into their well regimented and valued leisure time with a booming trade in hotels combining well-earned breaks with course passes becoming a country-wide phenomenon . so in germany , the old adage that , for many , golf is a pleasant walk spoiled could not be further from the truth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hosts most sporting events germany may not have the olympics and it may still have to wait a few years before hosting the world cup , but it 's ranked number one in the number of sporting events .

golf in germany ?
surely you mean the car … when asked a question that involves the words “ germany ” and “ golf ” , most people outside the country itself will automatically think of the popular volkswagen hatchback .
those with a little more knowledge of the sport which shares the same name as vw ’ s flagship motor may be able to combine the two terms and come up with the name of bernhard langer , germany ’ s double u.s. masters winner and golfing hall of fame resident .
few would be able to name a major golfing event which takes place in germany . however , germany plays home to one of the european tour ’ s main events once a season when the top players in the game come to gut lärchenhof near cologne to contest for prize money that totals € 3 million .
and this year , more people are likely to get to hear about it as the championship has already seen a european record after just one round of play . record breaking first day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard langer .
the 28-year-old swede fredrik jacobson wrote his name into the annals of european tour history on thursday when he completed his day ’ s work twelve shots under the recommended number players should take to get round the course .
jacobson ’ s 12 under par gave him the lead in the linde german masters but also made him only one of 10 players ever to complete a course in 60 shots on a european tour event . he very nearly broke all records when he arrived at his final challenge of the first day , the ninth hole , needing to complete the hole in one shot less than the par to record a round of 59 .
unfortunately , it was not to be and the swede equalled the european record instead of beating it . such feats may tweak the interest of the foreign enthusiast in the direction of germany for the duration of the tournament which ends on september 21 , but for the local golf fan , it is just one of the attractions of a sport that is growing in popularity across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay and play or ride all day .
before bernhard langer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- success , there was n't much interest in golf in germany . now , however , the construction of over 100 new courses is a strong indication that the germans have taken a liking to the sport . the numbers of official golf clubs is on the rise , increasing three-fold since 1987 according to the german golf association .
germany ’ s official golf body boasts 622 clubs and 13 federal associations , and boasts more than 350,000 members . serious money members of association clubs usually have to possess a license called a platzreife which is awarded to a player who has taken a five-day course that involves several hours of training each day and a series of written and practical tests for the price of around € 300 . the platzreife is actually a legal requirement to play golf in registered clubs in germany , instituted over 40 years ago .
no other country in europe requires such a license , but german golfing associations say it is necessary to prevent unskilled players from holding up the games of others . however , there are other ways .
some german courses are semi-private , meaning visitors are welcome , although usually only monday through thursday and will cost the visitor € 60 for the privilege .
some other clubs cost somewhat less to play . # b # the cheaper priced courses reflect the fact that most german clubs still expect their golfers to walk with only a few of the bigger clubs providing motorized carts at prices that include their hire . tournaments for all for the adventurous golfer in germany , or the confident one , many german clubs offer the opportunity to take part in open tournaments to players outside their membership .
these tournaments are recommended to those who intend to spend the whole day at the club teeing off and putting away happily as they tend to be the same price or less than a usual day pass and include a meal , such as an awards dinner where formal attire is insisted upon . typical to the national mentality , the germans have taken to golf in a very technical way , focussing on the skill aspects of golf and spending a lot of time taking lessons and practicing , both on the range and on the course .
this has permeated into their well regimented and valued leisure time with a booming trade in hotels combining well-earned breaks with course passes becoming a country-wide phenomenon . so in germany , the old adage that , for many , golf is a pleasant walk spoiled could not be further from the truth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hosts most sporting events germany may not have the olympics and it may still have to wait a few years before hosting the world cup , but it 's ranked number one in the number of sporting events .

however , no german troops will set foot in iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder declared in an interview on thursday that germany is prepared to train iraqi police and soldiers in the country ’ s first step towards helping to rebuild iraq .
the announcement , jointly published in the the wall street journal and german business daily handelsblatt , comes just days before the chancellor flies to new york for a meeting of the u.n. general assembly where he is expected to hold talks with u.s. president george w. bush on the sidelines .
as far as concessions go , germany ’ s decision should be accepted as a major breakthrough in the standoff with the united states which began towards the end of last year but exploded in acrimony over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in the spring .
although discussions between schröder and bush in new york have yet to be officially confirmed , the chancellor has prepared his olive branch in anticipation of talks that a german government spokesperson described as " very likely " to take place .
the meeting would herald the first face-to-face talks between the two leaders in more than a year .
germany is ready bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is ready .
“ germany is ready to help with the training of iraqi police , ” said schröder .
" iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present . "
training could take place in germany or elsewhere , he said , but it might be dangerous within iraq .
the chancellor added that the training would go ahead independently of any united nations resolution , indicating that the offer of training remained separate from the subject of troop deployments .
less such an offer of help be misinterpreted , defense minister peter struck reiterated on friday that it did not mean a shift towards the german military playing an active role in iraq .
with over 200,000 german troops already deployed abroad , “ there is no need for germany to station troops there , ” he said .
on the surface , schröder ’ s offer appears to be a compromise that suits both sides . his resolve that there will be no german military involvement in iraq without a new u.n. mandate remains intact while he hopes that the german move is gratefully accepted by washington which is struggling to convince the international community to assist in the continuously dangerous process of stabilizing post-war iraq .
either way , it is likely to reheat a relationship that has been distinctly icy of late .
germany , u.s. must win the peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush was not a happy man .
in an open letter published in the new york times on thursday , schröder wrote , “ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate .
we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ”
schröder also took the opportunity to pledge more german humanitarian support : “ in addition to its current military involvement in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere , germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces . ”
humanitarian aid certain heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for development and economic co-operation , echoed the chancellor ’ s pledge by saying in friday ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that germany ’ s commitment to aiding iraq , “ went without saying . ”
she added that germany wished to be involved in the donors conference in madrid in october , a pledging round organized by the spanish government in a bid to rally humanitarian support for iraq .

however , no german troops will set foot in iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder declared in an interview on thursday that germany is prepared to train iraqi police and soldiers in the country ’ s first step towards helping to rebuild iraq .
the announcement , jointly published in the the wall street journal and german business daily handelsblatt , comes just days before the chancellor flies to new york for a meeting of the u.n. general assembly where he is expected to hold talks with u.s. president george w. bush on the sidelines .
as far as concessions go , germany ’ s decision should be accepted as a major breakthrough in the standoff with the united states which began towards the end of last year but exploded in acrimony over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in the spring .
although discussions between schröder and bush in new york have yet to be officially confirmed , the chancellor has prepared his olive branch in anticipation of talks that a german government spokesperson described as " very likely " to take place .

" iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .

training could take place in germany or elsewhere , he said , but it might be dangerous within iraq .
the chancellor added that the training would go ahead independently of any united nations resolution , indicating that the offer of training remained separate from the subject of troop deployments .
less such an offer of help be misinterpreted , defense minister peter struck reiterated on friday that it did not mean a shift towards the german military playing an active role in iraq .
with over 200,000 german troops already deployed abroad , “ there is no need for germany to station troops there , ” he said .
on the surface , schröder ’ s offer appears to be a compromise that suits both sides . his resolve that there will be no german military involvement in iraq without a new u.n. mandate remains intact while he hopes that the german move is gratefully accepted by washington which is struggling to convince the international community to assist in the continuously dangerous process of stabilizing post-war iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.09.2003 energy storm turns to a breeze großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what does the future hold for germany 's wind power ?
after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy . chancellor gerhard schröder met with economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party in an intimate ‘ energy summit ’ designed to take the wind out of a gusty debate on the future of germany ’ s national energy supply .
joined by the chairmen of the country ’ s main energy providers , enbw .
e.on , rwe and vattenfall , and representatives of the industrial concern thyssen krupp and chemical giant basf , the chancellor and his ministers rolled up their sleeves and discussed the fate of traditional energy sources such as coal and gas and alternative forms such as wind and solar .
the two-hour meeting had been preceded by an ongoing dispute between clement and trittin over germany ’ s energy mix and hefty subsidies for alternative power sources .
meeting environmental goals despite initial hesitancy and a spattering of criticism from both sides , the meeting was hailed a success .
although , as a government spokesman explained prior to the talks , the participants were not expecting any concrete resolutions , the word from those emerging from the chancellor ’ s office , was of a stimulating and constructive debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was conspicuously not invited to a meeting between schröder and the heads of the nation ’ s top four energy companies in the wake of the historic u.s. blackout last month , was evidently happy with thursday ’ s talks .
he told reporters that his views on emissions trading and climate protection had met with far-reaching agreement , although he added that the details had yet to be discussed .
emissions trading energy companies in germany are currently waiting for the government to announce the level of emissions rights they will be granted under the emissions trading system to be introduced in europe in 2005 .
the system , which creates financial incentives to reduce pollution in order to fulfil the reduction commitments assumed under the kyoto protocol , operates on the basis of allowance certificates .
if a company produces more emissions than its pollution allowance permits , it will be able to purchase rights from another company which does not exhaust its full allowance .
the incentive is for companies to generate as little carbon dioxide emissions as possible in order to sell off their unused allowance at a profit .
although germany is ahead of the rest of europe and has largely met its kyoto commitments , trittin is determined to see a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt on thursday , the environment minister said his stance was largely based on the commitment which german industry had imposed on itself .
will the sails keep turning ?
the other , albeit secondary issue , on the agenda at thursday ’ s talks still remains a point of conflict within the red-green coalition .
jürgen trittin a strong proponent of wind power and renewable energy sources , butted heads with wolfgang clement , who supports holding on to traditional energy sources .
clement has criticized the greens ’ overemphasis on wind energy and has said the wind parks sprouting across the land are at best " over subsidized " and at worst inefficient .
the green party and other supporters of renewable energy argue that not only do the giant wind turbines generate clean power and protect the environment , but that they also lead to the creation of almost 50,000 jobs .
there are currently 14,000 wind power generators operating in germany , more than anywhere else in the world , and if the environment minister gets his way , 12.5 percent of germany ’ s overall energy output will come from renewable sources by the year 2012 , and 20 percent by the year 2020 , with costs falling year by year .
not everybody 's darling but those on the other side of the fence argue that the jobs come at a high price and ultimately the consumer has to pay the cost through subsidies .
there is also concern that wind turbines don ’ t always generate enough energy , and that some locations which have been selected as wind farm sites are too sheltered to be able to do the job properly .
and it is not only politicians who are opposed to the mass expansion of germany ’ s wind parks , there is also dissent in rural regions , where residents fear the charming countryside , and hence the tourist attraction , will be marred by what has been dubbed ‘ the asparagus effect ’ of the almost-trifid like constructions .

after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy . chancellor gerhard schröder met with economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party in an intimate ‘ energy summit ’ designed to take the wind out of a gusty debate on the future of germany ’ s national energy supply .
joined by the chairmen of the country ’ s main energy providers , enbw .
e.on , rwe and vattenfall , and representatives of the industrial concern thyssen krupp and chemical giant basf , the chancellor and his ministers rolled up their sleeves and discussed the fate of traditional energy sources such as coal and gas and alternative forms such as wind and solar .
the two-hour meeting had been preceded by an ongoing dispute between clement and trittin over germany ’ s energy mix and hefty subsidies for alternative power sources .
meeting environmental goals despite initial hesitancy and a spattering of criticism from both sides , the meeting was hailed a success .
although , as a government spokesman explained prior to the talks , the participants were not expecting any concrete resolutions , the word from those emerging from the chancellor ’ s office , was of a stimulating and constructive debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was conspicuously not invited to a meeting between schröder and the heads of the nation ’ s top four energy companies in the wake of the historic u.s. blackout last month , was evidently happy with thursday ’ s talks .
he told reporters that his views on emissions trading and climate protection had met with far-reaching agreement , although he added that the details had yet to be discussed .
emissions trading energy companies in germany are currently waiting for the government to announce the level of emissions rights they will be granted under the emissions trading system to be introduced in europe in 2005 .
the system , which creates financial incentives to reduce pollution in order to fulfil the reduction commitments assumed under the kyoto protocol , operates on the basis of allowance certificates .
if a company produces more emissions than its pollution allowance permits , it will be able to purchase rights from another company which does not exhaust its full allowance .
the incentive is for companies to generate as little carbon dioxide emissions as possible in order to sell off their unused allowance at a profit .
although germany is ahead of the rest of europe and has largely met its kyoto commitments , trittin is determined to see a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt on thursday , the environment minister said his stance was largely based on the commitment which german industry had imposed on itself .
will the sails keep turning ?
the other , albeit secondary issue , on the agenda at thursday ’ s talks still remains a point of conflict within the red-green coalition .
jürgen trittin a strong proponent of wind power and renewable energy sources , butted heads with wolfgang clement , who supports holding on to traditional energy sources .
clement has criticized the greens ’ overemphasis on wind energy and has said the wind parks sprouting across the land are at best " over subsidized " and at worst inefficient .
the green party and other supporters of renewable energy argue that not only do the giant wind turbines generate clean power and protect the environment , but that they also lead to the creation of almost 50,000 jobs .
there are currently 14,000 wind power generators operating in germany , more than anywhere else in the world , and if the environment minister gets his way , 12.5 percent of germany ’ s overall energy output will come from renewable sources by the year 2012 , and 20 percent by the year 2020 , with costs falling year by year .
not everybody 's darling but those on the other side of the fence argue that the jobs come at a high price and ultimately the consumer has to pay the cost through subsidies .
there is also concern that wind turbines don ’ t always generate enough energy , and that some locations which have been selected as wind farm sites are too sheltered to be able to do the job properly .
and it is not only politicians who are opposed to the mass expansion of germany ’ s wind parks , there is also dissent in rural regions , where residents fear the charming countryside , and hence the tourist attraction , will be marred by what has been dubbed ‘ the asparagus effect ’ of the almost-trifid like constructions .

though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is . officially , there haven ’ t been any complaints .
but behind the scenes , the decision not to invite the leaders of spain and italy to saturday ’ s iraq summit in berlin has roiled the chattering classes in madrid and rome .
though the governments of the mediterranean countries aren ’ t expressing it , observers say they feel left out .
at their meeting on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair will seek to end the rift that has lasted for months between the countries on the iraq question .
that ’ s all well and good , but major newspapers in spain and italy have complained in editorials that the exclusion of spanish prime minister josé maria aznar and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is a form of punishment from german and france for those leaders ' steadfast support of u.s. president george w. bush 's hawkishness .
deliberately excluded ?
describing the snub as an " affront " to spain , the influential el mundo wrote that " it ’ s obvious the leaders of germany and france have deliberately excluded " spanish prime minister josé maria aznar .
" more than any other european country spain should have been at this meeting " because of its support for us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair and its role as a un security council member , the paper wrote .
madrid has already contributed € 81.9 million to the u.s.-led war effort in iraq , and the defense ministry estimates the country ’ s contributions to the reconstruction of iraq could reach € 170 million .
" how long , " the paper asked , " are paris and berlin going to punish aznar for his pro-american stance ? "
el mundo also wrote that aznar ’ s snub may also have been influenced by his recent criticism of france for failing to do more to reign in its deficit spending .
earlier this month , french officials admitted the country would exceed the 3 percent ceiling in deficit spending required by the stability and growth pact that guarantees the strength of the euro for the third year in a row .
aznar ’ s criticisms also drew a rebuke from german chancellor gerhard schröder , who reminded the spaniards that their own economic growth has been fueled by eu subsidies – 25 percent of which are funded by berlin .
another major spanish paper , el periodico , opined that " jose maria aznar is starting to pay for his unconditional support of president bush ’ s warlike strategy .
chancellor schröder has excluded him from the berlin summit . "
the paper also noted that aznar was unable to paper over his differences with france over the iraq war at a recent meeting with chirac .
and the country ’ s unofficial paper of record , el pais , said the development showed aznar " finds himself marginalized on major negotiations " over iraq .
criticism has also been strong in italy , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union .
rome ’ s la repubblica opined this week that berlusconi ’ s exclusion suggested that italy was losing its diplomatic importance .
playing down the tensions still , politicians in both countries have sought to play down the significance of their exclusion .
italian foreign minister franco frattini characterized the berlin meeting as an " informal meal , " and aznar has taken pains to point out that he will be meeting in london with blair one day after the meeting and that he has discussed the iraq resolution with both chirac and berlusconi .
" not everybody is invited everywhere , " spanish foreign minister ana palacio told reporters in madrid .
" it is a working meeting proposed by german so that france and the united kingdom - two key states in the construction of europe - can overcome certain positions that they have had at one time or another . "
a spokesman for tony blair said on tuesday that he valued his contacts with aznar and other european leaders " as much as he valued his contacts with chancellor schröder and president chirac . "
and a report in the british newspaper the guardian suggested that blair had argued unsuccessfully in favor of inviting aznar to the meeting .
meanwhile , german government spokesman bela anda also sought to play down the decision not to invite italy or spain to the informal meeting , saying the meeting was " not directed against anyone . "
additionally , the leaders of germany , britain and france have also contacted other eu member states to discuss the meeting , but have not extended invitations to any other countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , chirac , blair to seek deal on iraq the leaders of france , germany and great britain are meeting in berlin on saturday .

a court has handed down a ruling calling for josef ackermann , the chief of deutsche bank to be tried on charges of dishonest behavior relating to vodaphone 's 2000 takeover of mannesmann . a regional court in düsseldorf has ruled to admit charges of fraud against josef ackermann , the swiss-born chief executive of deutsche bank . ackermann and five others were charged in february with fraud relating to the 2000 takeover of the german mobile phone giant mannesmann by its british rival vodafone .
the case has since become known as the " mannesmann affair .

gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .
it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq . in a sign that relations between the two countries are on the mend , german chancellor gerhard schröder will meet with u.s. president george w. bush for private talks on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly on wednesday . schröder will arrive with several offers of help that many hope will put german-american relations on the road to normalization .
schröder has said germany is prepared to help train iraqi police , educate the iraqi military and help finance infrastructure projects involving german companies in iraq . schröder told the handelsblatt newspaper that the offers were independent of any u.n. resolution on post-war reconstruction in iraq . “ iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present , ” he told the newspaper . the chancellor warned however , that germany ’ s budget is tight and that financial contributions to iraq will be moderate .
“ we have no plans to offer money , ” he said . staying on message schröder will be attempting to strike a delicate balance during the talks with bush .
while the chancellor wants germany to be seen as a partner to the u.s. , he needs to avoid running the risk of seeming to justify or support bush ’ s position on iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the government , schröder ’ s position on iraq has not changed , and officials insist the chancellor is not going to new york to “ give in ” in any way . “ it ’ s not about concessions , ” karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german government , told reuters .
“ it ’ s about changing the environment . ” schröder goes to the u.s. in a somewhat stronger position , given that george w. bush is in a weaker one .
the u.s. president has come under increasing pressure , particularly at home , as u.s. peacekeepers in iraq face rising instability on the ground and near-daily american casualties , while the price tag for the war spirals out of control . but schröder appears to be avoiding any public expression of schadenfreude .
as he told the handelsblatt , it is time to look forward . “ those who favored the war - and that does n't mean just the u.s. , but also great britain and other european countries as well as those who , for considerable reasons , opposed it , must now all accept their common responsibility , ” he said . any country which stays on the sidelines , he said , “ is making a mistake . ” still , schröder has insisted that german participation in iraq will be limited to civilian reconstruction efforts or training programs .
germany , he warned , “ can not participate in any military action in iraq . ” “ now it ’ s all about reconstructing iraq , not about a military engagement that we are not considering and for which we have no plans , ” schröder said . let bygones be bygones the relationship between berlin and washington turned frosty ever since schröder ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
schröder , along with french president jacques chirac , was at the head of an anti-war coalition in the build-up to military action against saddam hussein .
bush was incensed that schröder used his critique of u.s. foreign policy to help get reelected last year . but lately , both sides have shown signs that the deep freeze in ties has begun to thaw .

gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .
it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq . in a sign that relations between the two countries are on the mend , german chancellor gerhard schröder will meet with u.s. president george w. bush for private talks on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly on wednesday . schröder will arrive with several offers of help that many hope will put german-american relations on the road to normalization .
schröder has said germany is prepared to help train iraqi police , educate the iraqi military and help finance infrastructure projects involving german companies in iraq . schröder told the handelsblatt newspaper that the offers were independent of any u.n. resolution on post-war reconstruction in iraq . “ iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present , ” he told the newspaper . the chancellor warned however , that germany ’ s budget is tight and that financial contributions to iraq will be moderate .
“ we have no plans to offer money , ” he said . staying on message schröder will be attempting to strike a delicate balance during the talks with bush .
while the chancellor wants germany to be seen as a partner to the u.s. , he needs to avoid running the risk of seeming to justify or support bush ’ s position on iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the government , schröder ’ s position on iraq has not changed , and officials insist the chancellor is not going to new york to “ give in ” in any way . “ it ’ s not about concessions , ” karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german government , told reuters .
“ it ’ s about changing the environment . ” schröder goes to the u.s. in a somewhat stronger position , given that george w. bush is in a weaker one .
the u.s. president has come under increasing pressure , particularly at home , as u.s. peacekeepers in iraq face rising instability on the ground and near-daily american casualties , while the price tag for the war spirals out of control . but schröder appears to be avoiding any public expression of schadenfreude .
as he told the handelsblatt , it is time to look forward . “ those who favored the war - and that does n't mean just the u.s. , but also great britain and other european countries as well as those who , for considerable reasons , opposed it , must now all accept their common responsibility , ” he said . any country which stays on the sidelines , he said , “ is making a mistake . ” still , schröder has insisted that german participation in iraq will be limited to civilian reconstruction efforts or training programs .
germany , he warned , “ can not participate in any military action in iraq . ” “ now it ’ s all about reconstructing iraq , not about a military engagement that we are not considering and for which we have no plans , ” schröder said . let bygones be bygones the relationship between berlin and washington turned frosty ever since schröder ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
schröder , along with french president jacques chirac , was at the head of an anti-war coalition in the build-up to military action against saddam hussein .
bush was incensed that schröder used his critique of u.s. foreign policy to help get reelected last year . but lately , both sides have shown signs that the deep freeze in ties has begun to thaw .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2003 beer frenzy in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prost !
visitors to the oktoberfest drink an average 5 liters of beer beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
one of these , and probably the most significant , is the annual oktoberfest .
the festival , which traditionally begins on the 21st of september , attracts more than six million visitors each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waitresses in the traditional bavarian " dirndl " swing their mugs and dance among the crowd .
it is said to be the largest public bash in the world .
in just 14 days , visitors consume more than five million liters of beer and up to 200,000 pork sausages .
an impressive 14 specially constructed giant " beer tents " with room for an average 7,000 drinkers are put up by munich 's breweries for the event , which begins when the first keg is tapped in the so-called schottenhammel tent .
a long-time tradition , the mayor personally ' taps ' the first barrel of beer and shouts " o 'zapft is ! " -lrb- the keg is tapped -rrb- .
then the festivities begin . dancing on tables bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer mugs on a table in a beer tent at the oktoberfest in munich , bavaria .
with the keg tapping over , the ' fest ' can begin .
as the beer flows freely and long trestle tables groan under the weight of the huge , heavy one-liter mugs and impromptu dancing begins on slippery table tops , dedicated oktoberfest fans start setting up camp on the surrounding fields .
for many , the festivity lasts for several days , beginning when the first tents open at ten , until long into the cool , late summer night . despite its name , the oktoberfest actually kicks off in september , since the chances of the weather cooperating are greater .
the reasons for the festival 's name lie in its origins .
it all began with the celebrated marriage on october 12 , 1810 of the bavarian crown prince ludwig -lrb- later known as ludwig the first -rrb- to princess therese from the german kingdom of saxony-hildburghausen , who gave her name to the theresienwiese , where the oktoberfest takes place .

however , competition is growing .
already , there is a smaller , yet just as beery oktoberfest which takes place at the same time in berlin .

as the german open golf championship continues in glorious cologne sunshine , the inquisitive observer may look on with bemusement .
golf in germany ?
surely you mean the car … when asked a question that involves the words “ germany ” and “ golf ” , most people outside the country itself will automatically think of the popular volkswagen hatchback .
those with a little more knowledge of the sport which shares the same name as vw ’ s flagship motor may be able to combine the two terms and come up with the name of bernhard langer , germany ’ s double u.s. masters winner and golfing hall of fame resident .
few would be able to name a major golfing event which takes place in germany . however , germany plays home to one of the european tour ’ s main events once a season when the top players in the game come to gut lärchenhof near cologne to contest for prize money that totals € 3 million .
and this year , more people are likely to get to hear about it as the championship has already seen a european record after just one round of play . record breaking first day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard langer .
the 28-year-old swede fredrik jacobson wrote his name into the annals of european tour history on thursday when he completed his day ’ s work twelve shots under the recommended number players should take to get round the course .
jacobson ’ s 12 under par gave him the lead in the linde german masters but also made him only one of 10 players ever to complete a course in 60 shots on a european tour event . he very nearly broke all records when he arrived at his final challenge of the first day , the ninth hole , needing to complete the hole in one shot less than the par to record a round of 59 .
unfortunately , it was not to be and the swede equalled the european record instead of beating it . such feats may tweak the interest of the foreign enthusiast in the direction of germany for the duration of the tournament which ends on september 21 , but for the local golf fan , it is just one of the attractions of a sport that is growing in popularity across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay and play or ride all day .
before bernhard langer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- success , there was n't much interest in golf in germany . now , however , the construction of over 100 new courses is a strong indication that the germans have taken a liking to the sport . the numbers of official golf clubs is on the rise , increasing three-fold since 1987 according to the german golf association .

golf in germany ?
surely you mean the car … when asked a question that involves the words “ germany ” and “ golf ” , most people outside the country itself will automatically think of the popular volkswagen hatchback .
those with a little more knowledge of the sport which shares the same name as vw ’ s flagship motor may be able to combine the two terms and come up with the name of bernhard langer , germany ’ s double u.s. masters winner and golfing hall of fame resident .
few would be able to name a major golfing event which takes place in germany . however , germany plays home to one of the european tour ’ s main events once a season when the top players in the game come to gut lärchenhof near cologne to contest for prize money that totals € 3 million .
and this year , more people are likely to get to hear about it as the championship has already seen a european record after just one round of play . record breaking first day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard langer .
the 28-year-old swede fredrik jacobson wrote his name into the annals of european tour history on thursday when he completed his day ’ s work twelve shots under the recommended number players should take to get round the course .
jacobson ’ s 12 under par gave him the lead in the linde german masters but also made him only one of 10 players ever to complete a course in 60 shots on a european tour event . he very nearly broke all records when he arrived at his final challenge of the first day , the ninth hole , needing to complete the hole in one shot less than the par to record a round of 59 .
unfortunately , it was not to be and the swede equalled the european record instead of beating it . such feats may tweak the interest of the foreign enthusiast in the direction of germany for the duration of the tournament which ends on september 21 , but for the local golf fan , it is just one of the attractions of a sport that is growing in popularity across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay and play or ride all day .
before bernhard langer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- success , there was n't much interest in golf in germany . now , however , the construction of over 100 new courses is a strong indication that the germans have taken a liking to the sport . the numbers of official golf clubs is on the rise , increasing three-fold since 1987 according to the german golf association .

though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is . officially , there haven ’ t been any complaints .
but behind the scenes , the decision not to invite the leaders of spain and italy to saturday ’ s iraq summit in berlin has roiled the chattering classes in madrid and rome .
though the governments of the mediterranean countries aren ’ t expressing it , observers say they feel left out .
at their meeting on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair will seek to end the rift that has lasted for months between the countries on the iraq question .
that ’ s all well and good , but major newspapers in spain and italy have complained in editorials that the exclusion of spanish prime minister josé maria aznar and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is a form of punishment from german and france for those leaders ' steadfast support of u.s. president george w. bush 's hawkishness .
deliberately excluded ?
describing the snub as an " affront " to spain , the influential el mundo wrote that " it ’ s obvious the leaders of germany and france have deliberately excluded " spanish prime minister josé maria aznar .
" more than any other european country spain should have been at this meeting " because of its support for us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair and its role as a un security council member , the paper wrote .
madrid has already contributed € 81.9 million to the u.s.-led war effort in iraq , and the defense ministry estimates the country ’ s contributions to the reconstruction of iraq could reach € 170 million .
" how long , " the paper asked , " are paris and berlin going to punish aznar for his pro-american stance ? "
el mundo also wrote that aznar ’ s snub may also have been influenced by his recent criticism of france for failing to do more to reign in its deficit spending .
earlier this month , french officials admitted the country would exceed the 3 percent ceiling in deficit spending required by the stability and growth pact that guarantees the strength of the euro for the third year in a row .
aznar ’ s criticisms also drew a rebuke from german chancellor gerhard schröder , who reminded the spaniards that their own economic growth has been fueled by eu subsidies – 25 percent of which are funded by berlin .
another major spanish paper , el periodico , opined that " jose maria aznar is starting to pay for his unconditional support of president bush ’ s warlike strategy .
chancellor schröder has excluded him from the berlin summit . "
the paper also noted that aznar was unable to paper over his differences with france over the iraq war at a recent meeting with chirac .
and the country ’ s unofficial paper of record , el pais , said the development showed aznar " finds himself marginalized on major negotiations " over iraq .
criticism has also been strong in italy , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union .
rome ’ s la repubblica opined this week that berlusconi ’ s exclusion suggested that italy was losing its diplomatic importance .
playing down the tensions still , politicians in both countries have sought to play down the significance of their exclusion .
italian foreign minister franco frattini characterized the berlin meeting as an " informal meal , " and aznar has taken pains to point out that he will be meeting in london with blair one day after the meeting and that he has discussed the iraq resolution with both chirac and berlusconi .
" not everybody is invited everywhere , " spanish foreign minister ana palacio told reporters in madrid .
" it is a working meeting proposed by german so that france and the united kingdom - two key states in the construction of europe - can overcome certain positions that they have had at one time or another . "
a spokesman for tony blair said on tuesday that he valued his contacts with aznar and other european leaders " as much as he valued his contacts with chancellor schröder and president chirac . "
and a report in the british newspaper the guardian suggested that blair had argued unsuccessfully in favor of inviting aznar to the meeting .
meanwhile , german government spokesman bela anda also sought to play down the decision not to invite italy or spain to the informal meeting , saying the meeting was " not directed against anyone . "
additionally , the leaders of germany , britain and france have also contacted other eu member states to discuss the meeting , but have not extended invitations to any other countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , chirac , blair to seek deal on iraq the leaders of france , germany and great britain are meeting in berlin on saturday .

playing down the tensions still , politicians in both countries have sought to play down the significance of their exclusion .
italian foreign minister franco frattini characterized the berlin meeting as an " informal meal , " and aznar has taken pains to point out that he will be meeting in london with blair one day after the meeting and that he has discussed the iraq resolution with both chirac and berlusconi .
" not everybody is invited everywhere , " spanish foreign minister ana palacio told reporters in madrid .
" it is a working meeting proposed by german so that france and the united kingdom - two key states in the construction of europe - can overcome certain positions that they have had at one time or another . "
a spokesman for tony blair said on tuesday that he valued his contacts with aznar and other european leaders " as much as he valued his contacts with chancellor schröder and president chirac . "
and a report in the british newspaper the guardian suggested that blair had argued unsuccessfully in favor of inviting aznar to the meeting .
meanwhile , german government spokesman bela anda also sought to play down the decision not to invite italy or spain to the informal meeting , saying the meeting was " not directed against anyone . "
additionally , the leaders of germany , britain and france have also contacted other eu member states to discuss the meeting , but have not extended invitations to any other countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , chirac , blair to seek deal on iraq the leaders of france , germany and great britain are meeting in berlin on saturday .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2003 beer frenzy in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prost !
visitors to the oktoberfest drink an average 5 liters of beer beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
one of these , and probably the most significant , is the annual oktoberfest .
the festival , which traditionally begins on the 21st of september , attracts more than six million visitors each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waitresses in the traditional bavarian " dirndl " swing their mugs and dance among the crowd .
it is said to be the largest public bash in the world .
in just 14 days , visitors consume more than five million liters of beer and up to 200,000 pork sausages .
an impressive 14 specially constructed giant " beer tents " with room for an average 7,000 drinkers are put up by munich 's breweries for the event , which begins when the first keg is tapped in the so-called schottenhammel tent .
a long-time tradition , the mayor personally ' taps ' the first barrel of beer and shouts " o 'zapft is ! " -lrb- the keg is tapped -rrb- .
then the festivities begin . dancing on tables bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer mugs on a table in a beer tent at the oktoberfest in munich , bavaria .
with the keg tapping over , the ' fest ' can begin .
as the beer flows freely and long trestle tables groan under the weight of the huge , heavy one-liter mugs and impromptu dancing begins on slippery table tops , dedicated oktoberfest fans start setting up camp on the surrounding fields .
for many , the festivity lasts for several days , beginning when the first tents open at ten , until long into the cool , late summer night . despite its name , the oktoberfest actually kicks off in september , since the chances of the weather cooperating are greater .
the reasons for the festival 's name lie in its origins .
it all began with the celebrated marriage on october 12 , 1810 of the bavarian crown prince ludwig -lrb- later known as ludwig the first -rrb- to princess therese from the german kingdom of saxony-hildburghausen , who gave her name to the theresienwiese , where the oktoberfest takes place .
after such a successful party , it was decided that the celebrations should take place every year . less visitors , more fun ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer mug full of euros - the oktoberfest is a major money-making event in munich .
today , visitor numbers are declining but oktoberfest is still a major event on the german calendar .
not just in a cultural sense : an average € 1 billion rolls into the registers of breweries , taxis and hotels during the two weeks of the festival .
however , competition is growing .
already , there is a smaller , yet just as beery oktoberfest which takes place at the same time in berlin .
and this year , londoners do n't need to go far to get a taste of their favorite bavarian brew : instead , they can stay at home and enjoy their first , very own london-based bavarian-style beer ' fest ' . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .
it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq . in a sign that relations between the two countries are on the mend , german chancellor gerhard schröder will meet with u.s. president george w. bush for private talks on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly on wednesday . schröder will arrive with several offers of help that many hope will put german-american relations on the road to normalization .
schröder has said germany is prepared to help train iraqi police , educate the iraqi military and help finance infrastructure projects involving german companies in iraq . schröder told the handelsblatt newspaper that the offers were independent of any u.n. resolution on post-war reconstruction in iraq . “ iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .

“ we have no plans to offer money , ” he said . staying on message schröder will be attempting to strike a delicate balance during the talks with bush .
while the chancellor wants germany to be seen as a partner to the u.s. , he needs to avoid running the risk of seeming to justify or support bush ’ s position on iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the government , schröder ’ s position on iraq has not changed , and officials insist the chancellor is not going to new york to “ give in ” in any way . “ it ’ s not about concessions , ” karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german government , told reuters .

the u.s. president has come under increasing pressure , particularly at home , as u.s. peacekeepers in iraq face rising instability on the ground and near-daily american casualties , while the price tag for the war spirals out of control . but schröder appears to be avoiding any public expression of schadenfreude .
as he told the handelsblatt , it is time to look forward . “ those who favored the war - and that does n't mean just the u.s. , but also great britain and other european countries as well as those who , for considerable reasons , opposed it , must now all accept their common responsibility , ” he said . any country which stays on the sidelines , he said , “ is making a mistake . ” still , schröder has insisted that german participation in iraq will be limited to civilian reconstruction efforts or training programs .
germany , he warned , “ can not participate in any military action in iraq . ” “ now it ’ s all about reconstructing iraq , not about a military engagement that we are not considering and for which we have no plans , ” schröder said . let bygones be bygones the relationship between berlin and washington turned frosty ever since schröder ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .

gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : munich welcomes the world oktoberfest is good for you , sort of the dark cloud over oktoberfest a lederhosen boycott for oktoberfest ?
the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2003 beer frenzy in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prost !
visitors to the oktoberfest drink an average 5 liters of beer beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
one of these , and probably the most significant , is the annual oktoberfest .
the festival , which traditionally begins on the 21st of september , attracts more than six million visitors each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waitresses in the traditional bavarian " dirndl " swing their mugs and dance among the crowd .
it is said to be the largest public bash in the world .
in just 14 days , visitors consume more than five million liters of beer and up to 200,000 pork sausages .
an impressive 14 specially constructed giant " beer tents " with room for an average 7,000 drinkers are put up by munich 's breweries for the event , which begins when the first keg is tapped in the so-called schottenhammel tent .
a long-time tradition , the mayor personally ' taps ' the first barrel of beer and shouts " o 'zapft is ! " -lrb- the keg is tapped -rrb- .
then the festivities begin . dancing on tables bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer mugs on a table in a beer tent at the oktoberfest in munich , bavaria .
with the keg tapping over , the ' fest ' can begin .
as the beer flows freely and long trestle tables groan under the weight of the huge , heavy one-liter mugs and impromptu dancing begins on slippery table tops , dedicated oktoberfest fans start setting up camp on the surrounding fields .
for many , the festivity lasts for several days , beginning when the first tents open at ten , until long into the cool , late summer night . despite its name , the oktoberfest actually kicks off in september , since the chances of the weather cooperating are greater .
the reasons for the festival 's name lie in its origins .
it all began with the celebrated marriage on october 12 , 1810 of the bavarian crown prince ludwig -lrb- later known as ludwig the first -rrb- to princess therese from the german kingdom of saxony-hildburghausen , who gave her name to the theresienwiese , where the oktoberfest takes place .
after such a successful party , it was decided that the celebrations should take place every year . less visitors , more fun ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer mug full of euros - the oktoberfest is a major money-making event in munich .
today , visitor numbers are declining but oktoberfest is still a major event on the german calendar .
not just in a cultural sense : an average € 1 billion rolls into the registers of breweries , taxis and hotels during the two weeks of the festival .
however , competition is growing .
already , there is a smaller , yet just as beery oktoberfest which takes place at the same time in berlin .
and this year , londoners do n't need to go far to get a taste of their favorite bavarian brew : instead , they can stay at home and enjoy their first , very own london-based bavarian-style beer ' fest ' . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .
but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the wiesn . -lrb- june 9 , 03 -rrb- germany 's favorite beverage : beer dw-world has compiled a collection of stories on what the brew actually means to a nation of die-hard beer-worshippers .

gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .
it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq . in a sign that relations between the two countries are on the mend , german chancellor gerhard schröder will meet with u.s. president george w. bush for private talks on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly on wednesday . schröder will arrive with several offers of help that many hope will put german-american relations on the road to normalization .
schröder has said germany is prepared to help train iraqi police , educate the iraqi military and help finance infrastructure projects involving german companies in iraq . schröder told the handelsblatt newspaper that the offers were independent of any u.n. resolution on post-war reconstruction in iraq . “ iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present , ” he told the newspaper . the chancellor warned however , that germany ’ s budget is tight and that financial contributions to iraq will be moderate .
“ we have no plans to offer money , ” he said . staying on message schröder will be attempting to strike a delicate balance during the talks with bush .
while the chancellor wants germany to be seen as a partner to the u.s. , he needs to avoid running the risk of seeming to justify or support bush ’ s position on iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the government , schröder ’ s position on iraq has not changed , and officials insist the chancellor is not going to new york to “ give in ” in any way . “ it ’ s not about concessions , ” karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german government , told reuters .
“ it ’ s about changing the environment . ” schröder goes to the u.s. in a somewhat stronger position , given that george w. bush is in a weaker one .
the u.s. president has come under increasing pressure , particularly at home , as u.s. peacekeepers in iraq face rising instability on the ground and near-daily american casualties , while the price tag for the war spirals out of control . but schröder appears to be avoiding any public expression of schadenfreude .
as he told the handelsblatt , it is time to look forward . “ those who favored the war - and that does n't mean just the u.s. , but also great britain and other european countries as well as those who , for considerable reasons , opposed it , must now all accept their common responsibility , ” he said . any country which stays on the sidelines , he said , “ is making a mistake . ” still , schröder has insisted that german participation in iraq will be limited to civilian reconstruction efforts or training programs .
germany , he warned , “ can not participate in any military action in iraq . ” “ now it ’ s all about reconstructing iraq , not about a military engagement that we are not considering and for which we have no plans , ” schröder said . let bygones be bygones the relationship between berlin and washington turned frosty ever since schröder ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
schröder , along with french president jacques chirac , was at the head of an anti-war coalition in the build-up to military action against saddam hussein .
bush was incensed that schröder used his critique of u.s. foreign policy to help get reelected last year . but lately , both sides have shown signs that the deep freeze in ties has begun to thaw .
schröder indicated a willingness to help in the war against terrorism by promising a stronger involvement in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified german soldiers use their knives to prepare bread for breakfast in their room with a german flag fixed on the wall at the base of the german troops in kabul , afghanistan , on sunday , jan .

gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .
it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq . in a sign that relations between the two countries are on the mend , german chancellor gerhard schröder will meet with u.s. president george w. bush for private talks on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly on wednesday . schröder will arrive with several offers of help that many hope will put german-american relations on the road to normalization .
schröder has said germany is prepared to help train iraqi police , educate the iraqi military and help finance infrastructure projects involving german companies in iraq . schröder told the handelsblatt newspaper that the offers were independent of any u.n. resolution on post-war reconstruction in iraq . “ iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present , ” he told the newspaper . the chancellor warned however , that germany ’ s budget is tight and that financial contributions to iraq will be moderate .
“ we have no plans to offer money , ” he said . staying on message schröder will be attempting to strike a delicate balance during the talks with bush .
while the chancellor wants germany to be seen as a partner to the u.s. , he needs to avoid running the risk of seeming to justify or support bush ’ s position on iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the government , schröder ’ s position on iraq has not changed , and officials insist the chancellor is not going to new york to “ give in ” in any way . “ it ’ s not about concessions , ” karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german government , told reuters .
“ it ’ s about changing the environment . ” schröder goes to the u.s. in a somewhat stronger position , given that george w. bush is in a weaker one .
the u.s. president has come under increasing pressure , particularly at home , as u.s. peacekeepers in iraq face rising instability on the ground and near-daily american casualties , while the price tag for the war spirals out of control . but schröder appears to be avoiding any public expression of schadenfreude .
as he told the handelsblatt , it is time to look forward . “ those who favored the war - and that does n't mean just the u.s. , but also great britain and other european countries as well as those who , for considerable reasons , opposed it , must now all accept their common responsibility , ” he said . any country which stays on the sidelines , he said , “ is making a mistake . ” still , schröder has insisted that german participation in iraq will be limited to civilian reconstruction efforts or training programs .
germany , he warned , “ can not participate in any military action in iraq . ” “ now it ’ s all about reconstructing iraq , not about a military engagement that we are not considering and for which we have no plans , ” schröder said . let bygones be bygones the relationship between berlin and washington turned frosty ever since schröder ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
schröder , along with french president jacques chirac , was at the head of an anti-war coalition in the build-up to military action against saddam hussein .
bush was incensed that schröder used his critique of u.s. foreign policy to help get reelected last year . but lately , both sides have shown signs that the deep freeze in ties has begun to thaw .
schröder indicated a willingness to help in the war against terrorism by promising a stronger involvement in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified german soldiers use their knives to prepare bread for breakfast in their room with a german flag fixed on the wall at the base of the german troops in kabul , afghanistan , on sunday , jan .

he has said germany will deploy troops in the northern city of kunduz .
germany currently provides the largest contingent of troops in afghanistan , 1,800 out of 4,000 soldiers . bush nodded in schröder ’ s direction last month by praising the plan .
“ i look forward to thanking chancellor schröder for that , ” bush said at the time . when schröder was told in the interview that u.s. officials consider the meeting a chance for the two leaders to “ bury the hatchet , ” he responded by saying he hadn ’ t been waving any hatchet . “ the press has also greatly exaggerated -lrb- the problems in our relationship -rrb- , ” he said .

after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy . chancellor gerhard schröder met with economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party in an intimate ‘ energy summit ’ designed to take the wind out of a gusty debate on the future of germany ’ s national energy supply .
joined by the chairmen of the country ’ s main energy providers , enbw .
e.on , rwe and vattenfall , and representatives of the industrial concern thyssen krupp and chemical giant basf , the chancellor and his ministers rolled up their sleeves and discussed the fate of traditional energy sources such as coal and gas and alternative forms such as wind and solar .
the two-hour meeting had been preceded by an ongoing dispute between clement and trittin over germany ’ s energy mix and hefty subsidies for alternative power sources .
meeting environmental goals despite initial hesitancy and a spattering of criticism from both sides , the meeting was hailed a success .
although , as a government spokesman explained prior to the talks , the participants were not expecting any concrete resolutions , the word from those emerging from the chancellor ’ s office , was of a stimulating and constructive debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was conspicuously not invited to a meeting between schröder and the heads of the nation ’ s top four energy companies in the wake of the historic u.s. blackout last month , was evidently happy with thursday ’ s talks .
he told reporters that his views on emissions trading and climate protection had met with far-reaching agreement , although he added that the details had yet to be discussed .
emissions trading energy companies in germany are currently waiting for the government to announce the level of emissions rights they will be granted under the emissions trading system to be introduced in europe in 2005 .
the system , which creates financial incentives to reduce pollution in order to fulfil the reduction commitments assumed under the kyoto protocol , operates on the basis of allowance certificates .
if a company produces more emissions than its pollution allowance permits , it will be able to purchase rights from another company which does not exhaust its full allowance .
the incentive is for companies to generate as little carbon dioxide emissions as possible in order to sell off their unused allowance at a profit .
although germany is ahead of the rest of europe and has largely met its kyoto commitments , trittin is determined to see a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt on thursday , the environment minister said his stance was largely based on the commitment which german industry had imposed on itself .
will the sails keep turning ?
the other , albeit secondary issue , on the agenda at thursday ’ s talks still remains a point of conflict within the red-green coalition .
jürgen trittin a strong proponent of wind power and renewable energy sources , butted heads with wolfgang clement , who supports holding on to traditional energy sources .
clement has criticized the greens ’ overemphasis on wind energy and has said the wind parks sprouting across the land are at best " over subsidized " and at worst inefficient .
the green party and other supporters of renewable energy argue that not only do the giant wind turbines generate clean power and protect the environment , but that they also lead to the creation of almost 50,000 jobs .
there are currently 14,000 wind power generators operating in germany , more than anywhere else in the world , and if the environment minister gets his way , 12.5 percent of germany ’ s overall energy output will come from renewable sources by the year 2012 , and 20 percent by the year 2020 , with costs falling year by year .
not everybody 's darling but those on the other side of the fence argue that the jobs come at a high price and ultimately the consumer has to pay the cost through subsidies .
there is also concern that wind turbines don ’ t always generate enough energy , and that some locations which have been selected as wind farm sites are too sheltered to be able to do the job properly .
and it is not only politicians who are opposed to the mass expansion of germany ’ s wind parks , there is also dissent in rural regions , where residents fear the charming countryside , and hence the tourist attraction , will be marred by what has been dubbed ‘ the asparagus effect ’ of the almost-trifid like constructions .

after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy . chancellor gerhard schröder met with economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party in an intimate ‘ energy summit ’ designed to take the wind out of a gusty debate on the future of germany ’ s national energy supply .
joined by the chairmen of the country ’ s main energy providers , enbw .
e.on , rwe and vattenfall , and representatives of the industrial concern thyssen krupp and chemical giant basf , the chancellor and his ministers rolled up their sleeves and discussed the fate of traditional energy sources such as coal and gas and alternative forms such as wind and solar .
the two-hour meeting had been preceded by an ongoing dispute between clement and trittin over germany ’ s energy mix and hefty subsidies for alternative power sources .
meeting environmental goals despite initial hesitancy and a spattering of criticism from both sides , the meeting was hailed a success .
although , as a government spokesman explained prior to the talks , the participants were not expecting any concrete resolutions , the word from those emerging from the chancellor ’ s office , was of a stimulating and constructive debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was conspicuously not invited to a meeting between schröder and the heads of the nation ’ s top four energy companies in the wake of the historic u.s. blackout last month , was evidently happy with thursday ’ s talks .
he told reporters that his views on emissions trading and climate protection had met with far-reaching agreement , although he added that the details had yet to be discussed .
emissions trading energy companies in germany are currently waiting for the government to announce the level of emissions rights they will be granted under the emissions trading system to be introduced in europe in 2005 .
the system , which creates financial incentives to reduce pollution in order to fulfil the reduction commitments assumed under the kyoto protocol , operates on the basis of allowance certificates .
if a company produces more emissions than its pollution allowance permits , it will be able to purchase rights from another company which does not exhaust its full allowance .
the incentive is for companies to generate as little carbon dioxide emissions as possible in order to sell off their unused allowance at a profit .
although germany is ahead of the rest of europe and has largely met its kyoto commitments , trittin is determined to see a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt on thursday , the environment minister said his stance was largely based on the commitment which german industry had imposed on itself .
will the sails keep turning ?
the other , albeit secondary issue , on the agenda at thursday ’ s talks still remains a point of conflict within the red-green coalition .
jürgen trittin a strong proponent of wind power and renewable energy sources , butted heads with wolfgang clement , who supports holding on to traditional energy sources .
clement has criticized the greens ’ overemphasis on wind energy and has said the wind parks sprouting across the land are at best " over subsidized " and at worst inefficient .
the green party and other supporters of renewable energy argue that not only do the giant wind turbines generate clean power and protect the environment , but that they also lead to the creation of almost 50,000 jobs .
there are currently 14,000 wind power generators operating in germany , more than anywhere else in the world , and if the environment minister gets his way , 12.5 percent of germany ’ s overall energy output will come from renewable sources by the year 2012 , and 20 percent by the year 2020 , with costs falling year by year .
not everybody 's darling but those on the other side of the fence argue that the jobs come at a high price and ultimately the consumer has to pay the cost through subsidies .
there is also concern that wind turbines don ’ t always generate enough energy , and that some locations which have been selected as wind farm sites are too sheltered to be able to do the job properly .
and it is not only politicians who are opposed to the mass expansion of germany ’ s wind parks , there is also dissent in rural regions , where residents fear the charming countryside , and hence the tourist attraction , will be marred by what has been dubbed ‘ the asparagus effect ’ of the almost-trifid like constructions .

the system , which creates financial incentives to reduce pollution in order to fulfil the reduction commitments assumed under the kyoto protocol , operates on the basis of allowance certificates .
if a company produces more emissions than its pollution allowance permits , it will be able to purchase rights from another company which does not exhaust its full allowance .
the incentive is for companies to generate as little carbon dioxide emissions as possible in order to sell off their unused allowance at a profit .
although germany is ahead of the rest of europe and has largely met its kyoto commitments , trittin is determined to see a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt on thursday , the environment minister said his stance was largely based on the commitment which german industry had imposed on itself .
will the sails keep turning ?
the other , albeit secondary issue , on the agenda at thursday ’ s talks still remains a point of conflict within the red-green coalition .
jürgen trittin a strong proponent of wind power and renewable energy sources , butted heads with wolfgang clement , who supports holding on to traditional energy sources .
clement has criticized the greens ’ overemphasis on wind energy and has said the wind parks sprouting across the land are at best " over subsidized " and at worst inefficient .
the green party and other supporters of renewable energy argue that not only do the giant wind turbines generate clean power and protect the environment , but that they also lead to the creation of almost 50,000 jobs .
there are currently 14,000 wind power generators operating in germany , more than anywhere else in the world , and if the environment minister gets his way , 12.5 percent of germany ’ s overall energy output will come from renewable sources by the year 2012 , and 20 percent by the year 2020 , with costs falling year by year .
not everybody 's darling but those on the other side of the fence argue that the jobs come at a high price and ultimately the consumer has to pay the cost through subsidies .
there is also concern that wind turbines don ’ t always generate enough energy , and that some locations which have been selected as wind farm sites are too sheltered to be able to do the job properly .
and it is not only politicians who are opposed to the mass expansion of germany ’ s wind parks , there is also dissent in rural regions , where residents fear the charming countryside , and hence the tourist attraction , will be marred by what has been dubbed ‘ the asparagus effect ’ of the almost-trifid like constructions .
to that trittin simply responded , " i don ’ t know what everybody has against asparagus .
it ’ s one of my favorite vegetables .

what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

however , no german troops will set foot in iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder declared in an interview on thursday that germany is prepared to train iraqi police and soldiers in the country ’ s first step towards helping to rebuild iraq .
the announcement , jointly published in the the wall street journal and german business daily handelsblatt , comes just days before the chancellor flies to new york for a meeting of the u.n. general assembly where he is expected to hold talks with u.s. president george w. bush on the sidelines .
as far as concessions go , germany ’ s decision should be accepted as a major breakthrough in the standoff with the united states which began towards the end of last year but exploded in acrimony over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in the spring .
although discussions between schröder and bush in new york have yet to be officially confirmed , the chancellor has prepared his olive branch in anticipation of talks that a german government spokesperson described as " very likely " to take place .
the meeting would herald the first face-to-face talks between the two leaders in more than a year .
germany is ready bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is ready .
“ germany is ready to help with the training of iraqi police , ” said schröder .
" iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present . "
training could take place in germany or elsewhere , he said , but it might be dangerous within iraq .
the chancellor added that the training would go ahead independently of any united nations resolution , indicating that the offer of training remained separate from the subject of troop deployments .
less such an offer of help be misinterpreted , defense minister peter struck reiterated on friday that it did not mean a shift towards the german military playing an active role in iraq .
with over 200,000 german troops already deployed abroad , “ there is no need for germany to station troops there , ” he said .
on the surface , schröder ’ s offer appears to be a compromise that suits both sides . his resolve that there will be no german military involvement in iraq without a new u.n. mandate remains intact while he hopes that the german move is gratefully accepted by washington which is struggling to convince the international community to assist in the continuously dangerous process of stabilizing post-war iraq .
either way , it is likely to reheat a relationship that has been distinctly icy of late .
germany , u.s. must win the peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush was not a happy man .
in an open letter published in the new york times on thursday , schröder wrote , “ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate .
we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ”
schröder also took the opportunity to pledge more german humanitarian support : “ in addition to its current military involvement in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere , germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces . ”
humanitarian aid certain heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for development and economic co-operation , echoed the chancellor ’ s pledge by saying in friday ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that germany ’ s commitment to aiding iraq , “ went without saying . ”
she added that germany wished to be involved in the donors conference in madrid in october , a pledging round organized by the spanish government in a bid to rally humanitarian support for iraq .
this news was treated with skepticism by german aid agencies which have recently called on the government to lay out guidelines for humanitarian work in iraq as the security situation in the country continues to decline .
fear for the safety of international aid agencies - which have pulled staff out of iraq since last month 's attack on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad - are overshadowing preparations for the pledging conference .
agencies have reservations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations headquarters in baghdad .
it is one thing for the government to pledge the support of the agencies but another to protect them while they are in iraq .

others believe that the aid organizations must first actually be in the country in order for the situation in iraq to improve .

there is no point in continuing this debate .

we must work together to win the peace . ”
schröder also took the opportunity to pledge more german humanitarian support : “ in addition to its current military involvement in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere , germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces . ”
humanitarian aid certain heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the federal minister for development and economic co-operation , echoed the chancellor ’ s pledge by saying in friday ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that germany ’ s commitment to aiding iraq , “ went without saying . ”
she added that germany wished to be involved in the donors conference in madrid in october , a pledging round organized by the spanish government in a bid to rally humanitarian support for iraq .
this news was treated with skepticism by german aid agencies which have recently called on the government to lay out guidelines for humanitarian work in iraq as the security situation in the country continues to decline .
fear for the safety of international aid agencies - which have pulled staff out of iraq since last month 's attack on the u.n. headquarters in baghdad - are overshadowing preparations for the pledging conference .

however , no german troops will set foot in iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder declared in an interview on thursday that germany is prepared to train iraqi police and soldiers in the country ’ s first step towards helping to rebuild iraq .
the announcement , jointly published in the the wall street journal and german business daily handelsblatt , comes just days before the chancellor flies to new york for a meeting of the u.n. general assembly where he is expected to hold talks with u.s. president george w. bush on the sidelines .
as far as concessions go , germany ’ s decision should be accepted as a major breakthrough in the standoff with the united states which began towards the end of last year but exploded in acrimony over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in the spring .
although discussions between schröder and bush in new york have yet to be officially confirmed , the chancellor has prepared his olive branch in anticipation of talks that a german government spokesperson described as " very likely " to take place .
the meeting would herald the first face-to-face talks between the two leaders in more than a year .
germany is ready bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is ready .
“ germany is ready to help with the training of iraqi police , ” said schröder .
" iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present . "
training could take place in germany or elsewhere , he said , but it might be dangerous within iraq .
the chancellor added that the training would go ahead independently of any united nations resolution , indicating that the offer of training remained separate from the subject of troop deployments .
less such an offer of help be misinterpreted , defense minister peter struck reiterated on friday that it did not mean a shift towards the german military playing an active role in iraq .
with over 200,000 german troops already deployed abroad , “ there is no need for germany to station troops there , ” he said .
on the surface , schröder ’ s offer appears to be a compromise that suits both sides . his resolve that there will be no german military involvement in iraq without a new u.n. mandate remains intact while he hopes that the german move is gratefully accepted by washington which is struggling to convince the international community to assist in the continuously dangerous process of stabilizing post-war iraq .
either way , it is likely to reheat a relationship that has been distinctly icy of late .

as the german open golf championship continues in glorious cologne sunshine , the inquisitive observer may look on with bemusement .
golf in germany ?
surely you mean the car … when asked a question that involves the words “ germany ” and “ golf ” , most people outside the country itself will automatically think of the popular volkswagen hatchback .
those with a little more knowledge of the sport which shares the same name as vw ’ s flagship motor may be able to combine the two terms and come up with the name of bernhard langer , germany ’ s double u.s. masters winner and golfing hall of fame resident .
few would be able to name a major golfing event which takes place in germany . however , germany plays home to one of the european tour ’ s main events once a season when the top players in the game come to gut lärchenhof near cologne to contest for prize money that totals € 3 million .
and this year , more people are likely to get to hear about it as the championship has already seen a european record after just one round of play . record breaking first day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernhard langer .
the 28-year-old swede fredrik jacobson wrote his name into the annals of european tour history on thursday when he completed his day ’ s work twelve shots under the recommended number players should take to get round the course .
jacobson ’ s 12 under par gave him the lead in the linde german masters but also made him only one of 10 players ever to complete a course in 60 shots on a european tour event . he very nearly broke all records when he arrived at his final challenge of the first day , the ninth hole , needing to complete the hole in one shot less than the par to record a round of 59 .
unfortunately , it was not to be and the swede equalled the european record instead of beating it . such feats may tweak the interest of the foreign enthusiast in the direction of germany for the duration of the tournament which ends on september 21 , but for the local golf fan , it is just one of the attractions of a sport that is growing in popularity across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pay and play or ride all day .
before bernhard langer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- success , there was n't much interest in golf in germany . now , however , the construction of over 100 new courses is a strong indication that the germans have taken a liking to the sport . the numbers of official golf clubs is on the rise , increasing three-fold since 1987 according to the german golf association .
germany ’ s official golf body boasts 622 clubs and 13 federal associations , and boasts more than 350,000 members . serious money members of association clubs usually have to possess a license called a platzreife which is awarded to a player who has taken a five-day course that involves several hours of training each day and a series of written and practical tests for the price of around € 300 . the platzreife is actually a legal requirement to play golf in registered clubs in germany , instituted over 40 years ago .
no other country in europe requires such a license , but german golfing associations say it is necessary to prevent unskilled players from holding up the games of others . however , there are other ways .
some german courses are semi-private , meaning visitors are welcome , although usually only monday through thursday and will cost the visitor € 60 for the privilege .
some other clubs cost somewhat less to play . # b # the cheaper priced courses reflect the fact that most german clubs still expect their golfers to walk with only a few of the bigger clubs providing motorized carts at prices that include their hire . tournaments for all for the adventurous golfer in germany , or the confident one , many german clubs offer the opportunity to take part in open tournaments to players outside their membership .
these tournaments are recommended to those who intend to spend the whole day at the club teeing off and putting away happily as they tend to be the same price or less than a usual day pass and include a meal , such as an awards dinner where formal attire is insisted upon . typical to the national mentality , the germans have taken to golf in a very technical way , focussing on the skill aspects of golf and spending a lot of time taking lessons and practicing , both on the range and on the course .
this has permeated into their well regimented and valued leisure time with a booming trade in hotels combining well-earned breaks with course passes becoming a country-wide phenomenon . so in germany , the old adage that , for many , golf is a pleasant walk spoiled could not be further from the truth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hosts most sporting events germany may not have the olympics and it may still have to wait a few years before hosting the world cup , but it 's ranked number one in the number of sporting events .

these tournaments are recommended to those who intend to spend the whole day at the club teeing off and putting away happily as they tend to be the same price or less than a usual day pass and include a meal , such as an awards dinner where formal attire is insisted upon . typical to the national mentality , the germans have taken to golf in a very technical way , focussing on the skill aspects of golf and spending a lot of time taking lessons and practicing , both on the range and on the course .
this has permeated into their well regimented and valued leisure time with a booming trade in hotels combining well-earned breaks with course passes becoming a country-wide phenomenon . so in germany , the old adage that , for many , golf is a pleasant walk spoiled could not be further from the truth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hosts most sporting events germany may not have the olympics and it may still have to wait a few years before hosting the world cup , but it 's ranked number one in the number of sporting events .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2003 beer frenzy in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prost !
visitors to the oktoberfest drink an average 5 liters of beer beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
one of these , and probably the most significant , is the annual oktoberfest .
the festival , which traditionally begins on the 21st of september , attracts more than six million visitors each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waitresses in the traditional bavarian " dirndl " swing their mugs and dance among the crowd .
it is said to be the largest public bash in the world .
in just 14 days , visitors consume more than five million liters of beer and up to 200,000 pork sausages .
an impressive 14 specially constructed giant " beer tents " with room for an average 7,000 drinkers are put up by munich 's breweries for the event , which begins when the first keg is tapped in the so-called schottenhammel tent .
a long-time tradition , the mayor personally ' taps ' the first barrel of beer and shouts " o 'zapft is ! " -lrb- the keg is tapped -rrb- .
then the festivities begin . dancing on tables bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer mugs on a table in a beer tent at the oktoberfest in munich , bavaria .
with the keg tapping over , the ' fest ' can begin .
as the beer flows freely and long trestle tables groan under the weight of the huge , heavy one-liter mugs and impromptu dancing begins on slippery table tops , dedicated oktoberfest fans start setting up camp on the surrounding fields .
for many , the festivity lasts for several days , beginning when the first tents open at ten , until long into the cool , late summer night . despite its name , the oktoberfest actually kicks off in september , since the chances of the weather cooperating are greater .
the reasons for the festival 's name lie in its origins .
it all began with the celebrated marriage on october 12 , 1810 of the bavarian crown prince ludwig -lrb- later known as ludwig the first -rrb- to princess therese from the german kingdom of saxony-hildburghausen , who gave her name to the theresienwiese , where the oktoberfest takes place .
after such a successful party , it was decided that the celebrations should take place every year . less visitors , more fun ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beer mug full of euros - the oktoberfest is a major money-making event in munich .
today , visitor numbers are declining but oktoberfest is still a major event on the german calendar .
not just in a cultural sense : an average € 1 billion rolls into the registers of breweries , taxis and hotels during the two weeks of the festival .
however , competition is growing .
already , there is a smaller , yet just as beery oktoberfest which takes place at the same time in berlin .
and this year , londoners do n't need to go far to get a taste of their favorite bavarian brew : instead , they can stay at home and enjoy their first , very own london-based bavarian-style beer ' fest ' . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .
but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the wiesn . -lrb- june 9 , 03 -rrb- germany 's favorite beverage : beer dw-world has compiled a collection of stories on what the brew actually means to a nation of die-hard beer-worshippers .

after weeks of discord in germany ’ s coalition government over the future of the nation ’ s energy supply , ministers from both camps are working together to reach a compromise on traditional and renewable forms of energy . chancellor gerhard schröder met with economics minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin of the green party in an intimate ‘ energy summit ’ designed to take the wind out of a gusty debate on the future of germany ’ s national energy supply .
joined by the chairmen of the country ’ s main energy providers , enbw .
e.on , rwe and vattenfall , and representatives of the industrial concern thyssen krupp and chemical giant basf , the chancellor and his ministers rolled up their sleeves and discussed the fate of traditional energy sources such as coal and gas and alternative forms such as wind and solar .
the two-hour meeting had been preceded by an ongoing dispute between clement and trittin over germany ’ s energy mix and hefty subsidies for alternative power sources .
meeting environmental goals despite initial hesitancy and a spattering of criticism from both sides , the meeting was hailed a success .
although , as a government spokesman explained prior to the talks , the participants were not expecting any concrete resolutions , the word from those emerging from the chancellor ’ s office , was of a stimulating and constructive debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was conspicuously not invited to a meeting between schröder and the heads of the nation ’ s top four energy companies in the wake of the historic u.s. blackout last month , was evidently happy with thursday ’ s talks .
he told reporters that his views on emissions trading and climate protection had met with far-reaching agreement , although he added that the details had yet to be discussed .
emissions trading energy companies in germany are currently waiting for the government to announce the level of emissions rights they will be granted under the emissions trading system to be introduced in europe in 2005 .
the system , which creates financial incentives to reduce pollution in order to fulfil the reduction commitments assumed under the kyoto protocol , operates on the basis of allowance certificates .
if a company produces more emissions than its pollution allowance permits , it will be able to purchase rights from another company which does not exhaust its full allowance .
the incentive is for companies to generate as little carbon dioxide emissions as possible in order to sell off their unused allowance at a profit .
although germany is ahead of the rest of europe and has largely met its kyoto commitments , trittin is determined to see a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 .
in an interview with the german newspaper handelsblatt on thursday , the environment minister said his stance was largely based on the commitment which german industry had imposed on itself .
will the sails keep turning ?
the other , albeit secondary issue , on the agenda at thursday ’ s talks still remains a point of conflict within the red-green coalition .
jürgen trittin a strong proponent of wind power and renewable energy sources , butted heads with wolfgang clement , who supports holding on to traditional energy sources .
clement has criticized the greens ’ overemphasis on wind energy and has said the wind parks sprouting across the land are at best " over subsidized " and at worst inefficient .
the green party and other supporters of renewable energy argue that not only do the giant wind turbines generate clean power and protect the environment , but that they also lead to the creation of almost 50,000 jobs .
there are currently 14,000 wind power generators operating in germany , more than anywhere else in the world , and if the environment minister gets his way , 12.5 percent of germany ’ s overall energy output will come from renewable sources by the year 2012 , and 20 percent by the year 2020 , with costs falling year by year .
not everybody 's darling but those on the other side of the fence argue that the jobs come at a high price and ultimately the consumer has to pay the cost through subsidies .
there is also concern that wind turbines don ’ t always generate enough energy , and that some locations which have been selected as wind farm sites are too sheltered to be able to do the job properly .
and it is not only politicians who are opposed to the mass expansion of germany ’ s wind parks , there is also dissent in rural regions , where residents fear the charming countryside , and hence the tourist attraction , will be marred by what has been dubbed ‘ the asparagus effect ’ of the almost-trifid like constructions .
to that trittin simply responded , " i don ’ t know what everybody has against asparagus .
it ’ s one of my favorite vegetables .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.09.2003 left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé maria aznar -lrb- left -rrb- and silvio berlusconi have n't been invited to saturday 's summit in berlin .
though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is . officially , there haven ’ t been any complaints .
but behind the scenes , the decision not to invite the leaders of spain and italy to saturday ’ s iraq summit in berlin has roiled the chattering classes in madrid and rome .
though the governments of the mediterranean countries aren ’ t expressing it , observers say they feel left out .
at their meeting on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair will seek to end the rift that has lasted for months between the countries on the iraq question .
that ’ s all well and good , but major newspapers in spain and italy have complained in editorials that the exclusion of spanish prime minister josé maria aznar and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is a form of punishment from german and france for those leaders ' steadfast support of u.s. president george w. bush 's hawkishness .
deliberately excluded ?
describing the snub as an " affront " to spain , the influential el mundo wrote that " it ’ s obvious the leaders of germany and france have deliberately excluded " spanish prime minister josé maria aznar .
" more than any other european country spain should have been at this meeting " because of its support for us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair and its role as a un security council member , the paper wrote .
madrid has already contributed € 81.9 million to the u.s.-led war effort in iraq , and the defense ministry estimates the country ’ s contributions to the reconstruction of iraq could reach € 170 million .
" how long , " the paper asked , " are paris and berlin going to punish aznar for his pro-american stance ? "
el mundo also wrote that aznar ’ s snub may also have been influenced by his recent criticism of france for failing to do more to reign in its deficit spending .
earlier this month , french officials admitted the country would exceed the 3 percent ceiling in deficit spending required by the stability and growth pact that guarantees the strength of the euro for the third year in a row .
aznar ’ s criticisms also drew a rebuke from german chancellor gerhard schröder , who reminded the spaniards that their own economic growth has been fueled by eu subsidies – 25 percent of which are funded by berlin .
another major spanish paper , el periodico , opined that " jose maria aznar is starting to pay for his unconditional support of president bush ’ s warlike strategy .
chancellor schröder has excluded him from the berlin summit . "
the paper also noted that aznar was unable to paper over his differences with france over the iraq war at a recent meeting with chirac .
and the country ’ s unofficial paper of record , el pais , said the development showed aznar " finds himself marginalized on major negotiations " over iraq .
criticism has also been strong in italy , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union .
rome ’ s la repubblica opined this week that berlusconi ’ s exclusion suggested that italy was losing its diplomatic importance .
playing down the tensions still , politicians in both countries have sought to play down the significance of their exclusion .
italian foreign minister franco frattini characterized the berlin meeting as an " informal meal , " and aznar has taken pains to point out that he will be meeting in london with blair one day after the meeting and that he has discussed the iraq resolution with both chirac and berlusconi .
" not everybody is invited everywhere , " spanish foreign minister ana palacio told reporters in madrid .
" it is a working meeting proposed by german so that france and the united kingdom - two key states in the construction of europe - can overcome certain positions that they have had at one time or another . "
a spokesman for tony blair said on tuesday that he valued his contacts with aznar and other european leaders " as much as he valued his contacts with chancellor schröder and president chirac . "
and a report in the british newspaper the guardian suggested that blair had argued unsuccessfully in favor of inviting aznar to the meeting .
meanwhile , german government spokesman bela anda also sought to play down the decision not to invite italy or spain to the informal meeting , saying the meeting was " not directed against anyone . "
additionally , the leaders of germany , britain and france have also contacted other eu member states to discuss the meeting , but have not extended invitations to any other countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , chirac , blair to seek deal on iraq the leaders of france , germany and great britain are meeting in berlin on saturday .

though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is . officially , there haven ’ t been any complaints .
but behind the scenes , the decision not to invite the leaders of spain and italy to saturday ’ s iraq summit in berlin has roiled the chattering classes in madrid and rome .
though the governments of the mediterranean countries aren ’ t expressing it , observers say they feel left out .
at their meeting on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair will seek to end the rift that has lasted for months between the countries on the iraq question .
that ’ s all well and good , but major newspapers in spain and italy have complained in editorials that the exclusion of spanish prime minister josé maria aznar and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is a form of punishment from german and france for those leaders ' steadfast support of u.s. president george w. bush 's hawkishness .
deliberately excluded ?
describing the snub as an " affront " to spain , the influential el mundo wrote that " it ’ s obvious the leaders of germany and france have deliberately excluded " spanish prime minister josé maria aznar .
" more than any other european country spain should have been at this meeting " because of its support for us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair and its role as a un security council member , the paper wrote .
madrid has already contributed € 81.9 million to the u.s.-led war effort in iraq , and the defense ministry estimates the country ’ s contributions to the reconstruction of iraq could reach € 170 million .
" how long , " the paper asked , " are paris and berlin going to punish aznar for his pro-american stance ? "
el mundo also wrote that aznar ’ s snub may also have been influenced by his recent criticism of france for failing to do more to reign in its deficit spending .
earlier this month , french officials admitted the country would exceed the 3 percent ceiling in deficit spending required by the stability and growth pact that guarantees the strength of the euro for the third year in a row .
aznar ’ s criticisms also drew a rebuke from german chancellor gerhard schröder , who reminded the spaniards that their own economic growth has been fueled by eu subsidies – 25 percent of which are funded by berlin .
another major spanish paper , el periodico , opined that " jose maria aznar is starting to pay for his unconditional support of president bush ’ s warlike strategy .
chancellor schröder has excluded him from the berlin summit . "
the paper also noted that aznar was unable to paper over his differences with france over the iraq war at a recent meeting with chirac .
and the country ’ s unofficial paper of record , el pais , said the development showed aznar " finds himself marginalized on major negotiations " over iraq .
criticism has also been strong in italy , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union .
rome ’ s la repubblica opined this week that berlusconi ’ s exclusion suggested that italy was losing its diplomatic importance .
playing down the tensions still , politicians in both countries have sought to play down the significance of their exclusion .
italian foreign minister franco frattini characterized the berlin meeting as an " informal meal , " and aznar has taken pains to point out that he will be meeting in london with blair one day after the meeting and that he has discussed the iraq resolution with both chirac and berlusconi .
" not everybody is invited everywhere , " spanish foreign minister ana palacio told reporters in madrid .
" it is a working meeting proposed by german so that france and the united kingdom - two key states in the construction of europe - can overcome certain positions that they have had at one time or another . "
a spokesman for tony blair said on tuesday that he valued his contacts with aznar and other european leaders " as much as he valued his contacts with chancellor schröder and president chirac . "
and a report in the british newspaper the guardian suggested that blair had argued unsuccessfully in favor of inviting aznar to the meeting .
meanwhile , german government spokesman bela anda also sought to play down the decision not to invite italy or spain to the informal meeting , saying the meeting was " not directed against anyone . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.09.2003 left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josé maria aznar -lrb- left -rrb- and silvio berlusconi have n't been invited to saturday 's summit in berlin .
though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is . officially , there haven ’ t been any complaints .
but behind the scenes , the decision not to invite the leaders of spain and italy to saturday ’ s iraq summit in berlin has roiled the chattering classes in madrid and rome .
though the governments of the mediterranean countries aren ’ t expressing it , observers say they feel left out .
at their meeting on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair will seek to end the rift that has lasted for months between the countries on the iraq question .
that ’ s all well and good , but major newspapers in spain and italy have complained in editorials that the exclusion of spanish prime minister josé maria aznar and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is a form of punishment from german and france for those leaders ' steadfast support of u.s. president george w. bush 's hawkishness .
deliberately excluded ?
describing the snub as an " affront " to spain , the influential el mundo wrote that " it ’ s obvious the leaders of germany and france have deliberately excluded " spanish prime minister josé maria aznar .
" more than any other european country spain should have been at this meeting " because of its support for us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair and its role as a un security council member , the paper wrote .
madrid has already contributed € 81.9 million to the u.s.-led war effort in iraq , and the defense ministry estimates the country ’ s contributions to the reconstruction of iraq could reach € 170 million .
" how long , " the paper asked , " are paris and berlin going to punish aznar for his pro-american stance ? "
el mundo also wrote that aznar ’ s snub may also have been influenced by his recent criticism of france for failing to do more to reign in its deficit spending .
earlier this month , french officials admitted the country would exceed the 3 percent ceiling in deficit spending required by the stability and growth pact that guarantees the strength of the euro for the third year in a row .
aznar ’ s criticisms also drew a rebuke from german chancellor gerhard schröder , who reminded the spaniards that their own economic growth has been fueled by eu subsidies – 25 percent of which are funded by berlin .
another major spanish paper , el periodico , opined that " jose maria aznar is starting to pay for his unconditional support of president bush ’ s warlike strategy .
chancellor schröder has excluded him from the berlin summit . "
the paper also noted that aznar was unable to paper over his differences with france over the iraq war at a recent meeting with chirac .
and the country ’ s unofficial paper of record , el pais , said the development showed aznar " finds himself marginalized on major negotiations " over iraq .
criticism has also been strong in italy , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union .
rome ’ s la repubblica opined this week that berlusconi ’ s exclusion suggested that italy was losing its diplomatic importance .

a court has handed down a ruling calling for josef ackermann , the chief of deutsche bank to be tried on charges of dishonest behavior relating to vodaphone 's 2000 takeover of mannesmann . a regional court in düsseldorf has ruled to admit charges of fraud against josef ackermann , the swiss-born chief executive of deutsche bank . ackermann and five others were charged in february with fraud relating to the 2000 takeover of the german mobile phone giant mannesmann by its british rival vodafone .
the case has since become known as the " mannesmann affair . " a spokesman for the court declined to comment on the case , stating that those affected had to be notified first . payments for takeover approval ? according to the 580-page document outlining the charges , which was released in february , ackermann and five others authorized what have been described by some observers as " bribery " payments to help facilitate the takeover . klaus esser , the then-chief executive of mannesmann , received payments and bonuses totaling more than € 58 million that are now the subject of scrutiny .
according to the allegations , these payments - a € 15 million " appreciation award " and € 43 million in other payments - were given to mr. esser so that he would drop his objections to the € 175 million takeover of mannesmann by vodafone , the largest in corporate history . ackermann and five others , including former ig metall chief klaus zwickel , are said to have approved the payments as members of the compensation committee of mannesmann 's supervisory board . a trial could have far-reaching implications for german business .
though germany has one of the smallest pay differentials between board members and average employees , a trial could prompt a debate about corporate compensation , which could henceforth make them subject to drastic limitations .
some experts have warned that such a move would make it difficult for multi-national firms to operate from germany . deutsche bank stands by its man deutsche bank , in a statement released on friday , came to the defense of its embattled chief executive , stating that ackermann has the full support of deutsche bank 's board of directors and its supervisory board .
a spokesman for the bank said management was convinced that ackermann behaved correctly and appropriately during the mannesmann takeover and the allegations were baseless .
according to the statement , ackermann " would defend himself with the utmost force . " ackermann has denied the charges .
in a note released to deutsche bank 's staff a day after the charges were filed in february , eberhard kempf , ackermann 's defense lawyer , said the indictment was groundless and based on a weak legal argument which rested on questionable evidence .
kempf wrote : " the indictment ultimately fails to state where there is supposed to be a serious breach of corporate law duties , which is the precondition for a breach of trust .

it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq . in a sign that relations between the two countries are on the mend , german chancellor gerhard schröder will meet with u.s. president george w. bush for private talks on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly on wednesday . schröder will arrive with several offers of help that many hope will put german-american relations on the road to normalization .
schröder has said germany is prepared to help train iraqi police , educate the iraqi military and help finance infrastructure projects involving german companies in iraq . schröder told the handelsblatt newspaper that the offers were independent of any u.n. resolution on post-war reconstruction in iraq . “ iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present , ” he told the newspaper . the chancellor warned however , that germany ’ s budget is tight and that financial contributions to iraq will be moderate .
“ we have no plans to offer money , ” he said . staying on message schröder will be attempting to strike a delicate balance during the talks with bush .
while the chancellor wants germany to be seen as a partner to the u.s. , he needs to avoid running the risk of seeming to justify or support bush ’ s position on iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the government , schröder ’ s position on iraq has not changed , and officials insist the chancellor is not going to new york to “ give in ” in any way . “ it ’ s not about concessions , ” karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german government , told reuters .
“ it ’ s about changing the environment . ” schröder goes to the u.s. in a somewhat stronger position , given that george w. bush is in a weaker one .
the u.s. president has come under increasing pressure , particularly at home , as u.s. peacekeepers in iraq face rising instability on the ground and near-daily american casualties , while the price tag for the war spirals out of control . but schröder appears to be avoiding any public expression of schadenfreude .
as he told the handelsblatt , it is time to look forward . “ those who favored the war - and that does n't mean just the u.s. , but also great britain and other european countries as well as those who , for considerable reasons , opposed it , must now all accept their common responsibility , ” he said . any country which stays on the sidelines , he said , “ is making a mistake . ” still , schröder has insisted that german participation in iraq will be limited to civilian reconstruction efforts or training programs .
germany , he warned , “ can not participate in any military action in iraq . ” “ now it ’ s all about reconstructing iraq , not about a military engagement that we are not considering and for which we have no plans , ” schröder said . let bygones be bygones the relationship between berlin and washington turned frosty ever since schröder ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
schröder , along with french president jacques chirac , was at the head of an anti-war coalition in the build-up to military action against saddam hussein .
bush was incensed that schröder used his critique of u.s. foreign policy to help get reelected last year . but lately , both sides have shown signs that the deep freeze in ties has begun to thaw .

he has said germany will deploy troops in the northern city of kunduz .
germany currently provides the largest contingent of troops in afghanistan , 1,800 out of 4,000 soldiers . bush nodded in schröder ’ s direction last month by praising the plan .
“ i look forward to thanking chancellor schröder for that , ” bush said at the time . when schröder was told in the interview that u.s. officials consider the meeting a chance for the two leaders to “ bury the hatchet , ” he responded by saying he hadn ’ t been waving any hatchet . “ the press has also greatly exaggerated -lrb- the problems in our relationship -rrb- , ” he said .

gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .
it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq . in a sign that relations between the two countries are on the mend , german chancellor gerhard schröder will meet with u.s. president george w. bush for private talks on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly on wednesday . schröder will arrive with several offers of help that many hope will put german-american relations on the road to normalization .
schröder has said germany is prepared to help train iraqi police , educate the iraqi military and help finance infrastructure projects involving german companies in iraq . schröder told the handelsblatt newspaper that the offers were independent of any u.n. resolution on post-war reconstruction in iraq . “ iraqi military could also be trained in our army colleges .
and of course , we would also pay for this , as we do everywhere we are present , ” he told the newspaper . the chancellor warned however , that germany ’ s budget is tight and that financial contributions to iraq will be moderate .
“ we have no plans to offer money , ” he said . staying on message schröder will be attempting to strike a delicate balance during the talks with bush .
while the chancellor wants germany to be seen as a partner to the u.s. , he needs to avoid running the risk of seeming to justify or support bush ’ s position on iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the government , schröder ’ s position on iraq has not changed , and officials insist the chancellor is not going to new york to “ give in ” in any way . “ it ’ s not about concessions , ” karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german government , told reuters .
“ it ’ s about changing the environment . ” schröder goes to the u.s. in a somewhat stronger position , given that george w. bush is in a weaker one .
the u.s. president has come under increasing pressure , particularly at home , as u.s. peacekeepers in iraq face rising instability on the ground and near-daily american casualties , while the price tag for the war spirals out of control . but schröder appears to be avoiding any public expression of schadenfreude .
as he told the handelsblatt , it is time to look forward . “ those who favored the war - and that does n't mean just the u.s. , but also great britain and other european countries as well as those who , for considerable reasons , opposed it , must now all accept their common responsibility , ” he said . any country which stays on the sidelines , he said , “ is making a mistake . ” still , schröder has insisted that german participation in iraq will be limited to civilian reconstruction efforts or training programs .
germany , he warned , “ can not participate in any military action in iraq . ” “ now it ’ s all about reconstructing iraq , not about a military engagement that we are not considering and for which we have no plans , ” schröder said . let bygones be bygones the relationship between berlin and washington turned frosty ever since schröder ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
schröder , along with french president jacques chirac , was at the head of an anti-war coalition in the build-up to military action against saddam hussein .
bush was incensed that schröder used his critique of u.s. foreign policy to help get reelected last year . but lately , both sides have shown signs that the deep freeze in ties has begun to thaw .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.09.2003 beer frenzy in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prost !
visitors to the oktoberfest drink an average 5 liters of beer beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
one of these , and probably the most significant , is the annual oktoberfest .
the festival , which traditionally begins on the 21st of september , attracts more than six million visitors each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waitresses in the traditional bavarian " dirndl " swing their mugs and dance among the crowd .
it is said to be the largest public bash in the world .
in just 14 days , visitors consume more than five million liters of beer and up to 200,000 pork sausages .
an impressive 14 specially constructed giant " beer tents " with room for an average 7,000 drinkers are put up by munich 's breweries for the event , which begins when the first keg is tapped in the so-called schottenhammel tent .
a long-time tradition , the mayor personally ' taps ' the first barrel of beer and shouts " o 'zapft is ! " -lrb- the keg is tapped -rrb- .
then the festivities begin . dancing on tables bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer mugs on a table in a beer tent at the oktoberfest in munich , bavaria .

as the beer flows freely and long trestle tables groan under the weight of the huge , heavy one-liter mugs and impromptu dancing begins on slippery table tops , dedicated oktoberfest fans start setting up camp on the surrounding fields .
for many , the festivity lasts for several days , beginning when the first tents open at ten , until long into the cool , late summer night . despite its name , the oktoberfest actually kicks off in september , since the chances of the weather cooperating are greater .
the reasons for the festival 's name lie in its origins .
it all began with the celebrated marriage on october 12 , 1810 of the bavarian crown prince ludwig -lrb- later known as ludwig the first -rrb- to princess therese from the german kingdom of saxony-hildburghausen , who gave her name to the theresienwiese , where the oktoberfest takes place .

not just in a cultural sense : an average € 1 billion rolls into the registers of breweries , taxis and hotels during the two weeks of the festival .
however , competition is growing .
already , there is a smaller , yet just as beery oktoberfest which takes place at the same time in berlin .

a court has handed down a ruling calling for josef ackermann , the chief of deutsche bank to be tried on charges of dishonest behavior relating to vodaphone 's 2000 takeover of mannesmann . a regional court in düsseldorf has ruled to admit charges of fraud against josef ackermann , the swiss-born chief executive of deutsche bank . ackermann and five others were charged in february with fraud relating to the 2000 takeover of the german mobile phone giant mannesmann by its british rival vodafone .
the case has since become known as the " mannesmann affair . " a spokesman for the court declined to comment on the case , stating that those affected had to be notified first . payments for takeover approval ? according to the 580-page document outlining the charges , which was released in february , ackermann and five others authorized what have been described by some observers as " bribery " payments to help facilitate the takeover . klaus esser , the then-chief executive of mannesmann , received payments and bonuses totaling more than € 58 million that are now the subject of scrutiny .
according to the allegations , these payments - a € 15 million " appreciation award " and € 43 million in other payments - were given to mr. esser so that he would drop his objections to the € 175 million takeover of mannesmann by vodafone , the largest in corporate history . ackermann and five others , including former ig metall chief klaus zwickel , are said to have approved the payments as members of the compensation committee of mannesmann 's supervisory board . a trial could have far-reaching implications for german business .
though germany has one of the smallest pay differentials between board members and average employees , a trial could prompt a debate about corporate compensation , which could henceforth make them subject to drastic limitations .
some experts have warned that such a move would make it difficult for multi-national firms to operate from germany . deutsche bank stands by its man deutsche bank , in a statement released on friday , came to the defense of its embattled chief executive , stating that ackermann has the full support of deutsche bank 's board of directors and its supervisory board .
a spokesman for the bank said management was convinced that ackermann behaved correctly and appropriately during the mannesmann takeover and the allegations were baseless .
according to the statement , ackermann " would defend himself with the utmost force . " ackermann has denied the charges .
in a note released to deutsche bank 's staff a day after the charges were filed in february , eberhard kempf , ackermann 's defense lawyer , said the indictment was groundless and based on a weak legal argument which rested on questionable evidence .
kempf wrote : " the indictment ultimately fails to state where there is supposed to be a serious breach of corporate law duties , which is the precondition for a breach of trust .

the comments came as the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- launched a staffing study calling for co-ordinated action from the uk 's four health departments .
according to the report , the number of qualified nurses in scotland has grown by less than 5 % since 1999 , compared with an increase of 11 % in england , 8 % in wales and 6 % in northern ireland .
the rcn 's key recommendation is for the primary focus of recruitment activity to be concentrated within the uk , as opposed to overseas .
i am angry and frustrated with the progress being made on the nursing workforce in scotland james kennedy rcn scotland the union believes this will ensure that the uk 's nursing workforce continues to grow over the next decade .
the report , more nurses working differently ? , found that despite the increase in nursing staff , nursing shortages have not yet been solved .
james kennedy , rcn scotland secretary , added : " i am angry and frustrated with the progress being made on the nursing workforce in scotland compared with other parts of the uk .
" the number of whole time equivalent qualified nurses in scotland has grown by less than 5 % since 1999 , compared with over 11 % in england . "
nursing target " financial pressures are also impacting on frontline staff , with many areas freezing their plans to recruit more nurses .
" given this situation i find it impossible to see how the executive can achieve its target of 12,000 more nurses by 2007 .
" it is little wonder that most nurses in scotland today feel that their workload is too heavy . "
the report , commissioned by the rcn , provides an overview of the uk nursing labour market , as well as the main changes influencing supply and demand of nurses and trends in the nursing workforce .
nurse shortages are causing concern tracy mcfall , rcn scotland chairwoman , said that while the number of students starting courses in scotland was increasing , the number completing their studies and entering the profession had fallen by almost 30 % in the last decade .
" we believe we are losing more students than any other part of the uk , our workforce is growing more slowly and one in 10 nurses in scotland will reach retirement age in the next five years , " she said .
health minister malcolm chisholm said he was confident that the 12,000 target would be met by 2007 .
" the number of extra qualified nurses in the workforce has increased far more dramatically over the last two years than previously but i accept we still have much more to do , " he said .
mr chisholm added : " we are working very hard to improve things for nurses in scotland in relation to the hours and shift patterns they can work .
" other initiatives include return to practice programmes to encourage nurses back into the workforce after a career break and £ 1.75m invested in continuous professional development for nurses . "

the comments came as the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- launched a staffing study calling for co-ordinated action from the uk 's four health departments .
according to the report , the number of qualified nurses in scotland has grown by less than 5 % since 1999 , compared with an increase of 11 % in england , 8 % in wales and 6 % in northern ireland .
the rcn 's key recommendation is for the primary focus of recruitment activity to be concentrated within the uk , as opposed to overseas .
i am angry and frustrated with the progress being made on the nursing workforce in scotland james kennedy rcn scotland the union believes this will ensure that the uk 's nursing workforce continues to grow over the next decade .
the report , more nurses working differently ? , found that despite the increase in nursing staff , nursing shortages have not yet been solved .
james kennedy , rcn scotland secretary , added : " i am angry and frustrated with the progress being made on the nursing workforce in scotland compared with other parts of the uk .
" the number of whole time equivalent qualified nurses in scotland has grown by less than 5 % since 1999 , compared with over 11 % in england . "
nursing target " financial pressures are also impacting on frontline staff , with many areas freezing their plans to recruit more nurses .
" given this situation i find it impossible to see how the executive can achieve its target of 12,000 more nurses by 2007 .
" it is little wonder that most nurses in scotland today feel that their workload is too heavy . "
the report , commissioned by the rcn , provides an overview of the uk nursing labour market , as well as the main changes influencing supply and demand of nurses and trends in the nursing workforce .
nurse shortages are causing concern tracy mcfall , rcn scotland chairwoman , said that while the number of students starting courses in scotland was increasing , the number completing their studies and entering the profession had fallen by almost 30 % in the last decade .
" we believe we are losing more students than any other part of the uk , our workforce is growing more slowly and one in 10 nurses in scotland will reach retirement age in the next five years , " she said .
health minister malcolm chisholm said he was confident that the 12,000 target would be met by 2007 .
" the number of extra qualified nurses in the workforce has increased far more dramatically over the last two years than previously but i accept we still have much more to do , " he said .

professor marsh said that calculations on how much smokers cost the country compared to how much revenue the government gets from cigarette taxes , could go on forever .
click here to see our interview with professor marsh looking simply at the cost / revenue figures , then smokers contribute more than they cost - the cost of treating them on the nhs for smoking-related diseases is less than the amount of money the government gets from taxes .
but professor marsh pointed out that this ignores the economic contributions that those people would have continued to make , if they had not become ill and died .
then , if you carry on calculating purely on figures you need to take into account that those same people , because they 're dead , are unable to collect their pensions .

we all know in a vague way that smoking is bad for your health .
but did you realise that half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by the habit ?
smokers face a higher risk than non-smokers for many diseases , from cervical cancer to angina .
but the big three killers for smokers are lung cancer , coronary heart disease and chronic bronchitis and emphysaema .
each year , around 120,000 people in this country die from smoking related diseases - and a quarter of those deaths are in middle age .
if you 're still smoking in your thirties and forties , you 're five times more likely to have a heart attack than a non-smoker .
you may have other reasons for giving up .
if money is tight , remember that a twenty a day habit costs you around £ 35 a week - which could go very nicely towards buying a new outfit or having a good night out .
you might also find that other people do n't appreciate the smell of smoke which comes with you wherever you go .
or they may not want to expose their children to your smoke .
how to give up there are many different methods of giving up smoking , from hypnotism to nicotine patches , to willpower alone .
twelve million people in britain have managed to give up , so remember - however bad it is - you 're not alone .
the charity quitline says it 's helped two million people give up smoking in this country .
it has a confidential telephone counselling service and also offers same day advice by e-mail .

quitline 's phone number is 0800 00 22 00 the nhs national smoking helpline will put you in touch with local services in your area : 0800 1690169 .

it comes after the firm ordered urgent checks on all its north sea platforms following the deaths of two workers .
the oilc union said the brent charlie platform has been patched in 47 places , 21 of which were leaking , with seven leaking hydrocarbons .
last week sean mccue , 22 , of kennoway in fife , and keith moncrieff , 45 , of invergowrie , tayside , were overcome by gas while working on patched pipework in a leg of the brent bravo platform .
the company said a number of factors led to the tragedy , which were unlikely to combine again .
we have standards around how much these patches can leak and none of these patches are at risk greg hill shell expro but all platform managers have now been ordered to re-check the integrity of pipework repairs and certain valves .
greg hill , production director of shell ep europe , told bbc radio scotland that the platform was safe .
he said : " patches are an industry standard way of repairing pipework , we monitor all of our patches through a patch register and none of the patches on charlie are safety critical - if they were critical they would be dealt with .
" we have standards around how much these patches can leak and none of these patches are at risk . "
the offshore union oilc said it had been raising concerns about patched pipework on shell platforms for more than three years and had been given countless reassurances about their safety .
general secretary jake molloy said it was clear assurances were unfounded .
mr molloy is still calling on the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- to be " far more proactive " in ensuring industry maintenance procedures are followed .
danger concerns the hse confirmed it had served a prohibition order on shell expro 's brent bravo installation .
the company said it had also brought forward a planned maintenance shutdown on the brent charlie platform to carry out checks and repairs , but mr molloy said his members still had concerns .
