german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .

german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .

at a time when a war-related decline in business travel has prompted lufthansa to ground 55 of its planes , the continued rise of low-cost airlines bucks the trend .
but how ? low-cost airlines are calm and composed in the face of a war in iraq : although major airlines around the world are fighting for survival -lrb- air canada just declared bankruptcy and american airlines has - thus far - narrowly avoided such a move -rrb- , their discount-minded cousins are selling just as many tickets as before the war . " the war has n't interfered with business at all , " a spokeswoman for high-flying budget carrier ryanair told the german press agency dpa . the reason is simple . low-cost airlines operate primarily in europe 's vacation destinations and they are profiting from an increased trend in city tourism .
they are also benefiting from a thrifty streak among business travelers , the life blood of the majors , who used to pay top dollar for seats .
but those days are now passé .
while the major airlines are experiencing a sharp decline in business traffic , the number of business travelers on hapag-loyd express , the low-cost subsidiary of tui , has risen by 40 percent . clear skies ahead for low-cost carriers top brass at germanwings , air berlin , and europe 's largest low-cost provider , ryanair , are all singing the same song of success while at the same time predicting more to come .

11th may have sparked the biggest industry crisis in recent memory - one which has cost over a million jobs so far - but , year after year , low-cost airlines are reporting ever-increasing numbers of passengers .
and this trend , according to recent figures , has not been interrupted by the latest wave of hostilities in iraq . " our bookings are now back at the same level they were at before the war broke out , " a spokesman for hapag lloyd express told dpa . germanwings , a subsidiary of eurowings , has sold over a million tickets since launching last october .
the company has seen little difference in ticket sales since the war broke out .
" people have been booking with shorter notice , but the war has n't had any noticeable effects , " a germanwings spokesman told dpa . air berlin is contemplating placing a major order with boeing or airbus for 40 new planes and its passenger load increased 20 percent in 2002 , rising to 6.7 million -lrb- the company predicts the number will increase to 8.3 million by the end of this year -rrb- . ryanair setting the pace ryanair , the super-successful irish outfit that sets the pace for budget competitors across europe , expanded in the german market , adding niederrhein and berlin to its list of german destinations , joining hahn in hunsrück , lübeck and friedrichshafen .
what 's more , ryanair announced in january it would begin operating a fourth european hub in stockholm-stavsta -lrb- with 30 flights throughout europe -rrb- and is in discussions with seven airports to open yet another .
this has led to a 40 percent rise - to a total of 15 million - in the number of passengers flying with ryanair .
and company execs have their eyes on a bigger prize : they predict a passenger load of 40 million by 2013 - more than doubling their current load in 10 years . a harsh hand with losing ventures austere business practices may well keep these carriers on top , despite tough times .
the example of buzz is a case in point , showing what happens to low-cost carriers who lag behind .
the subsidiary of klm was sold to competitor ryanair in january for € 23.2 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.04.2003 unions threaten to oppose german reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is under attack from organized labor for his planned reforms .
german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .
" the reform task is so big that they can only be solved by consensus , " german chamber of industry and commerce association president ludwig georg braun told the newspaper handelsblatt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions criticize schröder 's reform plans several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.04.2003 unions threaten to oppose german reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is under attack from organized labor for his planned reforms .
german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .

german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .

at a time when a war-related decline in business travel has prompted lufthansa to ground 55 of its planes , the continued rise of low-cost airlines bucks the trend .
but how ? low-cost airlines are calm and composed in the face of a war in iraq : although major airlines around the world are fighting for survival -lrb- air canada just declared bankruptcy and american airlines has - thus far - narrowly avoided such a move -rrb- , their discount-minded cousins are selling just as many tickets as before the war . " the war has n't interfered with business at all , " a spokeswoman for high-flying budget carrier ryanair told the german press agency dpa . the reason is simple . low-cost airlines operate primarily in europe 's vacation destinations and they are profiting from an increased trend in city tourism .
they are also benefiting from a thrifty streak among business travelers , the life blood of the majors , who used to pay top dollar for seats .
but those days are now passé .
while the major airlines are experiencing a sharp decline in business traffic , the number of business travelers on hapag-loyd express , the low-cost subsidiary of tui , has risen by 40 percent . clear skies ahead for low-cost carriers top brass at germanwings , air berlin , and europe 's largest low-cost provider , ryanair , are all singing the same song of success while at the same time predicting more to come .
sept .
11th may have sparked the biggest industry crisis in recent memory - one which has cost over a million jobs so far - but , year after year , low-cost airlines are reporting ever-increasing numbers of passengers .
and this trend , according to recent figures , has not been interrupted by the latest wave of hostilities in iraq . " our bookings are now back at the same level they were at before the war broke out , " a spokesman for hapag lloyd express told dpa . germanwings , a subsidiary of eurowings , has sold over a million tickets since launching last october .
the company has seen little difference in ticket sales since the war broke out .
" people have been booking with shorter notice , but the war has n't had any noticeable effects , " a germanwings spokesman told dpa . air berlin is contemplating placing a major order with boeing or airbus for 40 new planes and its passenger load increased 20 percent in 2002 , rising to 6.7 million -lrb- the company predicts the number will increase to 8.3 million by the end of this year -rrb- . ryanair setting the pace ryanair , the super-successful irish outfit that sets the pace for budget competitors across europe , expanded in the german market , adding niederrhein and berlin to its list of german destinations , joining hahn in hunsrück , lübeck and friedrichshafen .
what 's more , ryanair announced in january it would begin operating a fourth european hub in stockholm-stavsta -lrb- with 30 flights throughout europe -rrb- and is in discussions with seven airports to open yet another .
this has led to a 40 percent rise - to a total of 15 million - in the number of passengers flying with ryanair .
and company execs have their eyes on a bigger prize : they predict a passenger load of 40 million by 2013 - more than doubling their current load in 10 years . a harsh hand with losing ventures austere business practices may well keep these carriers on top , despite tough times .
the example of buzz is a case in point , showing what happens to low-cost carriers who lag behind .
the subsidiary of klm was sold to competitor ryanair in january for € 23.2 million .

" the war has n't interfered with business at all , " a spokeswoman for high-flying budget carrier ryanair told the german press agency dpa . the reason is simple . low-cost airlines operate primarily in europe 's vacation destinations and they are profiting from an increased trend in city tourism .
they are also benefiting from a thrifty streak among business travelers , the life blood of the majors , who used to pay top dollar for seats .
but those days are now passé .
while the major airlines are experiencing a sharp decline in business traffic , the number of business travelers on hapag-loyd express , the low-cost subsidiary of tui , has risen by 40 percent . clear skies ahead for low-cost carriers top brass at germanwings , air berlin , and europe 's largest low-cost provider , ryanair , are all singing the same song of success while at the same time predicting more to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.04.2003 unions threaten to oppose german reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is under attack from organized labor for his planned reforms .
german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.04.2003 unions threaten to oppose german reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is under attack from organized labor for his planned reforms .
german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .
" the reform task is so big that they can only be solved by consensus , " german chamber of industry and commerce association president ludwig georg braun told the newspaper handelsblatt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unions criticize schröder 's reform plans several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder .

while the major airlines are experiencing a sharp decline in business traffic , the number of business travelers on hapag-loyd express , the low-cost subsidiary of tui , has risen by 40 percent . clear skies ahead for low-cost carriers top brass at germanwings , air berlin , and europe 's largest low-cost provider , ryanair , are all singing the same song of success while at the same time predicting more to come .
sept .
11th may have sparked the biggest industry crisis in recent memory - one which has cost over a million jobs so far - but , year after year , low-cost airlines are reporting ever-increasing numbers of passengers .
and this trend , according to recent figures , has not been interrupted by the latest wave of hostilities in iraq . " our bookings are now back at the same level they were at before the war broke out , " a spokesman for hapag lloyd express told dpa . germanwings , a subsidiary of eurowings , has sold over a million tickets since launching last october .
the company has seen little difference in ticket sales since the war broke out .
" people have been booking with shorter notice , but the war has n't had any noticeable effects , " a germanwings spokesman told dpa . air berlin is contemplating placing a major order with boeing or airbus for 40 new planes and its passenger load increased 20 percent in 2002 , rising to 6.7 million -lrb- the company predicts the number will increase to 8.3 million by the end of this year -rrb- . ryanair setting the pace ryanair , the super-successful irish outfit that sets the pace for budget competitors across europe , expanded in the german market , adding niederrhein and berlin to its list of german destinations , joining hahn in hunsrück , lübeck and friedrichshafen .
what 's more , ryanair announced in january it would begin operating a fourth european hub in stockholm-stavsta -lrb- with 30 flights throughout europe -rrb- and is in discussions with seven airports to open yet another .
this has led to a 40 percent rise - to a total of 15 million - in the number of passengers flying with ryanair .
and company execs have their eyes on a bigger prize : they predict a passenger load of 40 million by 2013 - more than doubling their current load in 10 years . a harsh hand with losing ventures austere business practices may well keep these carriers on top , despite tough times .
the example of buzz is a case in point , showing what happens to low-cost carriers who lag behind .
the subsidiary of klm was sold to competitor ryanair in january for € 23.2 million .
by the end of february , ryanair announced a massive restructuring and the likely elimination of 400-600 jobs .
fearing for their jobs , buzz pilots swallowed the less than ideal contract offered by their new mother ship , which surely will save ryanair money over the long term . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .

at a time when a war-related decline in business travel has prompted lufthansa to ground 55 of its planes , the continued rise of low-cost airlines bucks the trend .
but how ? low-cost airlines are calm and composed in the face of a war in iraq : although major airlines around the world are fighting for survival -lrb- air canada just declared bankruptcy and american airlines has - thus far - narrowly avoided such a move -rrb- , their discount-minded cousins are selling just as many tickets as before the war . " the war has n't interfered with business at all , " a spokeswoman for high-flying budget carrier ryanair told the german press agency dpa . the reason is simple . low-cost airlines operate primarily in europe 's vacation destinations and they are profiting from an increased trend in city tourism .
they are also benefiting from a thrifty streak among business travelers , the life blood of the majors , who used to pay top dollar for seats .
but those days are now passé .
while the major airlines are experiencing a sharp decline in business traffic , the number of business travelers on hapag-loyd express , the low-cost subsidiary of tui , has risen by 40 percent . clear skies ahead for low-cost carriers top brass at germanwings , air berlin , and europe 's largest low-cost provider , ryanair , are all singing the same song of success while at the same time predicting more to come .

german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .

german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .

german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .

while the major airlines are experiencing a sharp decline in business traffic , the number of business travelers on hapag-loyd express , the low-cost subsidiary of tui , has risen by 40 percent . clear skies ahead for low-cost carriers top brass at germanwings , air berlin , and europe 's largest low-cost provider , ryanair , are all singing the same song of success while at the same time predicting more to come .
sept .
11th may have sparked the biggest industry crisis in recent memory - one which has cost over a million jobs so far - but , year after year , low-cost airlines are reporting ever-increasing numbers of passengers .
and this trend , according to recent figures , has not been interrupted by the latest wave of hostilities in iraq . " our bookings are now back at the same level they were at before the war broke out , " a spokesman for hapag lloyd express told dpa . germanwings , a subsidiary of eurowings , has sold over a million tickets since launching last october .
the company has seen little difference in ticket sales since the war broke out .
" people have been booking with shorter notice , but the war has n't had any noticeable effects , " a germanwings spokesman told dpa . air berlin is contemplating placing a major order with boeing or airbus for 40 new planes and its passenger load increased 20 percent in 2002 , rising to 6.7 million -lrb- the company predicts the number will increase to 8.3 million by the end of this year -rrb- . ryanair setting the pace ryanair , the super-successful irish outfit that sets the pace for budget competitors across europe , expanded in the german market , adding niederrhein and berlin to its list of german destinations , joining hahn in hunsrück , lübeck and friedrichshafen .
what 's more , ryanair announced in january it would begin operating a fourth european hub in stockholm-stavsta -lrb- with 30 flights throughout europe -rrb- and is in discussions with seven airports to open yet another .
this has led to a 40 percent rise - to a total of 15 million - in the number of passengers flying with ryanair .
and company execs have their eyes on a bigger prize : they predict a passenger load of 40 million by 2013 - more than doubling their current load in 10 years . a harsh hand with losing ventures austere business practices may well keep these carriers on top , despite tough times .
the example of buzz is a case in point , showing what happens to low-cost carriers who lag behind .
the subsidiary of klm was sold to competitor ryanair in january for € 23.2 million .
by the end of february , ryanair announced a massive restructuring and the likely elimination of 400-600 jobs .
fearing for their jobs , buzz pilots swallowed the less than ideal contract offered by their new mother ship , which surely will save ryanair money over the long term . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring . a day after schröder and top union representatives failed after a three-hour meeting to reach an agreement on much-needed social system reforms in germany , the country 's organized labor on wednesday warned it would begin rallying opposition to the government 's broad plan .
on tuesday evening , schröder admitted his center-left government of social democrats and greens and its traditional labor allies remained on a collision course .
" as was to be expected , we couldn ’ t resolve our differences today , " he said , adding he would meet the unions again in may .
" i hope i can convince them in future discussions . "
schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german economic growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his " agenda 2010 " plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
warning from unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall boss klaus zwickel on wednesday , the unions went on the offensive .
" we will be able to organize a hot may , " ig metall deputy chairman jürgen peters told inforadio berlin , referring to traditional nationwide labor protests on may 1 .
peters ’ boss at the engineering trade union , klaus zwickel , has dubbed schröder ’ s plans " the most painful social deconstruction in the history of germany since 1945 . "
but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent .
for the moment at least , schröder remains committed to his course .
" there ’ s nothing i can or want to change , " he stated firmly tuesday evening .
whether he will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda is unclear , however , as some spd members of parliament -lrb- mps -rrb- may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy .
the government also faces a potential challenge from its grassroots junior coalition partner , the green party .
greens parliamentary group co-leader krista sager said on wednesday the greens would hold a special party congress on june 14 to debate the labor and social security reforms .
though the greens in parliament are generally considered more willing to back reform than the union-backed spd members of parliament , they are also known for their independent streak on controversial issues .
but the government ca n't afford to lose any votes because of its razor-thin major in the bundestag .
possible vote of confidence that could cause schröder to tie the reforms to a confidence vote , forcing the ruling coalition ’ s members of parliament to either back the reforms or risk toppling the government .
the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april , and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , saying the reforms don ’ t go far enough .
he and others have also begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor .
but business leaders on wednesday urged the conservatives not to block the government ’ s proposals in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , which is controlled by the christian democrats and their free-market liberal allies .

there 's never been a conflict quite like the current war with iraq .
tv news crews and newspaper journalists are covering the conflict in minute detail , as it happens , thanks to a decision to allow hundreds of journalists to be " embedded " with various military units .
but how - with so much information being thrown at us - how can we separate facts from propaganda ?
in the breakfast debate this morning -lrb- wednesday -rrb- we discussed this with bbc 's kate adie and the journalist and author phillip knightley and the bbc 's paul adams in qatar to watch the breakfast debate in full , click here journalists from media organisations all over the world have been assigned to the military including us and british warships , air bases in kuwait and various infantry , artillery and commando units .
they are known as ' embeds ' and their unprecedented access has led to some graphic reports .
but , by placing reporters alongside servicemen and women , is the military controlling what we see ?
there are also the specially groomed spokesmen - many of them generals , who are delivering regular press conferences from central command in doha , qatar .
phillip knightley is the author of the first casualty : the war correspondent as hero and myth maker from crimea to kosovo .
he says the war reporter has an easy choice : become part of the military 's propaganda machine or quit .
of course some journalists have been working independently in iraq but they are at much greater risk - and their movements are often monitored by iraqi authorities .
during the vietnam war , he says , the us military accepted war reporters - they even fed them , defended them and transported them .
he claims that as a result the reporters went wherever they wanted - but ultimately lost the war for the us because of the nature of their reports .
kate adie the bbc 's kate adie covered the kosovo war as the bbc 's chief news correspondent , kate adie spent much of her career reporting from the the front line .
she covered the gulf war in 1991 and conflicts in bosnia , kosovo , armenia , albania , rwanda and sierra leone .
kate is of the opinion that propoganda is n't necessarily the same as lying , but is more about influencing opinions .

fines from 46 cameras are to be used to buy more cameras for areas where there have been deaths or serious injuries .
a further 12 cameras are being introduced immediately in an attempt to reduce the number of road tragedies .
councils in northumberland and tyne and wear have joined forces with northumbria police in the programme to dramatically reduce the number of traffic accidents .
the northumbria safety camera partnership -lrb- nscp -rrb- - which includes the five tyne and wear councils , northumberland county council and northumbria police - will make greater use of speed and red light cameras to persuade speeding motorists to observe the speed limits .
' improve road safety ' the partnership is paid for by a new government scheme , which allows local authorities to use income generated from speeding fines to recover costs and invest in more cameras .
the partnership , which also includes court officials , the highways agency , northumbria healthcare nhs trusts and the university of newcastle , is administered by gateshead council .
john bann , head of transport strategy for gateshead council , said : " all the local authorities involved have a clear goal to improve road safety as well as an obligation to meet the government 's casualty reduction targets .
" all the evidence shows that speed cameras have the desired effect on driver behaviour .
" on average , about 700 deaths or serious injuries occur on the region 's roads every year , so its clear we have an important job to do .
speed camera offences " safety cameras have worked well as part of road safety initiatives elsewhere in the uk and we are confident this new strategy will work here , too .
" by ploughing the income generated by fines back into speed enforcement , we will make life tougher for those who break the law . "
local authorities will monitor accident statistics and use them to identify areas where new cameras can be placed .
the partnership says it expects a fourfold increase in the number of speed camera offences to be processed by the northumbria police ticket office .
in 2002 it handled more than 25,000 camera offences .
the government says local authorities and the police must deliver a 40 % reduction in casualties in road collisions , a 50 % reduction in child casualties , by 2010 .
