berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .

at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .

the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "

in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .

the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.10.2003 berlin , moscow seek to boost bilateral ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- discussed business with president putin in russia on thursday .
berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .

on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .

the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .

though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

berlin ’ s growing rapport with moscow was further cemented wednesday when schröder met with putin in russia for a two-day power summit dominated by trade and energy talks as well as iraq and afghanistan . german chancellor gerhard schröder headed to russia ’ s fourth-largest city of yekaterinenburg nestled in the ural mountains on wednesday for the sixth annual german-russian summit .
accompanied by a high-profile business delegation comprising the heads of energy giants e.on and ruhrgas , chief executives of deutsche bank and lufthansa and labor and economics minister wolfgang clement , it was n't hard to discern the main thrust of the chancellor ’ s agenda .
energy and business top the list of issues to be discussed with russian president vladimir putin and his high-level entourage .
major bilateral projects include the possible construction of a baltic sea natural gas pipeline . russia ’ s gazprom , ruhrgas and germany ’ s wintershall group reportedly want to sign an agreement for a feasibility study of a pipeline to bring russian natural gas to western europe .
both putin and schröder announced on thursday that an agreement would be signed as soon as possible .
other proposals include the inking of a € 500 million deal between e.on and russian power company rao ees rossii to build a power plant in the russian city of schtschukin as well as a mammoth transport agreement that will lead to a speedy and comprehensive revamping of railway lines between the two countries .
official sources say about five to eight corporate deals are expected to be sealed over the two days , amounting to a total business volume of two billion euro .
berlin , moscow share close economic ties on thursday president putin said it was important to develop strong ties with germany and described bilateral relations as having a " strategic character with long-term goals even in economic cooperation . "
chancellor schröder lauded russia 's " breathtaking pace " of economic growth as well as " the reform course under the leadership of putin . "
he added that the conditions for expanding trade and investment had tangibly improved in russia and added political relations could " hardly be better . "
germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry .
ahead of the german-russian summit , chief executive of auto-maker daimlerchrysler , klaus mangold praised president putin ’ s reform course and said the german economy could participate increasingly in russia ’ s improved business environment .
at the same time he cautioned that german industry had to prepare itself for strong competition from american investors in russia , who had evinced increased interest in the country in recent years .
" we were earlier in a situation , where we -lrb- germany -rrb- exclusively dealt with russia , " mangold told news agency dpa .
" but that ’ s no longer the case , " he said .
apt location for high-profile financial deals the location of the bilateral summit lends itself ideally to the weighty wheeling and dealing expected to be played out against the backdrop of the ural mountains .
the 1.5-million strong city of yekaterinenburg , about 1,700 kilometers east of moscow on the border to siberia , is a significant region for both trade and military on account of its strategic location between europe and asia .
with its sorrounding valleys rich in natural resources , the city is reputed to be the cradle of russian industry .
in recent years the region has attracted substantial foreign investment , in particular in the areas of high technology and the food industry .
more than 20 german companies and over 50 german-russian joint ventures are located in yekaterinenburg , said to be one of the fastest-growing areas in russia .
warming political relationship but high finance and investment won ’ t be the only issues on the summit agenda .
on the political front , the two leaders as well as their respective foreign and interior ministers will discuss topics ranging from iraq to the situation in afghanistan and the signing of a transit treaty for the german isaf peacekeeping contingent based in kabul .
the treaty will allow the german army to transport military equipment through russian territory to afghanistan for the first time .
in recent months , berlin and moscow have enjoyed a growing rapport ever since the two joined france in staunchly opposing the u.s.-led iraq war .
both countries have also worked to renew ties with washington , which were badly bruised because of their anti-war stance .
both schröder and putin , who met two weeks ago in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly , are also in agreement on the need for transferring power back to the iraqis as quickly as possible and would like to see such a clause included in any new resolution passed by the u.n. security council .
on tuesday , russia also indicated it would participate in an international donor conference in madrid slated for later this month , to pledge money to reconstruct iraq .
schröder and putin are also said to enjoy a close political friendship helped by the fact that the russian leader speaks fluent german after having served as a kgb agent in former east germany .
hurdles mar thriving ties but despite the burgeoning relationship between moscow and berlin , mild irritants still persist .
though schröder is not expected to openly express concerns about the four-year russian military action in the breakaway republic of chechnya , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to touch upon the issue with his russian counterpart during the summit .
the two leaders will also discuss easing visa regulations in particular for students , artists and sportsmen from both countries , though germany is not expected to endorse total travel freedom for russian citizens to the european union as desired by putin .
the unresolved row over so called " looted art " is expected to be a slight stumbling block during the summit .
neither leader will concretely refer to it , but the return of the baldin art collection to bremen from russia and the recent discovery of a rubens painting , stolen by soviet soldiers during their world war ii occupation in germany and still in the hands of a wealthy russian businessman , are likely to throw a pall over the otherwise positive talks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

welsh squad captain colin charvis managed 3rd place , with 12 % of the votes .
the survey was commissioned by swansea pr agency mgb public relations , the company responsible for marketing the ospreys .

robin mcbryde -lrb- 3 % -rrb- scarlets hooker , 5ft 11in , 15st 8lb researchers interviewed 800 women in swansea , cardiff , and pontypridd for the survey .
they found that , for many women , the excitement of following tactics and game play paled into insignificance against the prospect of watching rippling leg muscles and taught buttocks on the pitch .
the survey revealed : 64 % of women questioned admitted the only reason they watched rugby was to look at players ' legs 65 % thought watching a rugby match would be less enjoyable if the players wore long trousers 60 % were convinced rugby players had sexier legs than soccer players 82 % insisted welsh rugby players had sexier legs that their english counterparts 52 % of women questioned admitted to knowing very little about the game itself , and not even knowing how many points you get for scoring a try , despite regularly tuning in or attending rugby matches .
scott gibbs ' legs were singled out for special admiration the survey has been released as wales gears up for the start of the world cup in australia on sunday , and as rugby clubs fight to boost numbers through the turnstiles .
researchers have suggested that clubs might do worse than sign a sexy player if they want to attract more female spectators .
" it 's no surprise really that , for the majority of women in wales , it 's the players that are the real pull in rugby , " said mgb 's alex sheehan .
" football has , for many years , traded on the celebrity and sex appeal of its players , and football clubs generate millions from a young female fan base who have little interest in the game itself but are prepared to dig deep in support of the football poster boys .
" there 's obviously a real opportunity here for rugby clubs in wales to extend their fan base by offering a more bespoke and targeted rugby experience for women .
" if they are more interested in the players than they are the game then surely clubs should encourage them in their support and develop marketing programmes which are tailored to these distinct needs .
" perhaps shorter shorts and tighter shirts are the way forward . "

he said it was unclear just how big the budget deficit of america 's richest state was , with some sources putting it at $ 38 billion over two years .
the republicans ' newest governor reached out to the democrats who otherwise dominate the state in a call to " rebuild " california together .
the terminator star also warned fans he would have " no time for movies " .
at his first news conference since winning by a wide margin , mr schwarzenegger said he wanted to have an independent audit of the state 's finances to find out where money was possibly being wasted .
there is a lot of work ahead - on my mind is not the movies at all arnold schwarzenegger he said he was " unwilling " to raise taxes and promised to scrap a controversial new car tax .
but he also warned that native american casino operators - who reap annual revenues of $ 5bn - would have to pay their " fair share " .
mr schwarzenegger - who ousted the democratic incumbent gray davis - announced that his transition team would be led by republican congressman david dreier .
the new governor , who will take office next month , pledged to restore trust in california 's government and instil fiscal discipline .
it is the first time in the state 's history that californians have voted to sack their governor mid-term .
president george w bush congratulated mr schwarzenegger by phone , saying he looked forward to working with him .
with all the votes counted , mr schwarzenegger secured 48.7 % - a much greater share of the vote than the polls predicted .
republican activists had triggered the recall vote - the first in 82 years - following frustration at the budget deficit , high levels of unemployment and struggling schools .
the bbc 's justin webb says the people who voted for mr schwarzenegger will soon want to see concrete policies and results from the new governor who has been short on detail and " big " on promises .
trend-setter ?
the bbc 's david willis in los angeles says the big political problem for mr schwarzenegger is that he is not fully in control of the money-raising process .
large parts of the state budget are already earmarked for projects endorsed by referendums and can not be tampered with .
his election has sent a shock wave across america in an age of discontent with conventional politics and could set a trend , our correspondent says .
only one other governor has been recalled in united states history - north dakota 's lynn frazier , in 1921 .
in a two-part ballot , voters were asked if they wanted to recall , or sack , governor davis .
regardless of their decision on the recall , they also had to indicate who they preferred among the 135 alternative candidates running .

he said it was unclear just how big the budget deficit of america 's richest state was , with some sources putting it at $ 38 billion over two years .
the republicans ' newest governor reached out to the democrats who otherwise dominate the state in a call to " rebuild " california together .
the terminator star also warned fans he would have " no time for movies " .
at his first news conference since winning by a wide margin , mr schwarzenegger said he wanted to have an independent audit of the state 's finances to find out where money was possibly being wasted .

but he also warned that native american casino operators - who reap annual revenues of $ 5bn - would have to pay their " fair share " .
mr schwarzenegger - who ousted the democratic incumbent gray davis - announced that his transition team would be led by republican congressman david dreier .
the new governor , who will take office next month , pledged to restore trust in california 's government and instil fiscal discipline .
it is the first time in the state 's history that californians have voted to sack their governor mid-term .

large parts of the state budget are already earmarked for projects endorsed by referendums and can not be tampered with .
his election has sent a shock wave across america in an age of discontent with conventional politics and could set a trend , our correspondent says .
only one other governor has been recalled in united states history - north dakota 's lynn frazier , in 1921 .
in a two-part ballot , voters were asked if they wanted to recall , or sack , governor davis .

a total of 3,467 animals were destroyed in the province this year .
however , statistics show that the number of animals being destroyed each year is decreasing steadily .
the animal welfare charity , the dogs ' trust , said the figures showed there was an average of one stray dog for every 147 people in northern ireland , compared to a british average of one stray for every 529 people .
dogs ' trust 's chief executive clarissa baldwin said : " three thousand , four hundred and sixty seven dogs being killed in a year in a country that purports to be a nation of animal lovers is wholly unacceptable .
" dogs trust will continue fighting for an end to destruction until we reach the day when the figure is zero . "
the charity , which was formerly the national canine defence league , said it believed responsible dog owners held the key to winning the battle to stop dogs being abandoned .
the charity spent £ 2m last year on neutering and microchipping schemes , allowing 27,000 dogs to be neutered and a further 48,000 to be chipped in order that they could be traced if lost .

speaking for the first time since the accident hannah tanhai has told bbc wales she wants better safety procedures and more supervision on transport for children travelling to and from school .
" there 's got to be something in place , " said mrs tanhai .
" if it means that another person who has to travel on the bus - an adult who is wholly responsible for the safety of the kids , then that has to be .
" even if it means it 's the community policeman that travels on that bus and its his priority of the day - that has to happen . "
fellow pupils have laid flowers at the spot where luke died mrs tanhai is still coming to terms with the tragedy and she has been overwhelmed by the flowers and messages of support she has received .

babbacombe cliff railway is one of torquay 's most popular attractions and carries more than 250,000 passengers a year .
but it is nearly 80 years old and parts of it need replacing .
independent experts have examined the railway and say £ 500,000 needs to be spent in the next five years to secure its long-term future .
torbay councillors will decide at a meeting next week what action to take .
oddicombe beach is a popular visitor attraction their options include closing the railway , repairing it at a huge cost or leasing it to a private firm .
the electric-powered railway provides an essential link to reach oddicombe beach .
but for the last two years it has had to be closed for part of the summer due to mechanical failure .
the future of the beach is also uncertain as the cliffs above it are crumbling away .
neighbouring redgate beach was closed a few years ago because falling rocks made it dangerous .
now the council is assessing whether it will shore up the oddicombe cliffs , but that will mean another huge bill .
the cliffs above oddicombe beach are crumbling away council leader chris harris said they did not want to see the railway disappear .
" access to oddicombe beach is currently being reviewed by the council , " he said .
" it 's a fantastic beach and is used by families and elderly people alike , so the access to that is key .
" we have to bear in mind that , during the past summer when we have had problems with the railway , the council put on minibuses to help people maintain that access . "

babbacombe cliff railway is one of torquay 's most popular attractions and carries more than 250,000 passengers a year .
but it is nearly 80 years old and parts of it need replacing .
independent experts have examined the railway and say £ 500,000 needs to be spent in the next five years to secure its long-term future .
torbay councillors will decide at a meeting next week what action to take .
oddicombe beach is a popular visitor attraction their options include closing the railway , repairing it at a huge cost or leasing it to a private firm .
the electric-powered railway provides an essential link to reach oddicombe beach .
but for the last two years it has had to be closed for part of the summer due to mechanical failure .
the future of the beach is also uncertain as the cliffs above it are crumbling away .
neighbouring redgate beach was closed a few years ago because falling rocks made it dangerous .
now the council is assessing whether it will shore up the oddicombe cliffs , but that will mean another huge bill .
the cliffs above oddicombe beach are crumbling away council leader chris harris said they did not want to see the railway disappear .
" access to oddicombe beach is currently being reviewed by the council , " he said .
" it 's a fantastic beach and is used by families and elderly people alike , so the access to that is key .
" we have to bear in mind that , during the past summer when we have had problems with the railway , the council put on minibuses to help people maintain that access . "
the railway started operating in 1926 , but was closed during world war ii for security reasons .
it was refurbished and re-opened in 1951 , and in 1993 , £ 60,000 was spent replacing the track .

mr varley will move up to the position of deputy chief executive in january , before becoming group chief executive in december 2004 .
the current chief executive , matthew barrett , is to become chairman , replacing sir peter middleton who is retiring .
mr varley had been one of the favourites to take over from mr barrett and the bank said the changes marked a " smooth transition of leadership " .
' unique ' chairman the movement of matthew barrett from chief executive to chairman appears to go against the recommendations of the higgs review into best boardroom practice .
however , barclays defended the decision , saying he was " uniquely " qualified for the role , and adding that they had consulted closely with shareholders before the move .
" -lrb- mr barrett -rrb- is one of the world 's most senior international bankers of many years standing , " a barclays spokeswoman said .
she added that higgs had noted there was a difference between cases where people became chairman after spending many years at a firm , and those - such as barclays - where the person was a relatively new recruit .
mr barrett joined barclays four years ago from bank of montreal .
continuity analysts said there was unlikely to be a big change in the way the bank was run .
" -lrb- varley 's -rrb- just going to carry on where matt barrett left off , " said noel reynolds , banking analyst at commerzbank .
naguib kheraj , currently chief executive of barclays private clients , will replace mr varley as finance director .
barclays also announced that investment banking head bob diamond - who was also thought to be in the running for the top job - has been asked expand the group 's investment banking and asset management businesses worldwide .

according to the 2000 census , 47 million people over the age of five - nearly a sixth of the us population - do not speak english with their families .
this is an increase of 15 million people since 1990 .
the changes reflect the surge in immigration into the us since 1990 , an influx which has made hispanics the largest minority group .
california led the states where people spoke a language other than english at home , followed by new mexico and texas .
the west and south of the us had about three times the number of spanish speakers -lrb- 21 million -rrb- as the north-east and midwest -lrb- 7 million -rrb- .
linguistic isolation there has also been a sharp rise in the number of americans regarded as " linguistically isolated " because of their limited english .
us languages -lrb- excluding english -rrb- spanish : 28,101,052 chinese : 2,022,143 french : 1,643,838 german : 1,382,613 tagalog -lrb- philippines -rrb- : 1,224,241 vietnamese : 1,009,627 italian : 1,008,370 korean : 894,063 russian : 706,242 polish : 667,414 arabic : 614,582 portuguese : 564,630 japanese : 477,997 french creole : 453,368 greek : 365,436 hindi : 317,057 persian : 312,085 urdu : 262,900 gujarathi : 235,988 armenian : 202,708 nearly 12 million people live in households where no adult speaks english well enough to communicate easily in shops , or with doctors or police .
but the report , entitled language use and english-speaking ability : 2000 , said 55 % of the people who spoke a language other than english at home said they spoke english " very well " .

for £ 15.99 a month , the service provider will offer a 150kbps connection , three times faster than a dial-up link .
" the new offer gets rid of the price gap between narrowband and broadband , " said steve horley , tiscali 's net service director .
but analysts and net providers are sceptical that the low speed will offer the broadband experience people expect .
' bonsai ' broadband most people can get a standard broadband connection of 512kbps for about £ 30 a month , although there are higher speed products available at a price .
tiscali 's recently appointed chief executive mary turner told bbc news online that their new product was for people who want a faster connection that what they get with their dial-up 56kbps modem .
they are offering a carefully cultured bonsai broadband product which is really aimed at creating a product to get people away from dial-up ian fogg , jupiter research " there is a whole section of the population who want the broadband experience but do not require the 512kbps speed or do not want to pay £ 30 for it . "
she added that many cable net access providers offer the broadband speeds of 150kbps , so tiscali were opening up the choice for adsl -lrb- asymmetric digital subscriber line -rrb- customers .
tiscali hope the cut-price package will attract about 20 % of the uk net access market , which bt openworld , freeserve and aol currently dominate .
with 80 % of the uk able to access broadband services , tiscali say their move will inject more competition into the high-speed net access market .
but bt were sceptical of the announcement .
" tiscali are really just dressing up a basic product launch with spin , " a spokesperson told bbc news online .
" all they are doing is announcing yet another product , which other companies are already offering . "
people expect to do a lot with broadband he added that competition between high-speed net service providers was already healthy .
in a report last month , the government 's e-commerce minister stephen timms said the uk is more competitive than its european g7 neighbours and the usa .
broadband analysts from jupiter research were wary too , suggesting that 150kbps was not really true " high-speed " net .
" they are offering a carefully cultured bonsai broadband product which is really aimed at creating a product to get people away from dial-up , " said jupiter 's ian fogg .
" the cut-back speed does not really offer the full broadband experience that customers expect , " he said .
" it wo n't deliver rich content like video , audio , fast downloads , and online gaming . "
cutting it across the european broadband market , service providers are finding a number of different ways to compete and offer lower prices .
broadband uptake in the uk is at a critical point .
early adopters have bought it up to now , and it 's on the verge of reaching mainstream adoption patrick bossert , kpmg analyst while some are reducing the speed of a broadband connection , others are making higher speeds only available at evenings and weekends .
some are even experimenting with metered broadband access .
" we 'll probably see over the next months a number of other providers offering cut back , barely there broadband products , " said mr fogg .
" but they may all do it differently . "
some analysts say tiscali 's decision could help to encourage more people to move to broadband .
" it 's very positive news for the uk broadband industry in a couple of ways , " said patrick bossert , principal strategist at atos kpmg consulting .
" broadband uptake in the uk is at a critical point .

for £ 15.99 a month , the service provider will offer a 150kbps connection , three times faster than a dial-up link .
" the new offer gets rid of the price gap between narrowband and broadband , " said steve horley , tiscali 's net service director .
