german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .
expert say his visit could provide a boost to the depressed region . accompanied by economics and labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , right -rrb- and head of siemens and chairman of the asia pacific council heinrich von pierer , chancellor schröder is to visit malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam in the coming days .
business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .
but finding the money for it is a big problem .
" that ’ s why it ’ s good , when one travels there and says ‘ don ’ t lose hope , we ’ ll support you ’ , " machetzki said .
germany has strong economic interests it remains unclear what chancellor schröder is likely to offer the region in economic terms , but there ’ s little doubt that berlin has a strong economic interest there .
singapore is germany ’ s most important partner in the region with a foreign trade volume of € 7,7 billion and direct german investments amounting to € 4,3 billion .
about 600 german companies are based there .
german industry is mainly interested in ship-building projects in indonesia which its 500 islands , while in malaysia schröder ’ s delegation is expected to hold talks on german participation in constructing a more than 600-kilometer-long rail track .
the opening of a high-tech siemens center in malaysia and german interest in helping indonesia expand its regional waterworks is also expected to figure in the talks .
signal to islamic countries though trade talks will be the focus of schröder ’ s visit , the fight against terrorism and the consequences of the iraq war are also likely to figure on the agenda .
experts say that concrete decisions or agreements other than the intensifying of cooperation in the war against terror aren ’ t expected because the united states plays the key role in these matters .
" but despite that , the visit could at least be a signal to islamic countries such as indonesia that one can understand their difficulties with the u.s. on account of their rejection of the war on iraq , " bernhard dahm of the university of passau said . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but now an exhibition showcasing some of the most extraordinary archeological finds in germany over the past 25 years enables visitors to see first-hand the fruits of this obscure field of research . take for example the messel fossil pit in the state of hesse .
the site was set to become a waste disposal site in the 1980s .
then its wealth of plant and animal fossils came to light , giving scientists access to traces of life 49 million years ago , in a lush primeval forest with a nearly tropical climate .
the site , deemed germany ’ s only unesco world natural heritage site in 1995 , has not yet been fully explored and continues to reveal more about prehistoric times . until august 24 , 2003 , around 4,000 of the most spectacular finds of the past quarter century will be accessible to the public in the exhibition “ peoples through time and space - archeology in germany " at the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . the exhibition , which took five years to compile , is grouped into 26 sections , moving chronologically from prehistoric times to modern history .
it pursues the question of whether the neanderthal - first discovered in the neander valley near düsseldorf in 1856 - was actually a predecessor of homo sapiens .

german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .
expert say his visit could provide a boost to the depressed region . accompanied by economics and labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , right -rrb- and head of siemens and chairman of the asia pacific council heinrich von pierer , chancellor schröder is to visit malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam in the coming days .
business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .
but finding the money for it is a big problem .
" that ’ s why it ’ s good , when one travels there and says ‘ don ’ t lose hope , we ’ ll support you ’ , " machetzki said .
germany has strong economic interests it remains unclear what chancellor schröder is likely to offer the region in economic terms , but there ’ s little doubt that berlin has a strong economic interest there .
singapore is germany ’ s most important partner in the region with a foreign trade volume of € 7,7 billion and direct german investments amounting to € 4,3 billion .
about 600 german companies are based there .
german industry is mainly interested in ship-building projects in indonesia which its 500 islands , while in malaysia schröder ’ s delegation is expected to hold talks on german participation in constructing a more than 600-kilometer-long rail track .
the opening of a high-tech siemens center in malaysia and german interest in helping indonesia expand its regional waterworks is also expected to figure in the talks .
signal to islamic countries though trade talks will be the focus of schröder ’ s visit , the fight against terrorism and the consequences of the iraq war are also likely to figure on the agenda .
experts say that concrete decisions or agreements other than the intensifying of cooperation in the war against terror aren ’ t expected because the united states plays the key role in these matters .

german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .
expert say his visit could provide a boost to the depressed region . accompanied by economics and labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , right -rrb- and head of siemens and chairman of the asia pacific council heinrich von pierer , chancellor schröder is to visit malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam in the coming days .
business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .

german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .
expert say his visit could provide a boost to the depressed region . accompanied by economics and labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , right -rrb- and head of siemens and chairman of the asia pacific council heinrich von pierer , chancellor schröder is to visit malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam in the coming days .
business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .
but finding the money for it is a big problem .
" that ’ s why it ’ s good , when one travels there and says ‘ don ’ t lose hope , we ’ ll support you ’ , " machetzki said .
germany has strong economic interests it remains unclear what chancellor schröder is likely to offer the region in economic terms , but there ’ s little doubt that berlin has a strong economic interest there .
singapore is germany ’ s most important partner in the region with a foreign trade volume of € 7,7 billion and direct german investments amounting to € 4,3 billion .
about 600 german companies are based there .
german industry is mainly interested in ship-building projects in indonesia which its 500 islands , while in malaysia schröder ’ s delegation is expected to hold talks on german participation in constructing a more than 600-kilometer-long rail track .
the opening of a high-tech siemens center in malaysia and german interest in helping indonesia expand its regional waterworks is also expected to figure in the talks .
signal to islamic countries though trade talks will be the focus of schröder ’ s visit , the fight against terrorism and the consequences of the iraq war are also likely to figure on the agenda .

but now an exhibition showcasing some of the most extraordinary archeological finds in germany over the past 25 years enables visitors to see first-hand the fruits of this obscure field of research . take for example the messel fossil pit in the state of hesse .

an exhibition of the most spectacular finds from a quarter of a century of archeological excavation in germany is on show in bonn . archeology conjures up images of lost cultures and dusty treasures in faraway lands in most people ’ s minds .
but now an exhibition showcasing some of the most extraordinary archeological finds in germany over the past 25 years enables visitors to see first-hand the fruits of this obscure field of research . take for example the messel fossil pit in the state of hesse .
the site was set to become a waste disposal site in the 1980s .
then its wealth of plant and animal fossils came to light , giving scientists access to traces of life 49 million years ago , in a lush primeval forest with a nearly tropical climate .
the site , deemed germany ’ s only unesco world natural heritage site in 1995 , has not yet been fully explored and continues to reveal more about prehistoric times . until august 24 , 2003 , around 4,000 of the most spectacular finds of the past quarter century will be accessible to the public in the exhibition “ peoples through time and space - archeology in germany " at the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . the exhibition , which took five years to compile , is grouped into 26 sections , moving chronologically from prehistoric times to modern history .
it pursues the question of whether the neanderthal - first discovered in the neander valley near düsseldorf in 1856 - was actually a predecessor of homo sapiens .
visitors can also see the oldest spears in the world as well as a flute made from a swan ’ s bone , presumably the oldest musical instrument on earth . celts , romans and germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a celtic cross from a burial site .

german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .
expert say his visit could provide a boost to the depressed region . accompanied by economics and labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , right -rrb- and head of siemens and chairman of the asia pacific council heinrich von pierer , chancellor schröder is to visit malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam in the coming days .
business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .
but finding the money for it is a big problem .
" that ’ s why it ’ s good , when one travels there and says ‘ don ’ t lose hope , we ’ ll support you ’ , " machetzki said .
germany has strong economic interests it remains unclear what chancellor schröder is likely to offer the region in economic terms , but there ’ s little doubt that berlin has a strong economic interest there .
singapore is germany ’ s most important partner in the region with a foreign trade volume of € 7,7 billion and direct german investments amounting to € 4,3 billion .
about 600 german companies are based there .
german industry is mainly interested in ship-building projects in indonesia which its 500 islands , while in malaysia schröder ’ s delegation is expected to hold talks on german participation in constructing a more than 600-kilometer-long rail track .
the opening of a high-tech siemens center in malaysia and german interest in helping indonesia expand its regional waterworks is also expected to figure in the talks .
signal to islamic countries though trade talks will be the focus of schröder ’ s visit , the fight against terrorism and the consequences of the iraq war are also likely to figure on the agenda .
experts say that concrete decisions or agreements other than the intensifying of cooperation in the war against terror aren ’ t expected because the united states plays the key role in these matters .
" but despite that , the visit could at least be a signal to islamic countries such as indonesia that one can understand their difficulties with the u.s. on account of their rejection of the war on iraq , " bernhard dahm of the university of passau said . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .

experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .

business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .
but finding the money for it is a big problem .
" that ’ s why it ’ s good , when one travels there and says ‘ don ’ t lose hope , we ’ ll support you ’ , " machetzki said .
germany has strong economic interests it remains unclear what chancellor schröder is likely to offer the region in economic terms , but there ’ s little doubt that berlin has a strong economic interest there .
singapore is germany ’ s most important partner in the region with a foreign trade volume of € 7,7 billion and direct german investments amounting to € 4,3 billion .
about 600 german companies are based there .
german industry is mainly interested in ship-building projects in indonesia which its 500 islands , while in malaysia schröder ’ s delegation is expected to hold talks on german participation in constructing a more than 600-kilometer-long rail track .
the opening of a high-tech siemens center in malaysia and german interest in helping indonesia expand its regional waterworks is also expected to figure in the talks .
signal to islamic countries though trade talks will be the focus of schröder ’ s visit , the fight against terrorism and the consequences of the iraq war are also likely to figure on the agenda .
experts say that concrete decisions or agreements other than the intensifying of cooperation in the war against terror aren ’ t expected because the united states plays the key role in these matters .
" but despite that , the visit could at least be a signal to islamic countries such as indonesia that one can understand their difficulties with the u.s. on account of their rejection of the war on iraq , " bernhard dahm of the university of passau said . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .
expert say his visit could provide a boost to the depressed region . accompanied by economics and labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , right -rrb- and head of siemens and chairman of the asia pacific council heinrich von pierer , chancellor schröder is to visit malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam in the coming days .
business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .
but finding the money for it is a big problem .
" that ’ s why it ’ s good , when one travels there and says ‘ don ’ t lose hope , we ’ ll support you ’ , " machetzki said .
germany has strong economic interests it remains unclear what chancellor schröder is likely to offer the region in economic terms , but there ’ s little doubt that berlin has a strong economic interest there .
singapore is germany ’ s most important partner in the region with a foreign trade volume of € 7,7 billion and direct german investments amounting to € 4,3 billion .
about 600 german companies are based there .
german industry is mainly interested in ship-building projects in indonesia which its 500 islands , while in malaysia schröder ’ s delegation is expected to hold talks on german participation in constructing a more than 600-kilometer-long rail track .
the opening of a high-tech siemens center in malaysia and german interest in helping indonesia expand its regional waterworks is also expected to figure in the talks .
signal to islamic countries though trade talks will be the focus of schröder ’ s visit , the fight against terrorism and the consequences of the iraq war are also likely to figure on the agenda .
experts say that concrete decisions or agreements other than the intensifying of cooperation in the war against terror aren ’ t expected because the united states plays the key role in these matters .
" but despite that , the visit could at least be a signal to islamic countries such as indonesia that one can understand their difficulties with the u.s. on account of their rejection of the war on iraq , " bernhard dahm of the university of passau said . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .
expert say his visit could provide a boost to the depressed region . accompanied by economics and labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , right -rrb- and head of siemens and chairman of the asia pacific council heinrich von pierer , chancellor schröder is to visit malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam in the coming days .
business talks and the intensifying of trade relations are to top the agenda .
germany has strong trade ties to the countries belonging to the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and schröder ’ s visit to the region is being awarded high priority by berlin .
schröder 's visit seen as a massage for the soul but even more importantly , the chancellor ’ s delegation is likely to receive an eager welcome by the region ’ s leaders , who have been struggling with poor growth and sputtering economies in the face of the global economic slowdown .
rüdiger machetzki , expert at the institute for asian studies in hamburg , told dw-world that the chancellor ’ s visit is symbolic and necessary to lift the depressed spirits in the region .
" the visit is very important for the region as a kind of massage for the soul , " he said .
though malaysia , singapore , indonesia and vietnam are considered as models in the floundering region with growth rates of at least three percent each , the four destinations aren ’ t immune to the problems plaguing the region since the asian economic crisis in 1997 .
southeast asia stuck in a rut experts say the reason for the economic malaise in the region despite growth rates that sound like a dream to europe is easy to explain . machetzki said that unlike in the west , the southeast asian region needed an enduring economic growth rate of at least five to six percent to make any kind of tangible progress .
he said an atmosphere of gloom would descend if the countries slipped from an economic growth rate of five percent because of the huge numbers affected .
according to machetzki , indonesia alone has to find jobs for 2,5 million workers yearly due to rapid population growth .
experts also say the competitive edge enjoyed by the southeast asian region until just a few years ago is history now .
instead the countries have to contend with china and even mexico beating them to their share of the world market .
machetzki says the companies in the region desperately need to replace their largely redundant and old machinery to keep up with the tough competition .
but finding the money for it is a big problem .
" that ’ s why it ’ s good , when one travels there and says ‘ don ’ t lose hope , we ’ ll support you ’ , " machetzki said .
germany has strong economic interests it remains unclear what chancellor schröder is likely to offer the region in economic terms , but there ’ s little doubt that berlin has a strong economic interest there .
singapore is germany ’ s most important partner in the region with a foreign trade volume of € 7,7 billion and direct german investments amounting to € 4,3 billion .
about 600 german companies are based there .
german industry is mainly interested in ship-building projects in indonesia which its 500 islands , while in malaysia schröder ’ s delegation is expected to hold talks on german participation in constructing a more than 600-kilometer-long rail track .

an exhibition of the most spectacular finds from a quarter of a century of archeological excavation in germany is on show in bonn . archeology conjures up images of lost cultures and dusty treasures in faraway lands in most people ’ s minds .
but now an exhibition showcasing some of the most extraordinary archeological finds in germany over the past 25 years enables visitors to see first-hand the fruits of this obscure field of research . take for example the messel fossil pit in the state of hesse .
the site was set to become a waste disposal site in the 1980s .
then its wealth of plant and animal fossils came to light , giving scientists access to traces of life 49 million years ago , in a lush primeval forest with a nearly tropical climate .
the site , deemed germany ’ s only unesco world natural heritage site in 1995 , has not yet been fully explored and continues to reveal more about prehistoric times . until august 24 , 2003 , around 4,000 of the most spectacular finds of the past quarter century will be accessible to the public in the exhibition “ peoples through time and space - archeology in germany " at the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . the exhibition , which took five years to compile , is grouped into 26 sections , moving chronologically from prehistoric times to modern history .
it pursues the question of whether the neanderthal - first discovered in the neander valley near düsseldorf in 1856 - was actually a predecessor of homo sapiens .

while people are aware of the health risks of too much sun they do little to protect themselves against the harmful ultra violet rays , according to the survey commissioned by cancer research uk .
the research found people in scotland had the most knowledge about the dangers of the sun - but took the least action to protect themselves .
more than 6,500 cases of skin cancer were diagnosed each year in scotland , but fewer than 22 % of those questioned seek shade and fewer than 41 % apply high factor sunscreen .
but who is most at risk of developing skin cancer and what can they do to minimise the risks ?
sun safety stay out of sun 1100-1500 bst cover up wear sunglasses with uv protection never burn use factor 15 + sunscreen take extra care of children do not use sunbeds fair-skinned people with pale eyes are most likely to develop the disease , with the statistics weighed most heavily against them if they have freckles or burn easily .
sara hiom , the charity 's science information manager , said the risk was lower for black and asian people but there was still no room for complacency .
a total of 6,000 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the uk each year , which can prove fatal if untreated .
but a further 59,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer - a more easily treated form of the disease - are also diagnosed each year .
hereditary factors play a part in determining risk , including if another family member has already had skin cancer .
childhood sunburn but 80 % of all skin cancers are caused by exposure to ultraviolet rays , said ms hiom .
" sunburn can double your risk of skin cancer , " she said .
studies have suggested getting sunburnt as a child can also increases risks , with some suggesting that getting sunburnt twice in youth could double the risk of developing skin cancer in later life . "
it is only where you constantly feed the message that it starts to sink in " sara hiom cancer research uk skin cancers can take up to 20-30 years to develop .
people need to be extra vigilant if they have moles and look for changes in their shape , colour , be aware of any itchiness or bleeding and watch for new moles appearing .

the decision has dismayed a small group of kidney patients who have to travel more than 40 miles over difficult country roads to derriford hospital in plymouth up to three days a week for treatment .
disappointment marie white is one of the disappointed kidney patients who had pinned their hopes on the new centre at holsworthy hospital .
the health trust moved the goal posts at the last moment richard brown , mayor of holsworthy mrs white currently has to travel from her home in bude to plymouth and back for her life-saving treatment , which means a nine-hour day .
she makes the journey on mondays , wednesdays and fridays and spends most of the other days of the week recovering .
her husband reg said the unit in holsworthy would have transformed their lives .
" we were all bitterly disappointed and slightly outraged by the cavalier and crass way it was handled by the health trust that moved the goalposts at the last moment , " said richard brown , the town 's mayor .
misplaced commitment holsworthy hospital 's league of friends started the fund-raising believing they had a commitment from the then local health authority to go ahead with the project if they could raise the money .
but a change in the management structure of health service delivery led to the creation of the north devon primary care trust .
its director of public health , dr mike owen , wrote to the campaigners to tell them that it was no longer able to support the project .
dr owen wrote : " regrettably this has fallen to the wayside against some very tight financial circumstances where if you are putting £ 40,000 into a service where people are already getting treatment , then you may be forgoing services where people are n't getting treatment . "
the local liberal democrat mp , john burnett , accepted that the new health authority had inherited a huge budget deficit from its predecessor .
but he described the decision as a slap in the face for the community of holsworthy .
however he said the primary care trust had undertaken to review the decision in two years .

sandy mitchell , from kirkintilloch , glasgow , and william sampson , a british citizen born in glasgow , face public beheading after being convicted of planting a bomb under christopher rodway 's car in november 2000 .
james cottle , from manchester , peter brandon , from wales , les walker from the wirral and james lee - are serving 12 year sentences for plotting the bombings , which also injured other foreigners , in an alleged feud over illicit alcohol trading among expatriates .
mr rodway 's widow , jane , said : " i really do not know if these men are innocent or guilty - but i have to blame somebody . "
to be in an arab prison is worse than being in hell mr rodway 's family member campaigners for some of the six have argued their convictions were based on televised confessions , extracted under duress , and despite evidence islamic extremists opposed to riyadh 's close relationship with america and britain could be responsible for the bombings .
mrs rodway admits her husband , who worked as a controls engineer in the it section of the riyadh armed forces hospital , had not known the six or been involved in the illegal alcohol trade .
last week another member of mr rodway 's family , speaking anonymously , said all six should be immediately freed .

the national autistic society -lrb- nas -rrb- has published a report which suggests that many people are missing out on benefits .
little over half those surveyed said there were appropriate facilities in their area .
and there were calls for those working with sufferers to receive specific training .
robert mckay , nas 's national co-ordinator for scotland , said : " people with autism spectrum disorders continue to find themselves doubly excluded , first as a result of their social and communications impairments and then because support services are not designed or equipped to effectively meet their needs .
" the scottish executive has started to address this exclusion , particularly for children , but more needs to be done . "
families affected by autism in scotland need more and better support to help them access their full range of rights and entitlements " robert mckay nas national co-ordinator " an urgent priority is autism awareness training and job-specific training in autism for all professionals working with this group .
" families affected by autism in scotland need more and better support to help them access their full range of rights and entitlements . "
the mas report was published on sunday to mark autism awareness week , which starts on monday .
according to the report , more than a third of carers said they did not understand the benefits system and 53 % had problems filling out claim forms .
almost two thirds said they faced difficulties securing support from social services , while 35 % were dissatisfied with the support they receive .
many people said they were unable to find a social worker who they felt understood their needs .
some 54 % of those surveyed said they had appropriate play and leisure facilities in their area , while only 9 % said they had been given social skills training .

music downloaders are trying to hide what they are doing in recent weeks , the us music industry has stepped up attempts to stop piracy on peer-to-peer networks such as kazaa and grokster .
the industry 's trade body has started suing individual file swappers , has sent warning messages to millions of peer-to-peer users and is thought to be developing programs that hijack the computers of suspected pirates .
but users are fighting back by creating tools that help people avoid the attention of anti-pirate groups and block attempts to limit what they can do online .
address unknown in late april , the riaa used the messaging systems built in to the kazaa and grokster peer-to-peer file swapping systems to remind people that it is illegal to distribute copyrighted pop without permission .
companies working on behalf of the music industry are known to watch peer-to-peer networks to find people pirating pop music and to plant fake files that look authentic but when played are recordings of white noise .
but net savvy file swappers are fighting back and creating tools that help people avoid the attentions of the piracy police as well as spot the bogus files .
peer-to-peer news sites , such as zeropaid , regularly provide lists of net addresses known to be used by the music industry and its proxies .
pc users could find their machines are hijacked net users with a personal firewall can tell the software to block these addresses so their files can not be downloaded by people using them .
this makes it much harder for the music industry to find out if a particular track being offered is pirated .
one of the most popular lists , called zerodata bad ip block list , is prepared in a format for a popular firewall .
also available is a program called peerguardian that was originally written to block the spyware inside some peer-to-peer programs but has been updated to block particular net addresses too .
blocking the addresses stops users downloading files from the locations and should help them avoid fake files .
currently , some of the net address-blocking tools are not perfect as the range of addresses they knock out can be very wide and stop some people using popular sites .
other users are turning to the kazaa lite program which is a version of kazaa with the spyware and adware stripped out .
this program has tools built in that let people restrict who can see their list of files that want to share .
online net technology magazine security focus was among the first to break the news about the peer-to-peer fightback .
