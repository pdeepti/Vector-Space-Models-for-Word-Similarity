but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .
though monday 's report largely absolves blair , the prime minister must still face off against parliamentary inquisitors when he appears before the house of commons on tuesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : tony under pressure the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down came as a massive blow . failed power play ? " there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .

but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .
" sardinia , just nine kilometers away , has enjoyed autonomy since 1948 and has no independence seekers , " he said . colonna 's capture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna commentators have put forward various theories for vote 's failure , which came hot on the heels of friday 's capture of corsica 's most wanted separatist , yvan colonna -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is suspected of murdering the island ’ s paris-installed governor claude erignac in 1998 . “ if paris wanted to support the “ no ” camp , they couldn ’ t have come up with a better method , ” corsican nationalist jean guy talamoni told the german news agency dpa , referring to colonna ’ s arrest . other observers mooted many corsicans did support the plans for greater autonomy , but were fearful of being allied with radical rival nationalist groups .
and some believe corsicans were simply put off the plans for change , fearing civil service job losses once the proposals were implemented . corsica - napoleon 's birthplace and a tourist attraction - has suffered years of bomb attacks and violence by rival separatist movements .
the latest cycle of violence began in the mid-1970s when the murder of two policemen began a guerilla campaign to gain independence from france .
most of the 270,000 who live on corsica do not support the campaign , but fear openly saying so . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .

and some believe corsicans were simply put off the plans for change , fearing civil service job losses once the proposals were implemented . corsica - napoleon 's birthplace and a tourist attraction - has suffered years of bomb attacks and violence by rival separatist movements .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.07.2003 move over , al jazeera : french muslims launch own tv station großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beur tv aims to serve people of arab descent in france , like soccer superstar zinedine zidane .
there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down came as a massive blow . failed power play ? " there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east runs as high as 18 percent in some areas .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .
though monday 's report largely absolves blair , the prime minister must still face off against parliamentary inquisitors when he appears before the house of commons on tuesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : tony under pressure the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .

" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.07.2003 move over , al jazeera : french muslims launch own tv station großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beur tv aims to serve people of arab descent in france , like soccer superstar zinedine zidane .
there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.07.2003 british government exonerated of " sexing up " report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : report : blair not guilty a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .
but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .
though monday 's report largely absolves blair , the prime minister must still face off against parliamentary inquisitors when he appears before the house of commons on tuesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : tony under pressure the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .

" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .

the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.07.2003 move over , al jazeera : french muslims launch own tv station großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beur tv aims to serve people of arab descent in france , like soccer superstar zinedine zidane .
there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .
" sardinia , just nine kilometers away , has enjoyed autonomy since 1948 and has no independence seekers , " he said . colonna 's capture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna commentators have put forward various theories for vote 's failure , which came hot on the heels of friday 's capture of corsica 's most wanted separatist , yvan colonna -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is suspected of murdering the island ’ s paris-installed governor claude erignac in 1998 . “ if paris wanted to support the “ no ” camp , they couldn ’ t have come up with a better method , ” corsican nationalist jean guy talamoni told the german news agency dpa , referring to colonna ’ s arrest . other observers mooted many corsicans did support the plans for greater autonomy , but were fearful of being allied with radical rival nationalist groups .
and some believe corsicans were simply put off the plans for change , fearing civil service job losses once the proposals were implemented . corsica - napoleon 's birthplace and a tourist attraction - has suffered years of bomb attacks and violence by rival separatist movements .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down came as a massive blow . failed power play ? " there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east runs as high as 18 percent in some areas .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns . " a suitable topic for a show that is really all about marriage – the marriage of french and muslim culture . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corsica says " non " to greater autonomy the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down came as a massive blow . failed power play ? " there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east runs as high as 18 percent in some areas .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .
" sardinia , just nine kilometers away , has enjoyed autonomy since 1948 and has no independence seekers , " he said . colonna 's capture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna commentators have put forward various theories for vote 's failure , which came hot on the heels of friday 's capture of corsica 's most wanted separatist , yvan colonna -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is suspected of murdering the island ’ s paris-installed governor claude erignac in 1998 . “ if paris wanted to support the “ no ” camp , they couldn ’ t have come up with a better method , ” corsican nationalist jean guy talamoni told the german news agency dpa , referring to colonna ’ s arrest . other observers mooted many corsicans did support the plans for greater autonomy , but were fearful of being allied with radical rival nationalist groups .
and some believe corsicans were simply put off the plans for change , fearing civil service job losses once the proposals were implemented . corsica - napoleon 's birthplace and a tourist attraction - has suffered years of bomb attacks and violence by rival separatist movements .
the latest cycle of violence began in the mid-1970s when the murder of two policemen began a guerilla campaign to gain independence from france .
most of the 270,000 who live on corsica do not support the campaign , but fear openly saying so . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .
though monday 's report largely absolves blair , the prime minister must still face off against parliamentary inquisitors when he appears before the house of commons on tuesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : tony under pressure the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .

the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.07.2003 move over , al jazeera : french muslims launch own tv station großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beur tv aims to serve people of arab descent in france , like soccer superstar zinedine zidane .
there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down came as a massive blow . failed power play ? " there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east runs as high as 18 percent in some areas .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .
" sardinia , just nine kilometers away , has enjoyed autonomy since 1948 and has no independence seekers , " he said . colonna 's capture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna commentators have put forward various theories for vote 's failure , which came hot on the heels of friday 's capture of corsica 's most wanted separatist , yvan colonna -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is suspected of murdering the island ’ s paris-installed governor claude erignac in 1998 . “ if paris wanted to support the “ no ” camp , they couldn ’ t have come up with a better method , ” corsican nationalist jean guy talamoni told the german news agency dpa , referring to colonna ’ s arrest . other observers mooted many corsicans did support the plans for greater autonomy , but were fearful of being allied with radical rival nationalist groups .
and some believe corsicans were simply put off the plans for change , fearing civil service job losses once the proposals were implemented . corsica - napoleon 's birthplace and a tourist attraction - has suffered years of bomb attacks and violence by rival separatist movements .
the latest cycle of violence began in the mid-1970s when the murder of two policemen began a guerilla campaign to gain independence from france .
most of the 270,000 who live on corsica do not support the campaign , but fear openly saying so . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.07.2003 british government exonerated of " sexing up " report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : report : blair not guilty a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .
but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .

and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .
" sardinia , just nine kilometers away , has enjoyed autonomy since 1948 and has no independence seekers , " he said . colonna 's capture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna commentators have put forward various theories for vote 's failure , which came hot on the heels of friday 's capture of corsica 's most wanted separatist , yvan colonna -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is suspected of murdering the island ’ s paris-installed governor claude erignac in 1998 . “ if paris wanted to support the “ no ” camp , they couldn ’ t have come up with a better method , ” corsican nationalist jean guy talamoni told the german news agency dpa , referring to colonna ’ s arrest . other observers mooted many corsicans did support the plans for greater autonomy , but were fearful of being allied with radical rival nationalist groups .
and some believe corsicans were simply put off the plans for change , fearing civil service job losses once the proposals were implemented . corsica - napoleon 's birthplace and a tourist attraction - has suffered years of bomb attacks and violence by rival separatist movements .
the latest cycle of violence began in the mid-1970s when the murder of two policemen began a guerilla campaign to gain independence from france .
most of the 270,000 who live on corsica do not support the campaign , but fear openly saying so . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down came as a massive blow . failed power play ? " there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east runs as high as 18 percent in some areas .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence . a committee of the british house of commons on monday cleared prime minister tony blair and senior ministers of accusations aired by the bbc that they misled the public over the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but the committee criticized the government for its handling of intelligence information , which led blair to unwittingly misinform parliament about its reasons for going to war .
" we conclude that ministers did not mislead parliament , " said donald anderson , the labor party chairman of the investigative committee .
the eagerly awaited 60-page report , released on monday , was the result of an investigation into the government 's decision to go to war against iraq .
the committee 's probe covered two separate dossiers in which the government alleged saddam hussein was capable of deploying such weapons within 45 minutes .
and though the report largely cleared blair of the charges , it did find fault in the report and said that it could not corroborate the reliability of its contents .
" we conclude that the 45-minute claim did not warrant the prominence given to it in the dossier because it was based on intelligence from a single , uncorroborated source , " the committee members wrote in their report .
the committee recommended , but did not demand , an explanation from the government on why it relied on the information and placed such an emphasis on it .
" there were allegations that it was embellished or exaggerated in order to make a stronger case .
the committee concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that this did not happen , " he said .
the allegations damaged the reputation of blair 's government and also plunged it into an ugly battle against its own national broadcaster , the bbc .
it also raised serious questions about the arguments made by both britain and the united states to topple saddam 's government .
aide cleared of misdoing the committee also concluded that downing street communications director alistair campbell , did not play any role in the decision to include the 45-minute claim and that he " did not exert or seek to exert improper influence in its drafting .
however , we do have some concerns about his role in chairing a meeting on an intelligence matter . "
anderson said that " in all probability , " the september report accurately reflected the intelligence that was available at the time .
on monday , senior british officials used the report 's findings as an opportunity to again demand an apology from the bbc for its reports that senior blair aids sought to " sex up " the report by including the 45-minute weapons of mass destruction claim . ministers , including foreign secretary jack straw , said the report vindicated campbell and the government and that the bbc should apologize for its " fundamental attack on the integrity of the prime minister and the government . "
" i believe that the bbc should now apologize , " he said .
" and i note that even the bbc governors in their statement last night did not defend the accuracy of this claim .
the bbc should now have the grace to acknowledge that they got it wrong . "
bbc stands behind story but bbc 's director of news , richard sambrooke , said the report , issued by a committee " deeply divided " on whether to exonerate campbell , vindicated the bbc 's decision to cite an unnamed senior intelligence source who claimed the document had been altered at campbell 's request .
bbc chairman gavin davies , meanwhile , described the broadcaster 's coverage of the war as " entirely impartial " and called on campbell to withdraw his allegations of bias against the bbc and its journalists .
but with the government position firmly entrenched , it 's unlikely campbell will do so .
addressing the controversy himself over the weekend , prime minister blair dismissed reports campbell had manipulated intelligence information as " absurd . "
on monday , campbell repeated his accusations against the bbc .
" the bbc has not provided a shred of evidence to substantiate the story , " campbell said .
" i think when fair and reasonable people see the evidence , they will realized that the story is n't true and the bbc should admit that . "
nevertheless , the foreign affairs committee 's report does n't entirely exonerate blair 's government .
some opposition parliamentarians from the conservative party claimed there was n't enough evidence to clear the allegations against campbell or to issue a definitive judgement about the bbc 's report .
the vote was split down party lines , showing just how deep the divisions were within the committee .
the committee also accused the government of plagiarism , saying it lifted the heart of a second dossier released in february – which downing street presented as new intelligence information – from a student 's thesis and interwove it with intelligence data .

peters once again denied accusations of deception relating to the failed metalworkers ’ strike in eastern germany . he also accused zwickel of " insinuation " and spreading " mistruths . "
" everyone involved was well-enough informed .
the accusation of deception is mean-spirited and comes completely out of thin air , " peters said at a press conference held in frankfurt .
" whoever made up these accusations is clearly only interested in damaging my personal integrity in the organization . ”
at the same time , 59-year-old peters conceded that ig metall had suffered “ a painful defeat in the most recent labor dispute . ” he said he would be interested in an " unsparing analysis " of the lost strike , and would be happy to do his part for one .
peters also reiterated that he would seek the chairmanship when zwickel retires in october and denied rumors that he would step down from his current position as deputy . " i am not the desired candidate " “ everyone knows that i am not the desired candidate of klaus zwickel . but there ’ s nothing i can do about that , ” peters said .
peters said he expected that at the latest , zwickel will take back his accusations following the board meeting on tuesday .
by then , peters will have presented his detailed assessment of the strike defeat . until now , only the ten managing members of the ig metall supervisory board had discussed the strike .
specifically , zwickel accused peters and the union 's berlin district leader hasso düvel , who together were responsible for the strike , to have misled the union leadership about the effect that the eastern german action would have on western germany . the work stoppage at the facilities of eastern german suppliers meant that production was interrupted at a number of western german factories .
placing the blame according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper , peters had his wages group write a report on the failed strike stating that peters was not solely responsible for the failed strike .
instead , it said , there was plenty of blame to go around .
the report concedes that the leadership made errors , the newspaper said , but lays the true fault for the failed strike on “ outside circumstances . ” if anyone is at fault , then it is the whole management board , the report concluded . in june , ig metall took to the picket lines to cut the work week in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours in an effort to bring labor practices in line with those in the west .
the union said the difference creates a “ fairness gap , ” but employers fought cutting the hours until the end , saying it would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . the strike , which hit automobile production across the country , was finally called off on june 28 after marathon negotiations with employers failed to yield a breakthrough .
for ig metall , which last experienced an unsuccessful strike in 1954 , the embarrassing climb-down came as a massive blow . failed power play ? " there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east runs as high as 18 percent in some areas .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

" there ’ s no doubt that ig metall miscalculated - we misjudged the political situation and we estimated that the economic situation in germany was more positive , ” union spokesman claus eilrich said last week . some observers think peters was hoping to use the strike to help build his own profile before taking over the helm from zwickel , who is retiring in october . the latest strike had been highly unpopular with businesses , the government and the public , as it was seen as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn .
unemployment in the former communist east runs as high as 18 percent in some areas .
but the defeat also comes at a difficult time for ig metall and other unions after their recent failed efforts to block the government ’ s economic reform proposals and social welfare cuts . in addition to tarnishing the union 's public image , many ig metall members also fear that the failed strike has badly weakened the union ’ s position in any future negotiations with employers or the government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

there are four to five million muslims in france , but only recently have they had a television station to call their own .
but beur tv is not simply an al jazeera knockoff . launched in march 2003 , beur tv is targeted at muslims in both france and north africa .
the word “ beur ” is “ arab ” as spoken in a popular french slang that inverts words , and is a bit like a mix of cockney rhyming and pig latin . programs on beur tv can be heard in arabic and berber , but most are in french . the range of programming is wide . there is a show on beauty , sports programs , movies , and lots of current affairs . the brainchild of producer nacer kettane , who started a successful radio station called radio beur in the 1980s , the station is aimed at muslims not only in france but in algeria , tunisia and morocco as well – the former french colonies in the maghreb region of north africa . ' we are french ' beur tv will differ from al jazeera , the well-known arab-language news channel from qatar , kettane said .
for one thing , the two stations serve very different audiences .
“ we are different from al jazeera , ” kettane told deutsche welle .
“ we are muslims in europe .
we came from north africa , but we live in france .
we are french , you know . " france has had other channels catering to muslims in the past .
one was funded by saudi arabia , another by algeria . but kettane hopes beur tv will enjoy total editorial independence , since the station expects to cover its annual € 5 million budget entirely by advertising . the precedent is encouraging .
radio beur started as a semi-professional community radio station in the 1980s , and now it is a successful business with listeners on both sides of the mediterranean . the station ’ s assistant director arlette casas said she is confident the advertisers will come . “ the advertising market in the maghreb region is very large and expanding .
because of their economic systems , these people have n't bought very much .
and now those countries are opening up through globalization .
so there is huge potential . " a question of identity but for those involved , beur tv is much more than a business proposition .
it 's about cultural expression and community identity - a venture that goes to the heart of the raging debate on immigration and identity in france . france has become a multicultural nation over the years , but you 'd never know it by watching television . although muslims are around eight percent of the country 's population , few of the people shown on camera are of immigrant background , with sports and comedy the notable exceptions .
football player zinedine zidane , whose parents were algerian , or successful comics like jamel debbouze , of moroccan descent , are revered as heroes .
but it 's still rare to see muslims in many mainstream television shows . catherine de wenden , a researcher specializing in immigration issues , says french muslims want to make their presence felt in society . " they have the feeling that they are not represented in french broadcasts .
so perhaps they wanted to show they exist as a community .
and also to give legitimacy to their objective of being muslims while being french . " le mix many of france 's muslims watch moroccan or algerian television on cable or satellite .
but these stations do n't accurately reflect their unique mix of french and muslim influences either , de wenden says . " most of them want to express their culture , and they want to propose a culture that is a mix of french and maghreban .
so this has nothing to do with saudi arabia , nothing to do with other areas , ” she said . at beur tv , such cultural expression takes many forms .
take , for example , the fashion and beauty show beau , belle , beur , which translates to handsome , beautiful , - and beur . it is hosted and produced by leila talla , a journalist of algerian heritage .
she worked for years at a women 's beauty magazine , and her show aims to look at fashion and beauty from a french muslim perspective . so far , episodes have focused on lingerie , hamams -lrb- traditional north african steam baths , -rrb- and weddings . “ i mixed the middle eastern wedding wear with western wear - the seven outfits a middle eastern bride must wear before putting on here white dress , ” talla said .
“ and i did a report on western wedding dresses by visiting a well-known gown designer here in paris and also a large discount store for wedding gowns .

the voters of corsica rejected a french offer of limited autonomy by a narrow margin in referendum on sunday , after the capture of the troubled island 's most wanted separatist . almost 51 percent of corsicans voted " no " to french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's proposals to scrap two administrative departments on the island , create an elected assembly in the city of ajaccio and give wider powers over tax , tourism and environmental issues and force corsica 's political elite to adopt participation quotas for women . just over 49 percent of voters cast a " yes " vote for the plans .
paris said turnout was 60 percent .
the margin of victory was a wafer-thin 2,190 votes . corsica was due to be the first french region to benefit under the government 's plans for wider decentralization in france , which is hoped will reduce state spending and increase efficiency .
the proposals had been billed as a chance for the island - which lies 160 kilometers off the french côte d 'azure - to restore peace and prosperity after years of mafia-style separatist violence there . french president jacques chirac in a statement regretted the result , but said the french government would continue to support the island and help combat any violence .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who had been at the forefront of the " yes " campaign , called the outcome a " personal defeat . " on the eve of the vote , sarkozy had pointed to the neighboring italian island of sardinia , saying it set an example of what corsica could enjoy .
" sardinia , just nine kilometers away , has enjoyed autonomy since 1948 and has no independence seekers , " he said . colonna 's capture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yvan colonna commentators have put forward various theories for vote 's failure , which came hot on the heels of friday 's capture of corsica 's most wanted separatist , yvan colonna -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is suspected of murdering the island ’ s paris-installed governor claude erignac in 1998 . “ if paris wanted to support the “ no ” camp , they couldn ’ t have come up with a better method , ” corsican nationalist jean guy talamoni told the german news agency dpa , referring to colonna ’ s arrest . other observers mooted many corsicans did support the plans for greater autonomy , but were fearful of being allied with radical rival nationalist groups .
and some believe corsicans were simply put off the plans for change , fearing civil service job losses once the proposals were implemented . corsica - napoleon 's birthplace and a tourist attraction - has suffered years of bomb attacks and violence by rival separatist movements .
the latest cycle of violence began in the mid-1970s when the murder of two policemen began a guerilla campaign to gain independence from france .

but sir bob scott - who fought two olympic campaigns for manchester - admits the phone in his office has not been ringing too much of late .
sir bob scott 's career 1967 - arrives in manchester to head the 69 theatre company 1976 - sets up the royal exchange theatre 1985 - forms manchester olympic bid committee 1994 - knighted in the new years honours list 1995 - wins commonwealth games 2002 for manchester 1996 - wins millennium festival for greenwich 2003 - wins capital of culture 2008 for liverpool not that the man who bought the commonwealth games to the city and who is on first name terms with many international olympic committee members is complaining .
because sir bob - as his staff affectionately call him - is still busy , having decided to stay in charge of liverpool 's successful capital of culture 2008 team .
but the 59-year-old admits he wants to be involved in the capital 's olympic bid , which , he fears , has little chance of success after the " disastrous " world cup and world athletics championship bids .
" i 'm quite surprised i have n't been invited aboard the process , " he says .
" if i was them , i would want to talk with somebody who has been through it twice before . "
gracefully , he says the london team is " getting its feet under the table " and may get in touch .
you get the impression he is not holding out much hope - but london 's loss will probably turn out to be the north west 's gain .
because sir bob has done more than most to eradicate its flat cap and cobbled street image .
arriving in manchester in 1967 after acting in the west end , the british diplomat 's son began a " 35-year love affair " with the city .
manchester 's commonwealth games was hailed a success he launched the city 's royal exchange theatre and the revival of manchester 's other two major theatres , the palace and the opera house .
then , in 1984 , he had an idea that , in the minds of many , marked him down as a mad man .
" everyone was saying what great shape the olympics were in after los angeles in 1984 following the problems during the 1970s , " he says .
" i decided that the demographic of manchester was rather similar to los angeles .
" people thought i was an absolute lunatic , but it grew and grew and , whenever i expected a door to be closed in our face , it was opened . "
as chairman of the city 's bid committee , he lost out to atlanta and sydney for the 1996 and 2000 games .
i would n't be a very good retired person - i 'm not particularly looking forward to gardening and reading sir bob scott but the campaigns raised the city 's profile and triggered its regeneration .
despite a brief sabbatical to bring the millennium festival to greenwich - this adopted northerner is now back in liverpool .
many hope the capital of culture will change the city 's image for good , as it did for glasgow in the 1990s .
he says : " i do n't subscribe to the view that glasgow was a success because the culture prize was a novelty and that therefore liverpool will not be so successful .
" very few cities play better internationally than they do nationally .
" but if you ask an american about liverpool , they see it as the home of the beatles and as the source of so much maritime immigration , while in europe it is known for its football . "
maybe after 2008 he will call it a day and spend more time with his wife , alicia , in their home in greenwich .
liverpool 's capital of culture win was sir bob scott 's latest success certainly he will keep alive his two passions : sport and music .
" watching seb coe win gold medals and listening to pavarotti for me are very similar experiences " says the man who also cites i 'm looking through you and all you need is love as his favourite beatles songs .
but despite being on medication after suffering a heart attack last november , he insists he has no plans to slow down .
" the heart attack did give me a sharp kick in the bottom and i have changed my lifestyle in some ways , " he says .
" but i am 59 and i 've got to earn my living .
" anyway , i would n't be a very good retired person - i 'm not particularly looking forward to gardening and reading . "

but sir bob scott - who fought two olympic campaigns for manchester - admits the phone in his office has not been ringing too much of late .
sir bob scott 's career 1967 - arrives in manchester to head the 69 theatre company 1976 - sets up the royal exchange theatre 1985 - forms manchester olympic bid committee 1994 - knighted in the new years honours list 1995 - wins commonwealth games 2002 for manchester 1996 - wins millennium festival for greenwich 2003 - wins capital of culture 2008 for liverpool not that the man who bought the commonwealth games to the city and who is on first name terms with many international olympic committee members is complaining .
because sir bob - as his staff affectionately call him - is still busy , having decided to stay in charge of liverpool 's successful capital of culture 2008 team .
but the 59-year-old admits he wants to be involved in the capital 's olympic bid , which , he fears , has little chance of success after the " disastrous " world cup and world athletics championship bids .
" i 'm quite surprised i have n't been invited aboard the process , " he says .
" if i was them , i would want to talk with somebody who has been through it twice before . "
gracefully , he says the london team is " getting its feet under the table " and may get in touch .
you get the impression he is not holding out much hope - but london 's loss will probably turn out to be the north west 's gain .
because sir bob has done more than most to eradicate its flat cap and cobbled street image .
arriving in manchester in 1967 after acting in the west end , the british diplomat 's son began a " 35-year love affair " with the city .
manchester 's commonwealth games was hailed a success he launched the city 's royal exchange theatre and the revival of manchester 's other two major theatres , the palace and the opera house .
then , in 1984 , he had an idea that , in the minds of many , marked him down as a mad man .
" everyone was saying what great shape the olympics were in after los angeles in 1984 following the problems during the 1970s , " he says .
" i decided that the demographic of manchester was rather similar to los angeles .
" people thought i was an absolute lunatic , but it grew and grew and , whenever i expected a door to be closed in our face , it was opened . "
as chairman of the city 's bid committee , he lost out to atlanta and sydney for the 1996 and 2000 games .
i would n't be a very good retired person - i 'm not particularly looking forward to gardening and reading sir bob scott but the campaigns raised the city 's profile and triggered its regeneration .
despite a brief sabbatical to bring the millennium festival to greenwich - this adopted northerner is now back in liverpool .
many hope the capital of culture will change the city 's image for good , as it did for glasgow in the 1990s .
he says : " i do n't subscribe to the view that glasgow was a success because the culture prize was a novelty and that therefore liverpool will not be so successful .
" very few cities play better internationally than they do nationally .
" but if you ask an american about liverpool , they see it as the home of the beatles and as the source of so much maritime immigration , while in europe it is known for its football . "
maybe after 2008 he will call it a day and spend more time with his wife , alicia , in their home in greenwich .
liverpool 's capital of culture win was sir bob scott 's latest success certainly he will keep alive his two passions : sport and music .
" watching seb coe win gold medals and listening to pavarotti for me are very similar experiences " says the man who also cites i 'm looking through you and all you need is love as his favourite beatles songs .
but despite being on medication after suffering a heart attack last november , he insists he has no plans to slow down .

but sir bob scott - who fought two olympic campaigns for manchester - admits the phone in his office has not been ringing too much of late .
sir bob scott 's career 1967 - arrives in manchester to head the 69 theatre company 1976 - sets up the royal exchange theatre 1985 - forms manchester olympic bid committee 1994 - knighted in the new years honours list 1995 - wins commonwealth games 2002 for manchester 1996 - wins millennium festival for greenwich 2003 - wins capital of culture 2008 for liverpool not that the man who bought the commonwealth games to the city and who is on first name terms with many international olympic committee members is complaining .
because sir bob - as his staff affectionately call him - is still busy , having decided to stay in charge of liverpool 's successful capital of culture 2008 team .
but the 59-year-old admits he wants to be involved in the capital 's olympic bid , which , he fears , has little chance of success after the " disastrous " world cup and world athletics championship bids .
" i 'm quite surprised i have n't been invited aboard the process , " he says .
" if i was them , i would want to talk with somebody who has been through it twice before . "
gracefully , he says the london team is " getting its feet under the table " and may get in touch .
you get the impression he is not holding out much hope - but london 's loss will probably turn out to be the north west 's gain .
because sir bob has done more than most to eradicate its flat cap and cobbled street image .
arriving in manchester in 1967 after acting in the west end , the british diplomat 's son began a " 35-year love affair " with the city .
manchester 's commonwealth games was hailed a success he launched the city 's royal exchange theatre and the revival of manchester 's other two major theatres , the palace and the opera house .
then , in 1984 , he had an idea that , in the minds of many , marked him down as a mad man .
" everyone was saying what great shape the olympics were in after los angeles in 1984 following the problems during the 1970s , " he says .
" i decided that the demographic of manchester was rather similar to los angeles .
" people thought i was an absolute lunatic , but it grew and grew and , whenever i expected a door to be closed in our face , it was opened . "
as chairman of the city 's bid committee , he lost out to atlanta and sydney for the 1996 and 2000 games .
i would n't be a very good retired person - i 'm not particularly looking forward to gardening and reading sir bob scott but the campaigns raised the city 's profile and triggered its regeneration .
despite a brief sabbatical to bring the millennium festival to greenwich - this adopted northerner is now back in liverpool .
many hope the capital of culture will change the city 's image for good , as it did for glasgow in the 1990s .
he says : " i do n't subscribe to the view that glasgow was a success because the culture prize was a novelty and that therefore liverpool will not be so successful .
" very few cities play better internationally than they do nationally .
" but if you ask an american about liverpool , they see it as the home of the beatles and as the source of so much maritime immigration , while in europe it is known for its football . "
maybe after 2008 he will call it a day and spend more time with his wife , alicia , in their home in greenwich .
liverpool 's capital of culture win was sir bob scott 's latest success certainly he will keep alive his two passions : sport and music .
" watching seb coe win gold medals and listening to pavarotti for me are very similar experiences " says the man who also cites i 'm looking through you and all you need is love as his favourite beatles songs .
but despite being on medication after suffering a heart attack last november , he insists he has no plans to slow down .
" the heart attack did give me a sharp kick in the bottom and i have changed my lifestyle in some ways , " he says .
" but i am 59 and i 've got to earn my living .
" anyway , i would n't be a very good retired person - i 'm not particularly looking forward to gardening and reading . "
