but after a report surfaced in a british tabloid newspaper earlier this month alleging schröder 's fourth marriage was in trouble , that 's exactly what he got .
now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .
mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .
we feel sorry for our german colleagues who are limited by oppressive laws , and prevented from doing their jobs properly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone is fair game in the tabloids .
the mail on sunday , along with the rest the british press , is not bound by privacy rules .
the paper is considered a robust member of the country 's mass circulation press that largely regards politicians ' private lives as fair game .
schröder now faces a battle against britain 's legal system .
schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .
" i would reckon that there will be another round , " said the source .
" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .
but that is no reason whatsoever to publish lies , and if that is the case then one will take action . "
when asked by the guardian if the chancellor was angry , the source said : " yes .
he is . "
in an official statement , the german government 's spokesman said : " we reject the allegation of censorship .
this was a sovereign and independent decision of the german courts .
the allegations will rebound on those who have made them . "
legal experts say germans must go to british court in order to stop the mail on sunday or any other british newspaper from going further , schröder would have to obtain an injunction in the english courts .
but the chances of this happening are slim because of the lack of privacy laws in britain .
geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .
" but that course would require admitting the story was true . "
after four marriages , the latest to doris schröder-kopf , a woman 19 years his junior , schröder 's love life is source of interest , even within his own country .
he is already widely dubbed the " audi chancellor " - the trademark rings of the german car manufacturer symbolizing his four wedding rings - and is currently facing a similar legal battle with two german newspapers .
the chancellor also went to court last year to quash speculation that he dyes his hair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de playing the media game germany 's self-proclaimed media chancellor , gerhard schröder , loves to be in the spotlight .

now they are each others ' most important market . forty years ago , on january 22 , 1963 , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer signed the elysée treaty .
for decades before germany and france had been archenemies .
the franco-german friendship treaty was meant to change that through extensive cooperation on a political , economic and cultural basis .
the germans and french did n't just get to know each other better through educational exchanges or the joint television network arte .
the franco-german partnership also established the foundation for the political and economic union of europe .
the two countries are now each others ' most important trade and economic partner .
the statistics speak for themselves .
import and exports german cars are in high demand in france , while french cars lead german automotive imports .
last year 328,000 german cars were delivered to customers in france ; 254,000 french cars went to german customers .
cars are the leading item in bilateral trade , followed by machines , chemicals and pharmaceuticals , electrical products and foodstuffs .
on the french market german furniture is just as sought-after as washing machines .
in germany french wine and champagne have many adherents .
according to giselher schlebusch , spokesman for the franco-german chamber of commerce and industry in paris , absolutely everything is traded between the two countries – from raw products to high tech products .
give and take germany traditionally records a surplus in the bilateral trade balance : in 2001 it was up to € 20 billion -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- .
german exports to france were worth € 69 billion , while french exports to germany made up € 49 billion .
the bilateral balance increased only slightly last year due to economic problems in both countries .
while 16.8 percent of french imports come from germany , 14.6 percent of french exports go to germany .
the french portion of german export and imports is n't as high : france has an 11 percent share in german foreign trade .
thoroughly entrenched german-french market activities are promoted and supported by vast investments .
french investments in germany amount to € 30 billion .
german firms have invested around € 25 billion in subsidiaries in france .
the palette of subsidiaries ranges from sales offices and service points to large industrial facilities .
1400 german firms from all possible branches are members of the chamber of commerce in paris , and according to giselher schlebusch , the majority are subsidiaries that have been around for many years .
schlebusch believes that that fact alone is a sign of economic success , since the firms would have otherwise withdrawn from the market long ago .
though well-known companies are represented in the chamber , mainly small and medium-sized firms maintain distribution offices and production facilities in the neighboring country .
each year around 100 german companies invest in the french market .
the german firm bosch , known for home appliances , tools and automotive equipment , has 15,000 employees in france ; siemens , the german engineering giant , has more than 10,000 workers there .
nearly every french car is constructed using parts made in germany .
daimlerchrysler assembles the smart car in france .
the 2,700 german companies in france employ 300,000 people , while the 1,300 french firms in germany have 230,000 employees .
in the upper echelons of leadership , however , managers from the neighboring country are still a rare sight . karl zawadzky send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the franco-german chamber of commerce -lrb- in french and german -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.01.2003 german leader in the ring with british press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloves are off after allegations about his private life surfaced in a british newspaper , gerhard schröder secured an injunction against the mail on sunday but the legal fight drags on . with plenty of distractions on the international and domestic political stage keeping him occupied , the last thing german chancellor gerhard schröder wanted was a fight on a third front .
but after a report surfaced in a british tabloid newspaper earlier this month alleging schröder 's fourth marriage was in trouble , that 's exactly what he got .
now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .
mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .
we feel sorry for our german colleagues who are limited by oppressive laws , and prevented from doing their jobs properly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone is fair game in the tabloids .
the mail on sunday , along with the rest the british press , is not bound by privacy rules .
the paper is considered a robust member of the country 's mass circulation press that largely regards politicians ' private lives as fair game .
schröder now faces a battle against britain 's legal system .
schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .
" i would reckon that there will be another round , " said the source .
" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .
but that is no reason whatsoever to publish lies , and if that is the case then one will take action . "
when asked by the guardian if the chancellor was angry , the source said : " yes .
he is . "
in an official statement , the german government 's spokesman said : " we reject the allegation of censorship .
this was a sovereign and independent decision of the german courts .
the allegations will rebound on those who have made them . "
legal experts say germans must go to british court in order to stop the mail on sunday or any other british newspaper from going further , schröder would have to obtain an injunction in the english courts .
but the chances of this happening are slim because of the lack of privacy laws in britain .
geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .
" but that course would require admitting the story was true . "
after four marriages , the latest to doris schröder-kopf , a woman 19 years his junior , schröder 's love life is source of interest , even within his own country .
he is already widely dubbed the " audi chancellor " - the trademark rings of the german car manufacturer symbolizing his four wedding rings - and is currently facing a similar legal battle with two german newspapers .

now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .
mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .

geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .

mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .
we feel sorry for our german colleagues who are limited by oppressive laws , and prevented from doing their jobs properly . "

geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .

now they are each others ' most important market . forty years ago , on january 22 , 1963 , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer signed the elysée treaty .
for decades before germany and france had been archenemies .
the franco-german friendship treaty was meant to change that through extensive cooperation on a political , economic and cultural basis .
the germans and french did n't just get to know each other better through educational exchanges or the joint television network arte .
the franco-german partnership also established the foundation for the political and economic union of europe .
the two countries are now each others ' most important trade and economic partner .
the statistics speak for themselves .
import and exports german cars are in high demand in france , while french cars lead german automotive imports .
last year 328,000 german cars were delivered to customers in france ; 254,000 french cars went to german customers .
cars are the leading item in bilateral trade , followed by machines , chemicals and pharmaceuticals , electrical products and foodstuffs .
on the french market german furniture is just as sought-after as washing machines .
in germany french wine and champagne have many adherents .
according to giselher schlebusch , spokesman for the franco-german chamber of commerce and industry in paris , absolutely everything is traded between the two countries – from raw products to high tech products .
give and take germany traditionally records a surplus in the bilateral trade balance : in 2001 it was up to € 20 billion -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- .
german exports to france were worth € 69 billion , while french exports to germany made up € 49 billion .
the bilateral balance increased only slightly last year due to economic problems in both countries .
while 16.8 percent of french imports come from germany , 14.6 percent of french exports go to germany .
the french portion of german export and imports is n't as high : france has an 11 percent share in german foreign trade .
thoroughly entrenched german-french market activities are promoted and supported by vast investments .
french investments in germany amount to € 30 billion .
german firms have invested around € 25 billion in subsidiaries in france .
the palette of subsidiaries ranges from sales offices and service points to large industrial facilities .
1400 german firms from all possible branches are members of the chamber of commerce in paris , and according to giselher schlebusch , the majority are subsidiaries that have been around for many years .
schlebusch believes that that fact alone is a sign of economic success , since the firms would have otherwise withdrawn from the market long ago .
though well-known companies are represented in the chamber , mainly small and medium-sized firms maintain distribution offices and production facilities in the neighboring country .
each year around 100 german companies invest in the french market .
the german firm bosch , known for home appliances , tools and automotive equipment , has 15,000 employees in france ; siemens , the german engineering giant , has more than 10,000 workers there .
nearly every french car is constructed using parts made in germany .
daimlerchrysler assembles the smart car in france .
the 2,700 german companies in france employ 300,000 people , while the 1,300 french firms in germany have 230,000 employees .

but after a report surfaced in a british tabloid newspaper earlier this month alleging schröder 's fourth marriage was in trouble , that 's exactly what he got .
now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .
mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .
we feel sorry for our german colleagues who are limited by oppressive laws , and prevented from doing their jobs properly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone is fair game in the tabloids .
the mail on sunday , along with the rest the british press , is not bound by privacy rules .
the paper is considered a robust member of the country 's mass circulation press that largely regards politicians ' private lives as fair game .
schröder now faces a battle against britain 's legal system .
schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .
" i would reckon that there will be another round , " said the source .
" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .
but that is no reason whatsoever to publish lies , and if that is the case then one will take action . "
when asked by the guardian if the chancellor was angry , the source said : " yes .
he is . "
in an official statement , the german government 's spokesman said : " we reject the allegation of censorship .
this was a sovereign and independent decision of the german courts .
the allegations will rebound on those who have made them . "
legal experts say germans must go to british court in order to stop the mail on sunday or any other british newspaper from going further , schröder would have to obtain an injunction in the english courts .
but the chances of this happening are slim because of the lack of privacy laws in britain .
geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .
" but that course would require admitting the story was true . "
after four marriages , the latest to doris schröder-kopf , a woman 19 years his junior , schröder 's love life is source of interest , even within his own country .
he is already widely dubbed the " audi chancellor " - the trademark rings of the german car manufacturer symbolizing his four wedding rings - and is currently facing a similar legal battle with two german newspapers .

the franco-german partnership also established the foundation for the political and economic union of europe .
the two countries are now each others ' most important trade and economic partner .
the statistics speak for themselves .
import and exports german cars are in high demand in france , while french cars lead german automotive imports .
last year 328,000 german cars were delivered to customers in france ; 254,000 french cars went to german customers .
cars are the leading item in bilateral trade , followed by machines , chemicals and pharmaceuticals , electrical products and foodstuffs .

though well-known companies are represented in the chamber , mainly small and medium-sized firms maintain distribution offices and production facilities in the neighboring country .

however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .

it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .

schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .

" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .

geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.01.2003 german leader in the ring with british press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloves are off after allegations about his private life surfaced in a british newspaper , gerhard schröder secured an injunction against the mail on sunday but the legal fight drags on . with plenty of distractions on the international and domestic political stage keeping him occupied , the last thing german chancellor gerhard schröder wanted was a fight on a third front .
but after a report surfaced in a british tabloid newspaper earlier this month alleging schröder 's fourth marriage was in trouble , that 's exactly what he got .
now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .
mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .
we feel sorry for our german colleagues who are limited by oppressive laws , and prevented from doing their jobs properly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone is fair game in the tabloids .
the mail on sunday , along with the rest the british press , is not bound by privacy rules .
the paper is considered a robust member of the country 's mass circulation press that largely regards politicians ' private lives as fair game .
schröder now faces a battle against britain 's legal system .
schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .
" i would reckon that there will be another round , " said the source .
" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .
but that is no reason whatsoever to publish lies , and if that is the case then one will take action . "
when asked by the guardian if the chancellor was angry , the source said : " yes .
he is . "
in an official statement , the german government 's spokesman said : " we reject the allegation of censorship .
this was a sovereign and independent decision of the german courts .
the allegations will rebound on those who have made them . "
legal experts say germans must go to british court in order to stop the mail on sunday or any other british newspaper from going further , schröder would have to obtain an injunction in the english courts .
but the chances of this happening are slim because of the lack of privacy laws in britain .
geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .
" but that course would require admitting the story was true . "
after four marriages , the latest to doris schröder-kopf , a woman 19 years his junior , schröder 's love life is source of interest , even within his own country .

but after a report surfaced in a british tabloid newspaper earlier this month alleging schröder 's fourth marriage was in trouble , that 's exactly what he got .
now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .
mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .
we feel sorry for our german colleagues who are limited by oppressive laws , and prevented from doing their jobs properly . "

the paper is considered a robust member of the country 's mass circulation press that largely regards politicians ' private lives as fair game .
schröder now faces a battle against britain 's legal system .
schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .
" i would reckon that there will be another round , " said the source .
" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .
but that is no reason whatsoever to publish lies , and if that is the case then one will take action . "
when asked by the guardian if the chancellor was angry , the source said : " yes .
he is . "
in an official statement , the german government 's spokesman said : " we reject the allegation of censorship .
this was a sovereign and independent decision of the german courts .
the allegations will rebound on those who have made them . "
legal experts say germans must go to british court in order to stop the mail on sunday or any other british newspaper from going further , schröder would have to obtain an injunction in the english courts .
but the chances of this happening are slim because of the lack of privacy laws in britain .
geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .
" but that course would require admitting the story was true . "
after four marriages , the latest to doris schröder-kopf , a woman 19 years his junior , schröder 's love life is source of interest , even within his own country .

now they are each others ' most important market . forty years ago , on january 22 , 1963 , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer signed the elysée treaty .
for decades before germany and france had been archenemies .
the franco-german friendship treaty was meant to change that through extensive cooperation on a political , economic and cultural basis .
the germans and french did n't just get to know each other better through educational exchanges or the joint television network arte .
the franco-german partnership also established the foundation for the political and economic union of europe .
the two countries are now each others ' most important trade and economic partner .
the statistics speak for themselves .
import and exports german cars are in high demand in france , while french cars lead german automotive imports .
last year 328,000 german cars were delivered to customers in france ; 254,000 french cars went to german customers .
cars are the leading item in bilateral trade , followed by machines , chemicals and pharmaceuticals , electrical products and foodstuffs .
on the french market german furniture is just as sought-after as washing machines .
in germany french wine and champagne have many adherents .
according to giselher schlebusch , spokesman for the franco-german chamber of commerce and industry in paris , absolutely everything is traded between the two countries – from raw products to high tech products .
give and take germany traditionally records a surplus in the bilateral trade balance : in 2001 it was up to € 20 billion -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- .
german exports to france were worth € 69 billion , while french exports to germany made up € 49 billion .
the bilateral balance increased only slightly last year due to economic problems in both countries .
while 16.8 percent of french imports come from germany , 14.6 percent of french exports go to germany .
the french portion of german export and imports is n't as high : france has an 11 percent share in german foreign trade .
thoroughly entrenched german-french market activities are promoted and supported by vast investments .
french investments in germany amount to € 30 billion .
german firms have invested around € 25 billion in subsidiaries in france .
the palette of subsidiaries ranges from sales offices and service points to large industrial facilities .
1400 german firms from all possible branches are members of the chamber of commerce in paris , and according to giselher schlebusch , the majority are subsidiaries that have been around for many years .
schlebusch believes that that fact alone is a sign of economic success , since the firms would have otherwise withdrawn from the market long ago .
though well-known companies are represented in the chamber , mainly small and medium-sized firms maintain distribution offices and production facilities in the neighboring country .
each year around 100 german companies invest in the french market .
the german firm bosch , known for home appliances , tools and automotive equipment , has 15,000 employees in france ; siemens , the german engineering giant , has more than 10,000 workers there .
nearly every french car is constructed using parts made in germany .
daimlerchrysler assembles the smart car in france .
the 2,700 german companies in france employ 300,000 people , while the 1,300 french firms in germany have 230,000 employees .

mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .
we feel sorry for our german colleagues who are limited by oppressive laws , and prevented from doing their jobs properly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone is fair game in the tabloids .
the mail on sunday , along with the rest the british press , is not bound by privacy rules .
the paper is considered a robust member of the country 's mass circulation press that largely regards politicians ' private lives as fair game .
schröder now faces a battle against britain 's legal system .
schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .
" i would reckon that there will be another round , " said the source .
" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .
but that is no reason whatsoever to publish lies , and if that is the case then one will take action . "
when asked by the guardian if the chancellor was angry , the source said : " yes .
he is . "
in an official statement , the german government 's spokesman said : " we reject the allegation of censorship .
this was a sovereign and independent decision of the german courts .
the allegations will rebound on those who have made them . "
legal experts say germans must go to british court in order to stop the mail on sunday or any other british newspaper from going further , schröder would have to obtain an injunction in the english courts .
but the chances of this happening are slim because of the lack of privacy laws in britain .
geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .
" but that course would require admitting the story was true . "
after four marriages , the latest to doris schröder-kopf , a woman 19 years his junior , schröder 's love life is source of interest , even within his own country .
he is already widely dubbed the " audi chancellor " - the trademark rings of the german car manufacturer symbolizing his four wedding rings - and is currently facing a similar legal battle with two german newspapers .

but after a report surfaced in a british tabloid newspaper earlier this month alleging schröder 's fourth marriage was in trouble , that 's exactly what he got .
now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .

but after a report surfaced in a british tabloid newspaper earlier this month alleging schröder 's fourth marriage was in trouble , that 's exactly what he got .
now the chancellor finds himself embroiled in a legal battle to clear his name and gag the mail on sunday from any further personal revelations - truthful or not .
however , although his influence may stretch from the bundestag to the united nations security council , it seems to hold little sway with the british legal system that is currently preventing any german plans to prevent further articles by the popular british newspaper .
the mail on sunday printed a story on january 5 that romantically linked schröder to a well-known german television interviewer .
the infuriated chancellor then took the issue to court in a bid to silence the newspaper .
schröder 's lawyer announced on friday that the action had been successful and that the chancellor had won a temporary injunction from a hamburg court ordering the mail on sunday not to repeat any of the six points referred to in the story .
mail on sunday bites back after temporary injunction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and doris schröder-kopf deny a split .
under the terms of the injunction , the mail on sunday publishers would face a penalty of € 250,000 -lrb- $ 266,750 -rrb- if they repeated allegations of a split between schröder and wife doris schröder-kopf -lrb- photo -rrb- .
far from being the end of the affair , the newspaper responded to the german court action with a two-page barrage , taking the contest into a second round .
in an editorial with the title " sorry , herr schröder but you do n't rule britain ... at least , not yet , " the eurosceptic newspaper denounced the chancellor as a " vain politician " who " can not bear criticism . "
the mail added that the german chancellor 's actions were a warning to the british people that they stood to lose many of their liberties if their nation further integrates itself into the european union .
it also included a " message to our german readers , " written in german .
it said : " the mail on sunday will not be censored by federal chancellor schröder .
call the number below if you know any stories that mr. schröder would find embarrassing and that the german press ought to be publishing . "
the newspaper also commented on germany 's own censorship laws by adding : " because of our different tradition and our robust democracy , we can publish this sort of material and believe we have every right to do so .

schröder to take ' further steps ' says source speaking to the british daily the guardian , a source close to the chancellor said that further steps were likely , despite the view of british legal experts that the german court 's ruling was not enforceable in britain .
" i would reckon that there will be another round , " said the source .
" you have to accept that there is an urge to get to know politicians and that this can spill over from the public into the private sphere .

he is . "
in an official statement , the german government 's spokesman said : " we reject the allegation of censorship .
this was a sovereign and independent decision of the german courts .
the allegations will rebound on those who have made them . "
legal experts say germans must go to british court in order to stop the mail on sunday or any other british newspaper from going further , schröder would have to obtain an injunction in the english courts .
but the chances of this happening are slim because of the lack of privacy laws in britain .
geoffrey robertson , a leading british media lawyer told the guardian that the chancellor 's only choice would be to seek an injunction for libel or breach of confidence .
for that to be successful , he would have to swear on oath that the story was false .
if the mail on sunday defended the claim by proving the story was true , an injunction would not be granted .
" he could seek an injunction for breach of confidence , where he can pinpoint the source of the story as someone with whom he had a confidential relationship , such as a security guard , " said mr. robertson in the guardian .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany and france forge stronger bond from arch foes to friendly neighbors eu reform debate tops franco-german summit agenda savoir vivre on wheels germany , france to forge tighter ties current affairs -pipe- 20.01.2003 mutually beneficial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cars are hot items in france since france and germany embarked on friendly relations 40 years ago , bilateral trade between the neighbors has progressed with leaps and bounds .
now they are each others ' most important market . forty years ago , on january 22 , 1963 , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer signed the elysée treaty .
for decades before germany and france had been archenemies .
the franco-german friendship treaty was meant to change that through extensive cooperation on a political , economic and cultural basis .
the germans and french did n't just get to know each other better through educational exchanges or the joint television network arte .
the franco-german partnership also established the foundation for the political and economic union of europe .
the two countries are now each others ' most important trade and economic partner .
the statistics speak for themselves .
import and exports german cars are in high demand in france , while french cars lead german automotive imports .
last year 328,000 german cars were delivered to customers in france ; 254,000 french cars went to german customers .
cars are the leading item in bilateral trade , followed by machines , chemicals and pharmaceuticals , electrical products and foodstuffs .
on the french market german furniture is just as sought-after as washing machines .
in germany french wine and champagne have many adherents .
according to giselher schlebusch , spokesman for the franco-german chamber of commerce and industry in paris , absolutely everything is traded between the two countries – from raw products to high tech products .
give and take germany traditionally records a surplus in the bilateral trade balance : in 2001 it was up to € 20 billion -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- .
german exports to france were worth € 69 billion , while french exports to germany made up € 49 billion .
the bilateral balance increased only slightly last year due to economic problems in both countries .
while 16.8 percent of french imports come from germany , 14.6 percent of french exports go to germany .
the french portion of german export and imports is n't as high : france has an 11 percent share in german foreign trade .
thoroughly entrenched german-french market activities are promoted and supported by vast investments .
french investments in germany amount to € 30 billion .
german firms have invested around € 25 billion in subsidiaries in france .
the palette of subsidiaries ranges from sales offices and service points to large industrial facilities .
1400 german firms from all possible branches are members of the chamber of commerce in paris , and according to giselher schlebusch , the majority are subsidiaries that have been around for many years .
schlebusch believes that that fact alone is a sign of economic success , since the firms would have otherwise withdrawn from the market long ago .
though well-known companies are represented in the chamber , mainly small and medium-sized firms maintain distribution offices and production facilities in the neighboring country .

now they are each others ' most important market . forty years ago , on january 22 , 1963 , french president charles de gaulle and german chancellor konrad adenauer signed the elysée treaty .
for decades before germany and france had been archenemies .
the franco-german friendship treaty was meant to change that through extensive cooperation on a political , economic and cultural basis .
the germans and french did n't just get to know each other better through educational exchanges or the joint television network arte .
the franco-german partnership also established the foundation for the political and economic union of europe .
the two countries are now each others ' most important trade and economic partner .
the statistics speak for themselves .
import and exports german cars are in high demand in france , while french cars lead german automotive imports .
last year 328,000 german cars were delivered to customers in france ; 254,000 french cars went to german customers .
cars are the leading item in bilateral trade , followed by machines , chemicals and pharmaceuticals , electrical products and foodstuffs .
on the french market german furniture is just as sought-after as washing machines .
in germany french wine and champagne have many adherents .
according to giselher schlebusch , spokesman for the franco-german chamber of commerce and industry in paris , absolutely everything is traded between the two countries – from raw products to high tech products .
give and take germany traditionally records a surplus in the bilateral trade balance : in 2001 it was up to € 20 billion -lrb- $ 21.3 billion -rrb- .
german exports to france were worth € 69 billion , while french exports to germany made up € 49 billion .
the bilateral balance increased only slightly last year due to economic problems in both countries .
while 16.8 percent of french imports come from germany , 14.6 percent of french exports go to germany .
the french portion of german export and imports is n't as high : france has an 11 percent share in german foreign trade .
thoroughly entrenched german-french market activities are promoted and supported by vast investments .
french investments in germany amount to € 30 billion .
german firms have invested around € 25 billion in subsidiaries in france .
the palette of subsidiaries ranges from sales offices and service points to large industrial facilities .
1400 german firms from all possible branches are members of the chamber of commerce in paris , and according to giselher schlebusch , the majority are subsidiaries that have been around for many years .
schlebusch believes that that fact alone is a sign of economic success , since the firms would have otherwise withdrawn from the market long ago .
though well-known companies are represented in the chamber , mainly small and medium-sized firms maintain distribution offices and production facilities in the neighboring country .
each year around 100 german companies invest in the french market .
the german firm bosch , known for home appliances , tools and automotive equipment , has 15,000 employees in france ; siemens , the german engineering giant , has more than 10,000 workers there .
nearly every french car is constructed using parts made in germany .

the announcement reverses an earlier demand for just under £ 40 -lrb- $ 64 -rrb- per box from the liquidator who is winding up the company .
itv digital 's former owners carlton and granada , have stepped in to cover the cost of the boxes . "
the itv companies probably feared further negative publicity " hugh pym , bbc business correspondent bbc business correspondent hugh pym said : " itv digital 's customers continued to receive free-to-air services after the company collapsed last spring .
" but legally they did n't own the set-top boxes .
" so , when the accountancy firm grant thornton was appointed as liquidator to raise money for creditors , it asked the former subscribers to pay nearly £ 40 per box or to hand them back . "
negative publicity now , he revealed , carlton and granada had agreed to pay the liquidator nearly £ 3m for the boxes .
anyone who has already paid the £ 40 charge will be refunded .
hugh pym added : " the itv companies probably feared further negative publicity if the liquidator had to take legal action against customers to reclaim the boxes .
" they will also be keen to support viewers of digital television services , which include channels like itv 2 . "
itv digital collapsed after its parents , granada and carlton , spent more than £ 1bn trying build an alternative service to bskyb .
but it failed to match bskyb 's viewing figures , despite winning the expensive rights to broadcast football league matches .
it left behind debts of about £ 1.25bn and attempts by the league to recoup its losses from granada and carlton failed .

the ernst & young item club has suggested that " despite all the doom and gloom of the last few months , the uk economy is fundamentally sound " . "
the cost to household incomes and balance sheets has been enormous " peter spencer , item club economic adviser its latest report on the british economy concedes that uk consumers and businesses have paid a high price for stability , as purse strings have been significantly tightened in both households and company boardrooms .
but the group optimistically predicted that a pick-up in business spending could be closer than previously thought .
paying the price peter spencer , the item club 's economic adviser , said the slump in company share values and budgets has corrected " the euphoria " that led to the inflated valuations and spending plans in the run up to the millennium . "

" this ' adjustment ' leaves the economy in much better shape in the long term , " said mr spencer .
however , he added : " the cost to household incomes and balance sheets has been enormous . "
reality checks the item club 's report admitted that the recent black mood about the economy had been fuelled by concerns over slowing consumer spending , falling house prices , a weak business sector and , not least , a possible war with iraq .
but the group welcomed such a ' reality check ' and said it would not lead to the crash some feared .
" in our view this is a healthy development , a sign the high street and the housing market are at last succumbing to the force of gravity . "
the item club predicts that the spending boom and runaway house prices that have fuelled recent economic growth will gradually make way for export and investment sectors to take up the running and accelerate economic growth into 2004 .
neighbourly concerns the biggest threats to the uk come from abroad , according to the item club , which pointed to weak trade figures from the us and germany in particular .
a war with iraq would also exacerbate the threat and any british involvement would be expensive . "
there are very few of us that enter the new year in better financial shape than last year " item club however , the report remains unfalteringly optimistic , arguing that the recent falls in the dollar are simply bringing it back to a more a realistic level - " at last " .

safety net the item club , made up of uk or global organisations and sponsored by ernst & young , acknowledges that " there are very few of us that enter the new year in better financial shape than last year " .
many young people are realising they will struggle to afford their first home , while their parents are struggling to create a comfortable retirement .
nonetheless , the report suggests adjustments to the economy will have ironed themselves out by the end of next year and should ensure that the uk economy is on a more even keel by 2005 .
the group is also more confident of a turnaround in corporate fortunes .
" this could mean the green shoots of a revival in business spending will be closer than previously thought .
" exports from the uk and business investment into the country are poised to at least begin to pick up in 2003 . "
