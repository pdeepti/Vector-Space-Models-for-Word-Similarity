science is not about intuition - it 's about evidence .
the researchers now need to provide some brian johnson , english nature the scientists are from the broom 's barn research station in suffolk and its parent body rothamsted research , an agricultural research institute supported by the uk 's biotechnology and biological sciences research council -lrb- bbsrc -rrb- .
their work is reported in proceedings b , published by the royal society , the uk 's national academy of sciences .
the research concentrated on genetically modified herbicide-tolerant -lrb- gmht -rrb- sugar beet , a " row crop " -lrb- one grown in rows -rrb- .
insect census the team developed a simple technique to control weeds within the rows of beet , with those between the rows controlled by later spraying over the entire plot .
one series of experiments investigated the effect of weed management strategies on yields of gm beet modified to tolerate glyphosate herbicide made by monsanto .
gm crops still arouse deep worries these plots were compared both with untreated control plots and with others treated with a variety of conventional herbicides .
a second series of experiments allowed the researchers to evaluate the number of insects found under each weed control scheme .
they say : " weed control from the early overall glyphosate programmes was generally better than that from the conventional treatments .
" weed biomass was greater than conventional following the later overall sprays of glyphosate ...
yield reductions in the untreated plots compared to those treated with conventional herbicides ranged from 24 to 88 % .
" glyphosate gave the best yields in each trial - on average 9.7 % greater than the conventional treatments . "
to gauge the environmental impact of the different treatments , the scientists rated the experimental plots on the millieumeetlat scoring system , which evaluates toxicity , mobility and persistence of pesticides .
they report : " scores for the conventional herbicides ranged from 32 to 218 for water organisms , 11 to 960 for soil organisms , and 155 to 16,540 for deeper water .
' double benefit ' " the equivalent scores for glyphosate treatments were 0 , 5-6 and 0 respectively ...
a score greater than 100 is considered unacceptable for an individual application in the millieumeetlat system . "
with insects , fewest beetles were found in plots treated with conventional herbicides or early overall glyphosate applications , and most where weed control was delayed .
skylarks are a declining farmland species the researchers say their work shows farmers could use gmht crops to achieve weed-free fields for birds like the stone curlew , or to provide low-growing vegetation for skylarks .
they say controlling weeds in this way can help to minimise the use of insecticides as well as herbicides , by giving insects another refuge apart from the crop .
but brian johnson , gm expert at english nature , which advises the uk government , is sceptical about their findings .
creating dependence he told bbc news online : " there 's nothing new in this , and no real evidence of any environmental benefit .
" you may get more weeds and more insects , but there 's nothing to show that will help birds , and it could in fact harm them .
" farmland birds ' first broods each year often fail from lack of food , and it 's the second broods that are more important .
" they 're the ones that could be affected by this system - you 'd hit the crop with glyphosate just when the birds were in there with their hatchlings .
" science is not about intuition - it 's about evidence .

however , the figures show that councils failed to collect £ 133m of the £ 1.42bn due last year .
the statistics show they recovered more than 90 % of the total tax due .
although this was a record figure , the commission said there was still room for improvement .
there is no excuse for councils who continue to underperform tricia marwick msp only aberdeen city and dundee city councils failed to improve on the previous year .
however , despite better collection the rate in glasgow was just above 81 % .
alastair macnish , chairman of the accounts commission , warned against complacency but said there had been a marked improvement .
some councils needed to " learn lessons " and perform more effectively , he added .
statistics show that collection levels fluctuated across the country .
97.3 % in orkney 95 % in stirling 93.2 % in south lanarkshire 88.9 % in eilean siar -lrb- western isles -rrb- 86.4 % in east ayrshire 81.5 % in glasgow .
mr macnish said : " councils must keep trying to make it easier for people to pay their bills or receive their benefits promptly .
" councils rely on people paying their council tax but last year £ 133m was not paid on time .
" the longer it remains outstanding the harder councils have to work to collect it . "
glasgow council spokesman john brown said the authority continues to pursue outstanding bills and its income was higher than in the accounts commission figures .
he said : " after the year has ended we continually work to collect the remainder of that council tax and since that year has ended we 've collected another £ 17m of last year 's council tax .
" our collection rate is nearer 94 % which is only 2 % short of the national average . "
the scottish national party said those councils which consistently underperformed should be " named and shamed " .
' across the board ' tricia marwick msp said : " there is no excuse for councils who continue to underperform .
" they should be setting an example to their local communities and businesses instead of breaking the rules themselves . "
the public should be informed of poor financial management , she added .
" scotland needs to move forward and not stand still and the best way to do this is improve standards across the board . "
tory local government spokesman keith harding said the £ 133m shortfall would ultimately fall on " honest , hard-working scots " .

the authorities will find out on wednesday whether their application to knock down c hall at perth prison has been successful .
historic scotland said the hall , which dates from the 19th century , is architecturally important and should be preserved .
perth and kinross development control committee will decide the hall 's fate .
clive fairweather : restructuring " long overdue " c hall is part of the original perth prison built to house thousands of french prisoners from the napoleonic war .
it is recognised as one of the most outdated in scotland and one of the few blocks left in the country where the practice of " slopping out " still takes place .
but the proposal to tear down the a-listed building and replace it with a modern facility has brought strong objections .
historic scotland said it was not convinced the case for demolition was justified and the architectural heritage society of scotland branded the plans " preposterous " .
' needs must ' the scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- however , described the hall as the worst in the jail and said it should be replaced .
a spokesman said : " it is widely recognised that the practice of slopping out is unacceptable and this demolition is really a case of ' needs must ' .
" c hall is a listed building .
however , we are confident that our reasons for its demolition and rebuilding are sound and it is up to the local authority now . "
prison inspectors last may praised improved conditions at the prison which , they said , had " suffered many years of neglect " .
a report by clive fairweather , the then hm chief inspector of prisons , praised investment at the jail .
there was unrest at the jail last year but he criticised the conditions experienced by short-term prisoners housed in c hall .
the report said conditions in the block were " unacceptable " .
mr fairweather said at the time : " its old gallery structure , and in-cell electrical power , indicate that fundamental restructuring is long overdue . "
an sps investigation was launched last june after a disturbance at the prison that month involving about 40 prisoners .

the authorities will find out on wednesday whether their application to knock down c hall at perth prison has been successful .
historic scotland said the hall , which dates from the 19th century , is architecturally important and should be preserved .
perth and kinross development control committee will decide the hall 's fate .
c hall is part of the original perth prison built to house thousands of french prisoners from the napoleonic war .
it is recognised as one of the most outdated in scotland and one of the few blocks left in the country where the practice of " slopping out " still takes place .
but the proposal to tear down the a-listed building and replace it with a modern facility has brought strong objections .
historic scotland said it was not convinced the case for demolition was justified and the architectural heritage society of scotland branded the plans " preposterous " .
' needs must ' the scottish prison service -lrb- sps -rrb- however , described the hall as the worst in the jail and said it should be replaced .
a spokesman said : " it is widely recognised that the practice of slopping out is unacceptable and this demolition is really a case of ' needs must ' .
" c hall is a listed building .
however , we are confident that our reasons for its demolition and rebuilding are sound and it is up to the local authority now . "
prison inspectors last may praised improved conditions at the prison which , they said , had " suffered many years of neglect " .
a report by clive fairweather , the then hm chief inspector of prisons , praised investment at the jail .
but he criticised the conditions experienced by short-term prisoners housed in c hall .
the report said conditions in the block were " unacceptable " .
mr fairweather said at the time : " its old gallery structure , and in-cell electrical power , indicate that fundamental restructuring is long overdue . "
an sps investigation was launched last june after a disturbance at the prison that month involving about 40 prisoners .
the fire brigade was called to deal with a fire which was thought to have started during the unrest .
the inmates had refused to return to their cells in the c hall block , but the situation was brought under control an hour later .

devon and cornwall police says the airwave system , which had been due online this year , has been put back until 2005 .
police say they are blaming delays in getting planning permissions for the system , which is also known as tetra .
in many places where masts have been planned , people worried about the health implications have organised protest campaigns .
villagers from lustleigh on dartmoor persuaded the national park authority to abandon plans for a mast in the village in september 2002 .
they claim the system is a health risk .
lustleigh anti-mast campaigner dr graham blackwell said : " there will be a lot of people across the westcountry who will be relieved at this step forward in the health implications of the masts .
" there are various scientific papers showing the implications of the sort of radiation that tetra emits and what they can do in various different ways . "
planning delays however , the police say this is only a pause and that the system will go ahead .
superintendent tim swarbrick said : " the delays in the planning process have been prompted by a number of people who have expressed concerns .
" people should be able to say what they think and ask questions .
but i would urge that people have an open mind and read all the research .
" at this stage , airwave has proved to be entirely safe . "

iceland boasts 90 % of the global population of the bird and the majority of them spend winter in scotland .
but the rspb has warned that the icelandic government 's project could destroy the bird 's breeding grounds .
both schemes would provide power for north american-owned aluminium smelting plants based in iceland .
if these projects go ahead it will be a loss not only to iceland but also to the world jóhann óli hilmarsson ispb the rspb has urged the government not to press ahead with the hydro-electric construction .
work is under way on the karahnjukar hydro-electric scheme , in iceland 's central highlands .
the rspb claimed the project would damage the breeding , feeding and moulting areas for 3,800 pairs of pink-footed geese .
duncan orr-ewing , of rspb scotland , said one in seven geese could be at risk .
' globally recognised ' he said : " the two sites are globally recognised for their importance for birds and other wildlife .
" but iceland seems determined to renege on its international conservation commitments and damage and destroy substantial portions of these sites . "
according to the rspb , the scheme would flood up to 56 square kilometres of arctic wilderness .
it claimed the project was initially rejected by the icelandic planning agency , but that decision was reversed by iceland 's environment minister siv fridleifsdottir .
the rspb also said that a second proposed dam at thjorsarver would destroy habitat used by an estimated 500 to 800 pairs of pink-footed geese .
' campaigned vigorously ' jóhann óli hilmarsson , of the icelandic society for the protection of birds -lrb- ispb -rrb- , said that if the projects went ahead it would have grave ramifications .
he said : " our society has campaigned vigorously to persuade the icelandic government to refuse permission for these dams to be built and is asking for our government to protect the karahnjukar and thjorsarver areas for future generations .
" if these projects go ahead it will be a loss not only to iceland but also to the world . "
rspb scotland said its loch of strathbeg reserve welcomed as many as 50,000 pink-footed geese during the winter , and 11,500 passed through vane farm in perth and kinross last november .

bbc security correspondent frank gardner analyses the threat to the uk from a militant network with its roots in algeria .
the police in manchester were acting on a tip-off .
where did they get their information from ?
police have been acting on leads that had been generated in some cases by mi5 , in some cases by the fbi , the cia , by the french security service the dst and indeed by the algerians and other arab governments .
this was part of a big international operation to try to crack this north african militant network in europe that is believed to be sympathetic to al-qaeda .
how do these terror cells show support for al-qaeda ?
it is important to distinguish between logistics operations by al-qaeda sympathisers - people who are providing stolen credit cards , false passports , money , safe houses , a bit of indoctrination - and the actual active terror cells .
what we saw in wood green , in terms of the ricin , looked like an active operation - that is what has really rattled people .
that investigation was like a domino effect - it sparked a lot of other investigations .
leads from that have led to bournemouth , have led to manchester , and i am sure we are going to see raids all over britain in other cities over the next few weeks and months .
why are algerian or north african terror suspects living in the uk in the first place ?
it is a political hot potato , this .
a lot of them have come in as asylum seekers - they have infiltrated into the legitimate muslim population and hidden themselves amongst ordinary asylum seekers .
some of these people have become extremely dangerous because they have been subsumed into al-qaeda 's psyche the reason why a lot of algerians are here in the first place , why there is a network , is that in 1995 the french anti-terrorist people really cracked down , after a number of bombings in the metro that were carried out by algerians that killed eight people and injured well over 100 .
quite a few algerian extremists sought refuge in the uk .
britain let them stay here because the authorities did n't see them as a threat to the country , nor did they appear to be breaking any laws .
so they left them alone , and basically ignored them for the first year or two .
the authorities then woke up to the problem , because the french kept insisting these were dangerous people , and started monitoring them .
but they do not have enough resources - they did not then and do not now - to monitor all of them .
why have they suddenly become a threat to the uk ?
in the last two years , some of these people have become extremely dangerous because they have basically been subsumed into al-qaeda 's whole psyche , its whole mindset .
in other words , they have forgotten about their own struggle in algeria .
but we should not penalise all algerians or north africans for this .

the uk foreign office issued the warning after receiving information that terrorists were planning an attack . "
british nationals in tanzania , and especially in zanzibar , should be vigilant " foreign office tourists staying on the island of zanzibar , off the east african coast , were warned to take particular care in public places .
western interests in africa have been the target of such attacks in the past .
eight people were killed when terrorists attacked the us embassy in dar es salaam in august 1998 .
in neighbouring kenya , 15 people died in a bomb attack on a hotel near mombasa on 28 november last year .
' be vigilant ' an unsuccessful attempt was also made to shoot down an israeli charter plane on the same day .
the updated foreign office advice says : " we believe that tanzania , including zanzibar and pemba islands , is one of a number of countries in east africa and the horn of africa where there may be an increased terrorist threat .
" we have received information that an international terrorist group may be planning an attack on the island of zanzibar .
" british nationals in tanzania , and especially in zanzibar , should be vigilant , particularly in public places frequented by foreigners such as hotels , restaurants , shopping malls , markets , bars and nightclubs . "

a verdict is not expected for a few more days .
the charge of subversion can carry the death penalty , though analysts believe the men are more likely to receive prison sentences , given china 's concern about its international image .
the trial is being closely watched by foreign human rights and labour groups .
the protests the men were accused of orchestrating were among the biggest of their kind seen in china .
crowds of up to 30,000 people gathered to denounce corrupt local politicians and to demand more help for workers laid off from their jobs .
rights concerns the head of the new york-based china labour watch , li qiang , said the trial had ended after a few hours .
he said he had spoken to a relative of one of the defendants , who had attended the trial .
china could face increased unrest " the prosecutors accused the men of participating in the china democracy party , " said mr li , referring to a party banned by china , which has seen many of its members jailed .
the rights group amnesty international said there were " serious concerns " over whether yao fuxin , 57 , and xiao yunliang , would receive a fair trial .
" if they are convicted of subversion after doing nothing more than peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression , association or assembly , we would consider them to be prisoners of conscience , " it said in a statement .
large-scale demonstrations are still unusual in china , but correspondents say the country 's crumbling state-owned enterprises and spiralling unemployment could spark increased unrest .
most of those who took part in last year 's protests in liaoyang worked for the city 's ferro-alloy factory , a bankrupt , state-owned enterprise .
when the factory closed , employees were promised pensions and back wages .
but they never materialised and many of the unemployed workers suspected the factory 's managers of embezzlement .

during his first day of evidence on tuesday , the former tory leader rejected suggestions the british government planned the events of bloody sunday as " absurd " .
the appearance of the 86-year-old was postponed last month when he fell a few days before he was due to testify . "
it is therefore absurd to suggest that her majesty 's government intended or was prepared to risk the events which occurred " sir edward heath the tribunal is investigating what happened on 30 january 1972 when paratroops opened fire on civilians at a civil rights march in the bogside in londonderry killing 13 people .
another man died later .
sir edward rejected the suggestion the killings were part of a high-level conspiracy .
he also denied pressuring lord widgery - who headed the first inquiry - into producing a report that was favourable to the security forces and said the conclusions reached were achieved " without fear and favour " .
" the tragic deaths in londonderry on 30 january 1972 , outraged the catholic community , increased support for the ira and destroyed the prospect of a political initiative , " he said in his inquiry statement .
" it is therefore absurd to suggest that her majesty 's government intended or was prepared to risk the events which occurred . "
he added : " the general view of her majesty 's government was that the ' no-go ' areas would have , in due course , to be retrieved , but there was no plan as at the end of january 1972 for that to happen .
" the operation was seen as very much one of containment , with no intention of actively seeking to use this march as an opportunity to retrieve any part of the ' no-go ' areas . "
confidential papers released two weeks ago under the 30 year rule revealed the former prime minister was warned days before the bloody sunday march that soldiers being sent to the city had already " over-reacted " at civil rights protests .
according to the papers , his most senior official asked him whether or not he was prepared for the consequences of action by the military against protesters in northern ireland .
four days before the march , sir edward received a security briefing on the march , organised to protest against internment - a form of imprisonment without trial introduced at the height of the political and civil crisis .
' over-reacted ' in his memo to the prime minister , cabinet secretary sir burke trend , the most senior civil servant , recommended mr heath review the activities of the parachute regiment which was being moved to derry as part of the operation .
" you may wish to question the secretary of state for defence about recent suggestions in the press and on television that the army over-reacted against some of the civil rights demonstrations last weekend , " wrote sir burke .
" and that , in particular , soldiers of the parachute regiment , by being unnecessarily rough , have gratuitously provoked resentment among peaceful elements of the roman catholic population . "
later , sir edward was said to have told the judge investigating the killings that he should not forget the uk was fighting a " propaganda war " .
much of this material has already been given in statements to the bloody sunday inquiry .
the saville inquiry was set up by prime minister tony blair to reinvestigate the evidence because the relatives felt the first inquiry was a whitewash .
lord saville and the commonwealth judges who comprise the inquiry , are not expected to report back until 2004 .
the inquiry , which usually sits at the guildhall in derry , is currently hearing the evidence from military witnesses in london because of concerns for their safety .
