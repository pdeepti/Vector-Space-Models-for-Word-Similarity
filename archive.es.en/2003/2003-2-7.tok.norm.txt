bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

inside , a firework of colours explodes on the screen , and viewers snuggle deeper into their red , plush seats at the berlinale palace film theatre .
it is the first day of berlin 's 53rd international film festival , and what better film to start the show with than " chicago , " rob marshall 's magnificent musical firework ? and magnificent it was .
with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .
indeed it warmed the hearts of thursday 's first audience so , that they even applauded and cheered marshall 's masterpiece when it was over .
as one spectator from a hollywood magazine said , obviously moved after the showing , he had been to berlinale for five years , but " had not experienced such response before . " grand hyatt hotel , 3.15 p.m. : hundreds of journalists struggle to get into a room which is already bursting with members of the press .
cameramen fight for the best places in front of a long , white table , on which name tags are taped : " rob marshall , director " , " catherine zeta-jones , actress " , " richard gere , actor " and " renée zellweger , actress " .
a melange of languages from all over the world mingle to form a constant buzz , which only subsides when a severe-looking bodyguard walks across the stage . a long wait later , someone starts clapping to one side of the stage .
a jet-haired , queenly looking catherine zeta-jones steps on the stage , followed by a comparatively small , lithe and blond-haired zellweger , both dressed in black .
richard gere , in grey flannel suit and spectacles , follows , with quick , light steps .
the cameramen are ordered by a bodyguard to sit down .
there is a short confusion as to who sits where , then finally , the conference begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what follows is a mixture of ongoing praise from the cast for their director , and a show of joviality from the side of the actors .
the stars are in a good mood . rob marshall is requested to give a " marshall plan " for upcoming directors who aim to film a musical , gere is asked by a serious looking german journalist to link the film to the motto of this year 's festival " towards tolerance " -lrb- which he refuses to do -rrb- , and zellweger loses herself in a gush of emotion over the " truly extraordinary " experience .
gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .
gere , suddenly wide awake grins and mouths into the microphone : " are there any women actually having orgasms now ? " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4p.m.
the organizer , rather like a pub owner calling for " last orders " , announces the last questions .
questioned on any possible rivalry between the two actresses in real life -lrb- they are rivals in the film -rrb- , catherine zeta jones flashes a smile and counters with a request that every woman in the room should kiss their next female neighbour .
a male voice shouts from somewhere in the throng : " are the men allowed to kiss the girls too ? " .

inside , a firework of colours explodes on the screen , and viewers snuggle deeper into their red , plush seats at the berlinale palace film theatre .
it is the first day of berlin 's 53rd international film festival , and what better film to start the show with than " chicago , " rob marshall 's magnificent musical firework ? and magnificent it was .
with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .
indeed it warmed the hearts of thursday 's first audience so , that they even applauded and cheered marshall 's masterpiece when it was over .
as one spectator from a hollywood magazine said , obviously moved after the showing , he had been to berlinale for five years , but " had not experienced such response before . " grand hyatt hotel , 3.15 p.m. : hundreds of journalists struggle to get into a room which is already bursting with members of the press .
cameramen fight for the best places in front of a long , white table , on which name tags are taped : " rob marshall , director " , " catherine zeta-jones , actress " , " richard gere , actor " and " renée zellweger , actress " .
a melange of languages from all over the world mingle to form a constant buzz , which only subsides when a severe-looking bodyguard walks across the stage . a long wait later , someone starts clapping to one side of the stage .
a jet-haired , queenly looking catherine zeta-jones steps on the stage , followed by a comparatively small , lithe and blond-haired zellweger , both dressed in black .
richard gere , in grey flannel suit and spectacles , follows , with quick , light steps .
the cameramen are ordered by a bodyguard to sit down .
there is a short confusion as to who sits where , then finally , the conference begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what follows is a mixture of ongoing praise from the cast for their director , and a show of joviality from the side of the actors .
the stars are in a good mood . rob marshall is requested to give a " marshall plan " for upcoming directors who aim to film a musical , gere is asked by a serious looking german journalist to link the film to the motto of this year 's festival " towards tolerance " -lrb- which he refuses to do -rrb- , and zellweger loses herself in a gush of emotion over the " truly extraordinary " experience .
gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .
gere , suddenly wide awake grins and mouths into the microphone : " are there any women actually having orgasms now ? " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4p.m.
the organizer , rather like a pub owner calling for " last orders " , announces the last questions .
questioned on any possible rivalry between the two actresses in real life -lrb- they are rivals in the film -rrb- , catherine zeta jones flashes a smile and counters with a request that every woman in the room should kiss their next female neighbour .
a male voice shouts from somewhere in the throng : " are the men allowed to kiss the girls too ? " .
everyone laughs . outside , a straggle of fans mill in the cold around the hotel 's back entrance .
a sleek , black mercedes shoots out of the garage 's gaping entrance and noses its way through the crowds .
a small group of young girls start to shout , it is richard gere inside the car , waving majestically from its dark inside .
passersby stop and turn their heads , but quickly move on , hurrying in the cold , seemingly unperturbed .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .
in an interview earlier this week , schröder said he would consider loosening legal protections preventing layoffs , but only if employers could deliver a reasonable number of new jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its alliance for jobs initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions .

the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .
in an interview earlier this week , schröder said he would consider loosening legal protections preventing layoffs , but only if employers could deliver a reasonable number of new jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its alliance for jobs initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .
and lucy liu 's -lrb- photo -rrb- appearance in thursday 's screening of " chicago " certainly made more hearts flutter than chan 's on friday . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "

before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .

nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .

but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .
in a radio interview , andre flahaut said a decision made now would be " premature and dangerous . "

"
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .
and lucy liu 's -lrb- photo -rrb- appearance in thursday 's screening of " chicago " certainly made more hearts flutter than chan 's on friday . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .
in an interview earlier this week , schröder said he would consider loosening legal protections preventing layoffs , but only if employers could deliver a reasonable number of new jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its alliance for jobs initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .

inside , a firework of colours explodes on the screen , and viewers snuggle deeper into their red , plush seats at the berlinale palace film theatre .
it is the first day of berlin 's 53rd international film festival , and what better film to start the show with than " chicago , " rob marshall 's magnificent musical firework ? and magnificent it was .
with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .
indeed it warmed the hearts of thursday 's first audience so , that they even applauded and cheered marshall 's masterpiece when it was over .
as one spectator from a hollywood magazine said , obviously moved after the showing , he had been to berlinale for five years , but " had not experienced such response before . " grand hyatt hotel , 3.15 p.m. : hundreds of journalists struggle to get into a room which is already bursting with members of the press .
cameramen fight for the best places in front of a long , white table , on which name tags are taped : " rob marshall , director " , " catherine zeta-jones , actress " , " richard gere , actor " and " renée zellweger , actress " .
a melange of languages from all over the world mingle to form a constant buzz , which only subsides when a severe-looking bodyguard walks across the stage . a long wait later , someone starts clapping to one side of the stage .
a jet-haired , queenly looking catherine zeta-jones steps on the stage , followed by a comparatively small , lithe and blond-haired zellweger , both dressed in black .
richard gere , in grey flannel suit and spectacles , follows , with quick , light steps .
the cameramen are ordered by a bodyguard to sit down .
there is a short confusion as to who sits where , then finally , the conference begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what follows is a mixture of ongoing praise from the cast for their director , and a show of joviality from the side of the actors .
the stars are in a good mood . rob marshall is requested to give a " marshall plan " for upcoming directors who aim to film a musical , gere is asked by a serious looking german journalist to link the film to the motto of this year 's festival " towards tolerance " -lrb- which he refuses to do -rrb- , and zellweger loses herself in a gush of emotion over the " truly extraordinary " experience .
gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .
gere , suddenly wide awake grins and mouths into the microphone : " are there any women actually having orgasms now ? " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4p.m.
the organizer , rather like a pub owner calling for " last orders " , announces the last questions .
questioned on any possible rivalry between the two actresses in real life -lrb- they are rivals in the film -rrb- , catherine zeta jones flashes a smile and counters with a request that every woman in the room should kiss their next female neighbour .
a male voice shouts from somewhere in the throng : " are the men allowed to kiss the girls too ? " .
everyone laughs . outside , a straggle of fans mill in the cold around the hotel 's back entrance .
a sleek , black mercedes shoots out of the garage 's gaping entrance and noses its way through the crowds .
a small group of young girls start to shout , it is richard gere inside the car , waving majestically from its dark inside .
passersby stop and turn their heads , but quickly move on , hurrying in the cold , seemingly unperturbed .
after all , for berliners , it is only berlinale . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .
there is a sense of optimism , and pride in his voice . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the erich kästner museum in dresden 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .

indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .

nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .
but if one nation objects , the plan could be scuttled because the north atlantic treaty organization works on a principle of unanimity .

" where there has been a disagreement it is over when to formally task this military planning .

but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .
in an interview earlier this week , schröder said he would consider loosening legal protections preventing layoffs , but only if employers could deliver a reasonable number of new jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its alliance for jobs initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions .

in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .
there is a sense of optimism , and pride in his voice . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the erich kästner museum in dresden 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

inside , a firework of colours explodes on the screen , and viewers snuggle deeper into their red , plush seats at the berlinale palace film theatre .
it is the first day of berlin 's 53rd international film festival , and what better film to start the show with than " chicago , " rob marshall 's magnificent musical firework ? and magnificent it was .
with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .
indeed it warmed the hearts of thursday 's first audience so , that they even applauded and cheered marshall 's masterpiece when it was over .
as one spectator from a hollywood magazine said , obviously moved after the showing , he had been to berlinale for five years , but " had not experienced such response before . " grand hyatt hotel , 3.15 p.m. : hundreds of journalists struggle to get into a room which is already bursting with members of the press .
cameramen fight for the best places in front of a long , white table , on which name tags are taped : " rob marshall , director " , " catherine zeta-jones , actress " , " richard gere , actor " and " renée zellweger , actress " .
a melange of languages from all over the world mingle to form a constant buzz , which only subsides when a severe-looking bodyguard walks across the stage . a long wait later , someone starts clapping to one side of the stage .
a jet-haired , queenly looking catherine zeta-jones steps on the stage , followed by a comparatively small , lithe and blond-haired zellweger , both dressed in black .
richard gere , in grey flannel suit and spectacles , follows , with quick , light steps .
the cameramen are ordered by a bodyguard to sit down .
there is a short confusion as to who sits where , then finally , the conference begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what follows is a mixture of ongoing praise from the cast for their director , and a show of joviality from the side of the actors .
the stars are in a good mood . rob marshall is requested to give a " marshall plan " for upcoming directors who aim to film a musical , gere is asked by a serious looking german journalist to link the film to the motto of this year 's festival " towards tolerance " -lrb- which he refuses to do -rrb- , and zellweger loses herself in a gush of emotion over the " truly extraordinary " experience .
gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .
gere , suddenly wide awake grins and mouths into the microphone : " are there any women actually having orgasms now ? " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4p.m.
the organizer , rather like a pub owner calling for " last orders " , announces the last questions .
questioned on any possible rivalry between the two actresses in real life -lrb- they are rivals in the film -rrb- , catherine zeta jones flashes a smile and counters with a request that every woman in the room should kiss their next female neighbour .
a male voice shouts from somewhere in the throng : " are the men allowed to kiss the girls too ? " .
everyone laughs . outside , a straggle of fans mill in the cold around the hotel 's back entrance .
a sleek , black mercedes shoots out of the garage 's gaping entrance and noses its way through the crowds .
a small group of young girls start to shout , it is richard gere inside the car , waving majestically from its dark inside .
passersby stop and turn their heads , but quickly move on , hurrying in the cold , seemingly unperturbed .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .
but if one nation objects , the plan could be scuttled because the north atlantic treaty organization works on a principle of unanimity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson in a statement , robertson acknowledged that there was a disagreement on the issue among alliance members .
" where there has been a disagreement it is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan , " he said .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive two forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance and patriot air-defense missiles .
three countries raise objections opposition has arisen from germany , belgium and france .
the issue is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .
in a radio interview , andre flahaut said a decision made now would be " premature and dangerous . "
in response to this opposition , roberston has pointed out to his allies that they pledged during their november summit to actively support the u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
turkey announces support in turkey , the country 's leader staked out his position on a potential war on thursday .
prime minister abdullah gül said turkey would not join a war but said his government was prepared to support those who did .
as a first step , the parliament decided on thursday to allow the u.s. military to expand its bases in turkey .
in about two weeks , the assembly also will take up a plan to allow the united states to send more troops into the country .
the united states also gained pledges of support from 10 countries in eastern europe on wednesday .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.02.2003 nato waits on plan to assist turkey in case of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping watch : a surveillance plane like the ones being sought to assist turkey .
nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .
but if one nation objects , the plan could be scuttled because the north atlantic treaty organization works on a principle of unanimity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson in a statement , robertson acknowledged that there was a disagreement on the issue among alliance members .
" where there has been a disagreement it is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan , " he said .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive two forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance and patriot air-defense missiles .
three countries raise objections opposition has arisen from germany , belgium and france .
the issue is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .
in a radio interview , andre flahaut said a decision made now would be " premature and dangerous . "
in response to this opposition , roberston has pointed out to his allies that they pledged during their november summit to actively support the u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
turkey announces support in turkey , the country 's leader staked out his position on a potential war on thursday .
prime minister abdullah gül said turkey would not join a war but said his government was prepared to support those who did .
as a first step , the parliament decided on thursday to allow the u.s. military to expand its bases in turkey .
in about two weeks , the assembly also will take up a plan to allow the united states to send more troops into the country .
the united states also gained pledges of support from 10 countries in eastern europe on wednesday .
the pledge followed a similar pledge for eight other european leaders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " new europe " central europeans reject the concept of a " new " europe says a czech political commentator .
hungary , poland and the czech republic support the u.s. position towards iraq out of gratitude for help in ending the cold war .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .
but if one nation objects , the plan could be scuttled because the north atlantic treaty organization works on a principle of unanimity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson in a statement , robertson acknowledged that there was a disagreement on the issue among alliance members .
" where there has been a disagreement it is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan , " he said .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive two forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance and patriot air-defense missiles .
three countries raise objections opposition has arisen from germany , belgium and france .
the issue is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .
in a radio interview , andre flahaut said a decision made now would be " premature and dangerous . "
in response to this opposition , roberston has pointed out to his allies that they pledged during their november summit to actively support the u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
turkey announces support in turkey , the country 's leader staked out his position on a potential war on thursday .
prime minister abdullah gül said turkey would not join a war but said his government was prepared to support those who did .
as a first step , the parliament decided on thursday to allow the u.s. military to expand its bases in turkey .
in about two weeks , the assembly also will take up a plan to allow the united states to send more troops into the country .
the united states also gained pledges of support from 10 countries in eastern europe on wednesday .
the pledge followed a similar pledge for eight other european leaders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " new europe " central europeans reject the concept of a " new " europe says a czech political commentator .
hungary , poland and the czech republic support the u.s. position towards iraq out of gratitude for help in ending the cold war .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .

" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "

" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .

" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .

the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .

he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .

he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .

but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .
but if one nation objects , the plan could be scuttled because the north atlantic treaty organization works on a principle of unanimity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson in a statement , robertson acknowledged that there was a disagreement on the issue among alliance members .
" where there has been a disagreement it is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan , " he said .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive two forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance and patriot air-defense missiles .
three countries raise objections opposition has arisen from germany , belgium and france .
the issue is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .
in a radio interview , andre flahaut said a decision made now would be " premature and dangerous . "
in response to this opposition , roberston has pointed out to his allies that they pledged during their november summit to actively support the u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
turkey announces support in turkey , the country 's leader staked out his position on a potential war on thursday .
prime minister abdullah gül said turkey would not join a war but said his government was prepared to support those who did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : glitz and glamour at berlinale " shoot films , not people " berlinale log : wladimir kaminer on the state of foreign film strong german cast for berlin film festival berlinale log : more stars , less show culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.02.2003 berlinale log : festival gets into gere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosive start to the berlinale : rob marshall 's musical firework , chicago richard gere plays the gentleman , catherine zeta-jones the queen bee and renée zellweger the tearful young actress at the first showing at this year 's berlin international film festival . berlinale palace cinema , 1 p.m. : outside , snow flakes drift slowly across potsdamer platz and an icy wind makes passers-by snuggle deeper into their winter coats .
inside , a firework of colours explodes on the screen , and viewers snuggle deeper into their red , plush seats at the berlinale palace film theatre .
it is the first day of berlin 's 53rd international film festival , and what better film to start the show with than " chicago , " rob marshall 's magnificent musical firework ? and magnificent it was .
with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .
indeed it warmed the hearts of thursday 's first audience so , that they even applauded and cheered marshall 's masterpiece when it was over .
as one spectator from a hollywood magazine said , obviously moved after the showing , he had been to berlinale for five years , but " had not experienced such response before . " grand hyatt hotel , 3.15 p.m. : hundreds of journalists struggle to get into a room which is already bursting with members of the press .
cameramen fight for the best places in front of a long , white table , on which name tags are taped : " rob marshall , director " , " catherine zeta-jones , actress " , " richard gere , actor " and " renée zellweger , actress " .
a melange of languages from all over the world mingle to form a constant buzz , which only subsides when a severe-looking bodyguard walks across the stage . a long wait later , someone starts clapping to one side of the stage .
a jet-haired , queenly looking catherine zeta-jones steps on the stage , followed by a comparatively small , lithe and blond-haired zellweger , both dressed in black .
richard gere , in grey flannel suit and spectacles , follows , with quick , light steps .
the cameramen are ordered by a bodyguard to sit down .
there is a short confusion as to who sits where , then finally , the conference begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what follows is a mixture of ongoing praise from the cast for their director , and a show of joviality from the side of the actors .
the stars are in a good mood . rob marshall is requested to give a " marshall plan " for upcoming directors who aim to film a musical , gere is asked by a serious looking german journalist to link the film to the motto of this year 's festival " towards tolerance " -lrb- which he refuses to do -rrb- , and zellweger loses herself in a gush of emotion over the " truly extraordinary " experience .
gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .
gere , suddenly wide awake grins and mouths into the microphone : " are there any women actually having orgasms now ? " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4p.m.
the organizer , rather like a pub owner calling for " last orders " , announces the last questions .
questioned on any possible rivalry between the two actresses in real life -lrb- they are rivals in the film -rrb- , catherine zeta jones flashes a smile and counters with a request that every woman in the room should kiss their next female neighbour .
a male voice shouts from somewhere in the throng : " are the men allowed to kiss the girls too ? " .
everyone laughs . outside , a straggle of fans mill in the cold around the hotel 's back entrance .
a sleek , black mercedes shoots out of the garage 's gaping entrance and noses its way through the crowds .
a small group of young girls start to shout , it is richard gere inside the car , waving majestically from its dark inside .
passersby stop and turn their heads , but quickly move on , hurrying in the cold , seemingly unperturbed .
after all , for berliners , it is only berlinale . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

inside , a firework of colours explodes on the screen , and viewers snuggle deeper into their red , plush seats at the berlinale palace film theatre .
it is the first day of berlin 's 53rd international film festival , and what better film to start the show with than " chicago , " rob marshall 's magnificent musical firework ? and magnificent it was .
with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .
indeed it warmed the hearts of thursday 's first audience so , that they even applauded and cheered marshall 's masterpiece when it was over .
as one spectator from a hollywood magazine said , obviously moved after the showing , he had been to berlinale for five years , but " had not experienced such response before . " grand hyatt hotel , 3.15 p.m. : hundreds of journalists struggle to get into a room which is already bursting with members of the press .
cameramen fight for the best places in front of a long , white table , on which name tags are taped : " rob marshall , director " , " catherine zeta-jones , actress " , " richard gere , actor " and " renée zellweger , actress " .
a melange of languages from all over the world mingle to form a constant buzz , which only subsides when a severe-looking bodyguard walks across the stage . a long wait later , someone starts clapping to one side of the stage .
a jet-haired , queenly looking catherine zeta-jones steps on the stage , followed by a comparatively small , lithe and blond-haired zellweger , both dressed in black .
richard gere , in grey flannel suit and spectacles , follows , with quick , light steps .
the cameramen are ordered by a bodyguard to sit down .
there is a short confusion as to who sits where , then finally , the conference begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what follows is a mixture of ongoing praise from the cast for their director , and a show of joviality from the side of the actors .
the stars are in a good mood . rob marshall is requested to give a " marshall plan " for upcoming directors who aim to film a musical , gere is asked by a serious looking german journalist to link the film to the motto of this year 's festival " towards tolerance " -lrb- which he refuses to do -rrb- , and zellweger loses herself in a gush of emotion over the " truly extraordinary " experience .
gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .
gere , suddenly wide awake grins and mouths into the microphone : " are there any women actually having orgasms now ? " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4p.m.
the organizer , rather like a pub owner calling for " last orders " , announces the last questions .
questioned on any possible rivalry between the two actresses in real life -lrb- they are rivals in the film -rrb- , catherine zeta jones flashes a smile and counters with a request that every woman in the room should kiss their next female neighbour .
a male voice shouts from somewhere in the throng : " are the men allowed to kiss the girls too ? " .
everyone laughs . outside , a straggle of fans mill in the cold around the hotel 's back entrance .
a sleek , black mercedes shoots out of the garage 's gaping entrance and noses its way through the crowds .
a small group of young girls start to shout , it is richard gere inside the car , waving majestically from its dark inside .
passersby stop and turn their heads , but quickly move on , hurrying in the cold , seemingly unperturbed .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .

he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .
in an interview earlier this week , schröder said he would consider loosening legal protections preventing layoffs , but only if employers could deliver a reasonable number of new jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its alliance for jobs initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .
and lucy liu 's -lrb- photo -rrb- appearance in thursday 's screening of " chicago " certainly made more hearts flutter than chan 's on friday . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

inside , a firework of colours explodes on the screen , and viewers snuggle deeper into their red , plush seats at the berlinale palace film theatre .
it is the first day of berlin 's 53rd international film festival , and what better film to start the show with than " chicago , " rob marshall 's magnificent musical firework ? and magnificent it was .
with its whirlwind of colourful , glittering costumes , flurry of gorgeously dressed dancers spinning across the stage and host of famous faces , " chicago " was the movie to start a festival which may equal with film venues cannes and venice in significance , but lacks the charm of these elegant , southern european coastal resorts .
indeed it warmed the hearts of thursday 's first audience so , that they even applauded and cheered marshall 's masterpiece when it was over .
as one spectator from a hollywood magazine said , obviously moved after the showing , he had been to berlinale for five years , but " had not experienced such response before . " grand hyatt hotel , 3.15 p.m. : hundreds of journalists struggle to get into a room which is already bursting with members of the press .
cameramen fight for the best places in front of a long , white table , on which name tags are taped : " rob marshall , director " , " catherine zeta-jones , actress " , " richard gere , actor " and " renée zellweger , actress " .
a melange of languages from all over the world mingle to form a constant buzz , which only subsides when a severe-looking bodyguard walks across the stage . a long wait later , someone starts clapping to one side of the stage .
a jet-haired , queenly looking catherine zeta-jones steps on the stage , followed by a comparatively small , lithe and blond-haired zellweger , both dressed in black .
richard gere , in grey flannel suit and spectacles , follows , with quick , light steps .
the cameramen are ordered by a bodyguard to sit down .
there is a short confusion as to who sits where , then finally , the conference begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what follows is a mixture of ongoing praise from the cast for their director , and a show of joviality from the side of the actors .
the stars are in a good mood . rob marshall is requested to give a " marshall plan " for upcoming directors who aim to film a musical , gere is asked by a serious looking german journalist to link the film to the motto of this year 's festival " towards tolerance " -lrb- which he refuses to do -rrb- , and zellweger loses herself in a gush of emotion over the " truly extraordinary " experience .
gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .
gere , suddenly wide awake grins and mouths into the microphone : " are there any women actually having orgasms now ? " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 4p.m.
the organizer , rather like a pub owner calling for " last orders " , announces the last questions .
questioned on any possible rivalry between the two actresses in real life -lrb- they are rivals in the film -rrb- , catherine zeta jones flashes a smile and counters with a request that every woman in the room should kiss their next female neighbour .
a male voice shouts from somewhere in the throng : " are the men allowed to kiss the girls too ? " .
everyone laughs . outside , a straggle of fans mill in the cold around the hotel 's back entrance .
a sleek , black mercedes shoots out of the garage 's gaping entrance and noses its way through the crowds .
a small group of young girls start to shout , it is richard gere inside the car , waving majestically from its dark inside .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .
and lucy liu 's -lrb- photo -rrb- appearance in thursday 's screening of " chicago " certainly made more hearts flutter than chan 's on friday . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .
and lucy liu 's -lrb- photo -rrb- appearance in thursday 's screening of " chicago " certainly made more hearts flutter than chan 's on friday . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .

bored already ?
surely not . but it was an early start for the press this morning , with the first screening at 9 a.m. , and the fight for the best seats starting long before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day began with british director michael winterbottom 's compelling new feature , " in this world . "
the contrast to yesterday 's " chicago " could n't have been greater : a tale of two afghan cousins , who flee from a refugee camp in pakistan seeking a brighter future in london , " in this world " is a film full of striking , yet disturbing images , of wide , dusty landscapes , of a journey so arduous and threatening that one is constantly aware of the desperation that lies behind it .
based on hundreds of first-hand accounts , the film covers the danger of the young men 's trek through the icy snow on turkey 's border , their three-day confinement in a container on board a ship to italy and their many encounters with both friends and foes on their dangerous trek .
such is the intimacy of winterbottom 's digital video production that the atmosphere at berlinale palace could have been cut with a knife .
once the credits were over many in the audience remained seated . hotel grand hyatt , 10.45 a.m. : journalists , still with a stunned look on their faces , file into the press room .
michael winterbottom -lrb- photo -rrb- looks in his brown tracksuit jacket surprisingly young , with an air about him which seems to contradict the seriousness of his film .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the q & a press conference game is soon replaced by a string of anecdotes told by winterbottom and his colleagues , such as the iranian guard who only let the film team shoot at a border control if he was given a role in the film .
indeed , that is exactly how things turned out , winterbottom recalls .
what started off as fiction soon became fact : following the film , main character jamal made the same trip to britain on his own - with limited success .
he is allowed to stay in the country until he is eighteen . looking a little proud , winterbottom says " jamal now goes to school and is top of his class . " with his film , winterbottom says he wanted to give at least two people a new start in life and that he hoped that people would imagine what such a trek was like and would " sympathize with asylum seekers . "
grinning , he adds " obviously i would like to change the world . " 11.45 a.m. : migration as a theme dominated day two at the berlinale , with hong kong powerhouse jackie chan 's " the traces of the dragon " showing at a nearby cinema .
no , not another hollywood blockbuster starring one of the world 's favorite action heroes .
this documentary reveals some dark secrets in chan 's own family .
secrets , he says , which " shocked " him , including his father 's hidden past as a former spy .
asked why he did n't direct the film himself , chan , who looks somewhat frail in a black suit and rather long , unkempt hair , grins and replies " when i am 60 i can do that - right now i want to act . " later , chan says it is a film for his european viewers , who prefer asian style to hollywood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regarding the number of press members , who slowly start filing out of the room , this may seem a little questionable .
and lucy liu 's -lrb- photo -rrb- appearance in thursday 's screening of " chicago " certainly made more hearts flutter than chan 's on friday . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .
but , he adds , it is also a question of the future of the plattenbau .
the population in eastern germany is turning its backs on those high-rise apartment blocks which were once the hallmark of their former country .
one million apartments now stand vacant in what was once a socialist society .
after the fall of the wall , more than a million easterners migrated to the west in search of jobs , and economically successful eastern germans headed for the countryside outside the city . in an effort to prevent more vacancies , housing companies have attempted to renovate and modernise prefabricated apartments all over the country .
but thousands of apartments have been left to rot , to vandalism , and eventually to demolition .
the museum does not belittle the situation of the plattenbau .
nor does it follow berlin 's recent plattenbau trend , when the capital ’ s creative youngsters declared prefab housing trendy and lifestylish .
it is a reminder of the history and identity of life in the former gdr .
ehrlich points a finger to a collection of bits of facade , in various colours , lying to one side of the former factory grounds .
" difficult to believe , but our platte was so colourful " , he says with a laugh .

the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .
" here " , he says , pointing to a tiny guard 's hut , where watchmen once waved trucks in or out of the factory , " will be the entrance " .
the first exhibits , a heap of grey-brown mottled concrete boulders - examples of the first panels made at the factory - are to follow , presented in a large triangle box made of wood .
next come the panels from one of the most typical editions of former east german prefab building , and so on .
a few straggly bushes growing among a leftover gravel pit struggling for light will become a place to linger .
and the former chimney , now a heap of red brick rubble , will be turned into a path .
just 50 wide and 100 meters long , the museum has only the fraction of the size of a " regular " museum found in most cities today .
but this does not mean it that it has less to offer .
o 'brien calls his small , but special museums , " micromuseums " : he has built , and is working on four of these small worlds , one of which is the erich kästner museum in dresden .
here , vivitors need to pull the museum , which is like a large cupboard open , and can pull out various drawers which hold the exhibits .
in the centre of the museum there is a computer , with which the visitor can inform himself on german author erich kästner via audios and videos .
with his micromuseums , for which the architect will receive a prize from the federal culture foundation on wednesday , o 'brien hopes both to include the visitor in the exhibition , but also to link to various aspects of the main theme , as in the case of the plattenbau museum .
here , there will be information boards to supplement the exhibits , and visitors will be invited to contemplate what they read in the tiny park , the " secret garden " .
plattenbau blues his friend werner ehrlich has spent many afternoons lingering on the former factory 's grounds . " each part of the museum was made in johannstadt " , ehrlich explains .
with the museums , and the original exhibits , he hopes to bring back a sense of identity , lost with the fall of the wall and the closure of the factory .
but he particularly wants to commerorate the many people who worked at the factory .
300 people once worked at the factory in johannstadt , its closure in 1990 was a blow to the area .
for eleven years the factory was left to decay .
the roof leaked , brambles grew over concrete , graffiti covered walls .
the only visitor was the occasional fox .
not everyone is happy to see parts of the factory erected again .
" away with the dirt " was the motto of a local initiative whose members were fed up with the sight of the factory decaying with time .
the initiative fought for years for its destruction .
their prayers were eventually answered – despite an eleven year delay .
during its solitary existence , a friend of ehrlich documented the factory on film .
when he hung up the photos on the site ’ s fence , as a reminder of what once stood there , people tore the photos down , wanting to forget what once stood on this dusty spot .
ehrlich says the city missed a chance when they demolished the factory .
he says it was something to remember johannstadt for .
but with an east german unemployment rate of 18.8 percent , johannstadt ’ s citizens prefer not to be reminded of the times when jobs were abundant - and when the machines purred in the housing factory .
ehrlich takes it all with humour .
" imagine – when the wall came down , they didn ’ t even tell them to stop ! " .
but behind the laughter , ehrlich very well knows and takes to heart the concern of those waiting in avail for chancellor helmut kohl ’ s back then promised " blooming lands " .
turning their backs o 'brien has often walked the dusty grounds with ehrlich , discussing his concept for the open air museum .
the born irishman , whose first job on arrival to the city was to turn a multi-storey apartment block into an operating theatre , has a penchant for plattenbauten .
he says his fascination lies in the many subjects closely linked to the platte : industrial housing production , life in modules and , in the case of the plattenbau museum , dealing with derelict land and the recycling of history .

on wednesday he receives an award for his work . it is no place for a museum .
this desolate , dusty spot on the outskirts of dresden , frequented by the odd fox from a neighbouring cemetery , is a popular training ground for teenage bmx-bikers .
for ruairi o ’ brien , it is a historical site , one to be remembered .
ruairi o ’ brien stands among heaps of sand and concrete rubble on what was once a housing factory and speaks of " making history alive again " .
any remnants of history , of the factory which churned out panel after panel essential for those pre-fabricated apartment blocks so typical for the former gdr , have long disappeared .
what is left is a collection of concrete boulders resting at o ’ brien ’ s feet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich and ruairi o 'brian in dresden .
they are , one could almost say , his pride and joy .
o ’ brien -lrb- right -rrb- and his friend , werner ehrlich -lrb- left -rrb- , spent numerous mornings during the factory ’ s demolition on the building site , and managed to save several examples of concrete panels and steel girders from the excavator ’ s fangs .
" with these fragments , you can recount history " , o ’ brien says , eager to tell their tale .
state symbol world war two left 18.4 million east germans in need of an apartment .
after the founding of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , the government launched a housing campaign for the mass production of millions of new flats .
the plattenbau , short platte , soon became an , albeit unintentional , symbol of the former gdr .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner ehrlich was one of the " lucky ones " to move into a new , modern apartment in the dresden district of johannstadt , an apartment block built with panels from the local factory .
the first panels fabricated at the factory were made out of rubble from what was left of dresden after the bombing .
ehrlich ’ s four walls may not be as historic , but they still mean more to him than the apartment 's breathtaking view over dresden and full central heating which he had not experienced in his previous home .
" the platte stands for the birth of the city , " he says : without the factory , johannstadt , as it is today , would never have been born .
due to poor sight , ehrlich had to give up his job as a clerk years ago .
instead , he took on a job for the town ’ s culture council , dedicating himself to johannstadt ’ s culture and history .
ehrlich wanted to rescue the factory , and turn it into artists ’ studios or a youth centre .
he couldn ’ t rescue the building , but together with o ’ brien , he did manage to save at least parts of the factory .
these remnants are due to be be displayed in their open air museum , later this year .
collage of fragments o ’ brien strides down a small strip of the parched landscape which was once the factory .
the city of dresden handed over the strip to them after some weeks of persuasion , and left it to them " to make something out of it " - at least until it fell into the hands of an investor .

nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .
but if one nation objects , the plan could be scuttled because the north atlantic treaty organization works on a principle of unanimity .

but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .

nato has still not decided on giving military aid to turkey in the event of an iraq war .
but the alliance 's leader says the end dispute is only about timing , not about the issue itself . nato leaders on thursday decided to wait until next week to reach a conclusion on a plan to provide turkey with airborne surveillance and air defense missiles during a possible war on iraq .
the plan will take effect if no country objects to it , said the alliance 's secretary-general , george roberston . "
i am confident that we will reach a decision early next week , " robertson said .
but if one nation objects , the plan could be scuttled because the north atlantic treaty organization works on a principle of unanimity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson in a statement , robertson acknowledged that there was a disagreement on the issue among alliance members .
" where there has been a disagreement it is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan , " he said .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive two forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance and patriot air-defense missiles .
three countries raise objections opposition has arisen from germany , belgium and france .
the issue is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
but germans serve in the surveillance planes , and if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
before thursday 's meeting of the north atlantic council , belgium 's defense minister expressed his doubts about the plan 's timing .
in a radio interview , andre flahaut said a decision made now would be " premature and dangerous . "
in response to this opposition , roberston has pointed out to his allies that they pledged during their november summit to actively support the u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
turkey announces support in turkey , the country 's leader staked out his position on a potential war on thursday .
prime minister abdullah gül said turkey would not join a war but said his government was prepared to support those who did .
as a first step , the parliament decided on thursday to allow the u.s. military to expand its bases in turkey .
in about two weeks , the assembly also will take up a plan to allow the united states to send more troops into the country .
the united states also gained pledges of support from 10 countries in eastern europe on wednesday .
the pledge followed a similar pledge for eight other european leaders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " new europe " central europeans reject the concept of a " new " europe says a czech political commentator .

gere rolls his eyes and makes a show of looking bored . the conference reaches a peak when a danish journalist reads a letter aloud which says that every woman in the world experienced an orgasm when richard gere was awarded a golden globe .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .
in an interview earlier this week , schröder said he would consider loosening legal protections preventing layoffs , but only if employers could deliver a reasonable number of new jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its alliance for jobs initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions .

germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . german chancellor gerhard schröder has had better weeks .
the troubles got rolling with an election disaster his party , the social democrats , suffered in two states on sunday .
and the week cascaded downhill from there .
on wednesday , the country learned that more than 4.6 million people were out of work in january - 1.1 million more than the goal schröder once set for his government .
and then on thursday , he watched one potential means of staunching the flow of citizens into joblessness collapse .
the potential solution is called alliance for jobs .
it is a forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt the latest explosion in the tense relationship between germany 's employers and trade unions was set off thursday by dieter hundt , who leads a major employer group , the confederation of german employers ' associations .
employers seeking consensus hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
without such changes , he said , " i am afraid that we will have five million jobless , fewer apprentice training programs , and higher deficits in government budgets and social services . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
the employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
in return , the employers asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
plan produces an eruption the suggestions produced conflict instead of consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , stepped before the media on thursday and rejected any continuation of the alliance for jobs under such circumstances .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
sommer then pointed his finger at schröder .
" in this truly serious situation , chancellor gerhard schröder must decide : if he follows a path of socially just modernization , then he will win back the trust he has lost .
if he follows the preachers of laissez-faire principles , he will not achieve this goal and free our country from the stranglehold of unemployment . "
employers , unions urged to talk following the angry exchange of words , the country 's economics and labor minister appealed to both sides to return to the talks . " i expect everyone in the debate to be ready to jump over their own shadow , " wolfgang clement , a member of schröder 's social democratic party , said friday . a high-ranking member of clement 's ministry , rezzo schlauch , passed a message to the unions in a newspaper interview he gave .
with the jobless total having climbed past 4.6 million , schlauch said the unions " would not be fulfilling their position in society if they declare something off-limits " in the debate .
the union 's decision to abandon the alliance was greeted with relief by one of germany 's biggest newspapers .
" on feb .
2 , 2003 , the unions finally buried the alliance for jobs , " an editorial in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said .
" finally , they have put this empty media spectacle back where it belongs : in the desk drawer of the union functionaries . "
end to alliance urged harmen lehment of the kiel institue for world economics , suggested in an interview with dw-world that schröder also would be better off if he dropped the idea of the alliance altogether .
" the talks do n't appear to be very promising , " lehment said friday .
he acknowledged that such an approach would produce a short-term battle with germany 's unions .
" but right now there are no elections scheduled , and the government can forge ahead , " he said .
he suggested that one of the issues the government should address by itself was the very issue that sommer was defending - the legal protections set up to prevent layoffs .
" these protections act as a break on job creation , " lehment said .
under the current laws , companies have grown uncertain about the whole issue of layoffs , he said .
and the courts have added to this uncertainty by frequently granting large severance payments to employees who have challenged their layoff , he said .
by going its own way , the government could help eliminate some of this uncertainty , lehment said .
" it could create a clear picture for companies about the costs companies face when they have to lay off workers , " lehment said .
in an interview earlier this week , schröder said he would consider loosening legal protections preventing layoffs , but only if employers could deliver a reasonable number of new jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its alliance for jobs initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions .

russian writer and berlin multiculti maven wladimir kaminer surveys the films at berlinale 's international forum and concludes it 's a dog 's world . berlin -lrb- dw -rrb- - the german media is reporting which stars will be honored in the capital during their short visits and the price tag of scorcese 's latest production .
but the most interesting thing happening at berlinale is the international forum of new cinema .
although the films in competition are of the art house variety and cool films from past years are playing in the panorama program , the forum program , with its documentaries , feature and experimental films provides an insight into the world outside of europe and reflects the political indecisiveness of our time - how the fall of socialism and crisis of capitalism is influencing social conditions from africa to latin america to china .
berlinale 's organizers have been busy with preparations for the new forum program since august .
they had to view more than a 1,000 entries before they could select the program 's 52 films .
as happened last year , china is a major forum focus , once again bringing a wave of chinese films to berlin .
with these films alone you could put together a thrilling film festival .
but the organizers did n't want that - instead they came up with several focal points .
but there are still some trends to be found here : the majority of the films originate from crisis regions - they come from israel , palestine , south africa , china and hong kong .
the sharpest critique of capitalism this year comes from japan , where the economic crisis has caused incomparably more damage than in germany .
south korea is also well represented .
in seoul these days there 's a new phenomenon to amaze one - homeless people who ply the streets with gucci suits , victims of the stock market crash who , unlike their german and american colleagues , did n't manage to put anything aside in time .
the germans have also delivered a strong film about america . "
golden lemons " is a documentary about the hamburg-based band the goldene zitronen as they tour across the u.s. another exception to the list of films with anti-american themes comes from vietnam and deals with corruption in its own country .
russia , too , is represented with one film in the forum program - and it 's a love story .
it 's called " gololed , " it 's by michail breschinskey , but i have n't seen it yet .
the u.s. is also making a pretty weak showing in the forum program this year , even though there were many american submissions .
it seems neither the russians nor the americans apparently are capable of keeping up with the chinese when it comes to documenting the crazy times we 're living in .
another trend that 's become apparent in this year 's forum is the so-called " dog syndrome , " which is most visible in the chinese film , " cala , my dog . "
more and more dogs seem to be getting important roles in movies these days .
but this is n't like the earlier days of " lassie , " when they were deployed as human-loving pooches trained to pull small babies out of the water .
the movie dogs of today are used as vehicles to portray the loneliness of man in modern society .
in this sense , the inner monologues as a stylistic device is undergoing a renaissance : the hero no longer talks to himself , he talks to his dog .
because of that , the inner monologue comes across as more genuine .
besides , dogs are better actors - at least when it comes to reality cinema .
the behave themselves more authentically in front of the camera , the mostly act like themselves , they hardly earn anything , they 're usually in a good mood and they ca n't talk , which can be an enormous help for scriptwriters .

mrs clark 's conviction for the murder of her two baby sons was overturned by the appeal court last week .
the 38-year-old from wilmslow , cheshire , always maintained she had not killed 11-week-old christopher and eight-week-old harry .
lord mitchell , a labour peer and friend of mrs clark 's father , said lessons needed to be learnt from her case .
fatally infection he said one expert witness at mrs clark 's trial had wrongly stated that the chances of two cot deaths in one family were one in 73 million .
a pathologist had also testified that the second baby had been healthy when he died , when in fact there was evidence that the baby was fatally infected .
lord mitchell added : " mrs clark was lucky , in that she was a solicitor .
" but what of those who are currently in prison , serving sentences for similar crimes where the prosecution has used identical expert witnesses , and who did not know how the system operates ?
where is their justice ? "
' tragic case ' home office minister lord falconer of thoroton described it as " a tragic case " .
the government is awaiting the court 's written judgment to see what lessons needed to be learned .
there was a need to ensure that the independence of expert witnesses could be relied on , lord falconer added .
he told peers : " the worry is always that either the competence or the arrogance of an expert deprives other parties of the opportunity to look at the full case . "

the director of st john 's hospice in st john 's wood said most of their clients came from westminster to visit the day centre .
they relied on volunteer drivers picking them up from their homes .
but he claimed the effects of paying the charge would both deter volunteers and put a huge strain on the hospice 's budget .
the only alternative is to cut our services , which is the last thing we want to do nigel harding , st john 's hospice nigel harding said there were 19 beds in the unit and a large day centre , often caring for people with aids and cancer .
half its £ 2.5m running costs come from health authorities and the other half by fund-raising .
mr harding told bbc london that not only do volunteers drive patients around , but they help with the fund-raising , using their own cars .
" who 's going to travel on public transport these days , whether it 's the bus or tube , carrying a can of money ?
it just would n't be safe for them , " he said .
' cut services ' he estimated refunding the charge to its volunteers would cost the hospice about £ 25-30,000 a year which they would not be able to recoup .
" we have no opportunity to increase the funding to cover it .
so the only alternative is to cut our services , which is the last thing we want to do , " he added .
transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- said as the hospice is not affiliated to the nhs it does not qualify for an exemption from the charge .
mr harding said the congestion charge system did not make allowances for such a unique case .

officials have vowed to use " an iron fist " against any terrorist group trying to disrupt the pilgrimage . "
" our precautionary security measures for hajj this year are of the highest order " interior minister prince nayef special forces soldiers wearing black balaclavas joined 3,000 troops and police on parade for a show of strength outside mecca .
armoured cars and water cannon were also deployed at the display near mount arafat to show saudi arabia 's readiness to maintain law and order .
regional threat every year about two million muslims converge on mecca and medina - the two holiest places in islam - to take part in the five-day pilgrimage .
the hajj has not seen a major protest since 1987 when shia muslims , mostly from iran , started a riot with saudi arabian police during an anti-us protest in which 402 people were killed .
however , this year 's gathering is taking place amid escalating tensions over the prospect of a us-led military attack on iraq .
and there are concerns that , as a long-time ally of the us , saudi arabia could become the target of islamist violence .
interior minister prince nayef said : " our precautionary security measures for hajj this year are of the highest order .
" terrorist organisations seeking to tamper with our security during the hajj will be dealt an iron fist , " he added .
" it is normal to take security measures and it is normal to prepare for the worst .
" hajj remains the priority for the pilgrims and i hope nothing will happen , " prince nayef said after watching the parade outside mecca .
in mohammed 's footsteps helicopters have been hovering over sacred sites and pilgrims have been checked at police roadblocks at entrances .
the bbc 's russell trott says a tent city has been built at mecca to house the pilgrims .
officials say about 1.2 million pilgrims from around the world are expected to join about one million residents from the kingdom for the hajj .
during the event - one of the five pillars of islam - pilgrims follow the footsteps of the prophet mohammed .
the annual rite culminates on 10 february with the eid al-adha , the feast of sacrifice .

historians want to know if the roof on a 16th century building in llanidloes is one of the finest examples of its kind in wales - or was simply made from bits plundered from a nearby abbey .
a number of churches from the time were built of crafted stone stolen from monasteries closed by henry viii .
but experts want to find out if st idloes ' impressive timber-arched roof was also hauled the 15 miles from the nearest abbey .
samples drilled from the roof will undergo tests based on dendrochronology , the science of dating objects based on tree-ring growth .
the tests are accurate to within a few months and should date the timbers atop st idloes once and for all .
historian charles kightley is confident the date-testing will put the age of the structure beyond doubt .
he said : " if we can get a tree-ring date from it , and if we find that it was done from trees cut in say , 1540 , we 'll know that it was actually made purpose-built for this church . "
if the roof is not a plundered impostor , but custom-made for the church , it will be the latest example of its kind in wales .
it is set to make a fitting centrepiece for an exhibition at the town 's , famous 17th century market hall , tracing the history of timber-framed buildings .
after six centuries , it seems this historic church is at last about to give up its secrets .
