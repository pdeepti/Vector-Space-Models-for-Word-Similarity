fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .

" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .

but it especially intensified following the sept .

amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .

but unfortunately it doesn ’ t appear to work .
toll collect on wednesday said around 30 percent of the onboard computers from the firm grundig don ’ t work properly .
the recall affects 20,000 of some 175,000 already installed units , but the consortium maintains it will not hinder the start of the system ’ s test phase .

a government spokesman on wednesday had to deny that german chancellor gerhard schröder had called telekom ceo kai-uwe ricke to discuss the problems with the toll system .
politicians across the spectrum have become increasingly critical of toll collect and stolpe for not supposedly taking the consortium to task for the technical problems .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .

schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .
" that is why the united nations was created , and i find it very important that we don ’ t violate that , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de texts of leaders ' speeches before the united nations read the entire transcripts of un secretary general kofi annan , u.s. president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac 's speeches before the united nations general assembly in new york .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .
" that is why the united nations was created , and i find it very important that we don ’ t violate that , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de texts of leaders ' speeches before the united nations read the entire transcripts of un secretary general kofi annan , u.s. president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac 's speeches before the united nations general assembly in new york .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2003 german states move to enact headscarf bans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a short-lived victory ?
fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .
the german weekly die zeit wrote that by passing the issue back to the state level , the constitutional court had allowed authorities to make their own laws .
" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .
a divisive issue across europe the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family as laid down in the koran , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .
an exasperated jebril told swedish television last weekend , " i am a human being with a lot of feelings and thoughts , not just a piece of cloth . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says headscarf is religious symbol for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .
the german weekly die zeit wrote that by passing the issue back to the state level , the constitutional court had allowed authorities to make their own laws .
" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .
a divisive issue across europe the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family as laid down in the koran , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .
an exasperated jebril told swedish television last weekend , " i am a human being with a lot of feelings and thoughts , not just a piece of cloth . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court says headscarf is religious symbol for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.09.2003 belgium drops war crimes cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both bushes became subjects of possible war crimes charges under the controversial belgian law .
belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon the cases against israeli prime minister ariel sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- and general yamos aron accused them of being responsible for a 1982 massacre of palestinians by a lebanese christian militia in the sabra and chatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
the belgian government appeared relieved at the court ’ s decision .
" as long as complaints based on the universal jurisdiction law were not thrown out , we can not resume -lrb- high level -rrb- official contacts with the united states , " belgian foreign minister louis michel said wednesday .
" we are satisfied with the decision , " israeli embassy spokesman laurent reichman told ap .

under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .

relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .

on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.09.2003 germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " only the united nations has the legitimacy to rebuild iraq . "
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .

in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .
" that is why the united nations was created , and i find it very important that we don ’ t violate that , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de texts of leaders ' speeches before the united nations read the entire transcripts of un secretary general kofi annan , u.s. president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac 's speeches before the united nations general assembly in new york .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .

the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .

amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .

amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .

but he also cautioned against jumping to conclusions after the arrest saying , “ this is the beginning of a long and difficult investigation . ” jennekvist said the man resembled the person filmed by store security cameras at the time of lindh ’ s death .
lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular politicians and often tipped as a future prime minister , was brutally stabbed by a man on september 10 while shopping without body guards . lindh was a leading member of the pro-euro campaign to get sweden to join the euro zone , but police have said there is so far no evidence of a political motive for the killing .
despite an upsurge in sympathy for lindh ’ s pro-euro views , swedes chose to keep the krona on sunday by a large margin . plain-clothes police arrested the unarmed suspect , who has not yet been named , at 9:07 p.m. local time outside a pub-restaurant near sweden 's national football stadium råsunda in a north stockholm suburb after other patrons had recognized him . man reportedly unstable according to the swedish tt news agency , the suspect was a 35-year-old man with 18 previous convictions for crimes such as fraud and theft as well as violence and threats involving knives .
a psychiatric examination in 2002 linked to one of these offences found the man was not mentally ill , tt said . under swedish law , criminals declared mentally ill can not be sentenced to jail but must undergo psychiatric treatment instead .
doctors have said the man has a narcissistic personality , and he has reportedly told a court he abused cocaine and alcohol . “ we will question the man who has been brought in , then we will let medical and legal experts examine him , ” said jennekvist . the man has not yet been charged , as the authorities continued with tests to compare the man ’ s dna with samples left on the murder weapon and a baseball cap left at the scene .
under immense pressure to make progress in the investigation , the swedish police have called in help from british and german forensic experts . the desire of most swedes to see lindh ’ s murderer brought to justice has been compounded by the fact that the 1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme remains unsolved .
like lindh , palme did not have any bodyguards with him when he was shot in stockholm . dw-world with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

but he also cautioned against jumping to conclusions after the arrest saying , “ this is the beginning of a long and difficult investigation . ” jennekvist said the man resembled the person filmed by store security cameras at the time of lindh ’ s death .
lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular politicians and often tipped as a future prime minister , was brutally stabbed by a man on september 10 while shopping without body guards . lindh was a leading member of the pro-euro campaign to get sweden to join the euro zone , but police have said there is so far no evidence of a political motive for the killing .
despite an upsurge in sympathy for lindh ’ s pro-euro views , swedes chose to keep the krona on sunday by a large margin . plain-clothes police arrested the unarmed suspect , who has not yet been named , at 9:07 p.m. local time outside a pub-restaurant near sweden 's national football stadium råsunda in a north stockholm suburb after other patrons had recognized him . man reportedly unstable according to the swedish tt news agency , the suspect was a 35-year-old man with 18 previous convictions for crimes such as fraud and theft as well as violence and threats involving knives .

under immense pressure to make progress in the investigation , the swedish police have called in help from british and german forensic experts . the desire of most swedes to see lindh ’ s murderer brought to justice has been compounded by the fact that the 1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme remains unsolved .

but he also cautioned against jumping to conclusions after the arrest saying , “ this is the beginning of a long and difficult investigation . ” jennekvist said the man resembled the person filmed by store security cameras at the time of lindh ’ s death .
lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular politicians and often tipped as a future prime minister , was brutally stabbed by a man on september 10 while shopping without body guards . lindh was a leading member of the pro-euro campaign to get sweden to join the euro zone , but police have said there is so far no evidence of a political motive for the killing .
despite an upsurge in sympathy for lindh ’ s pro-euro views , swedes chose to keep the krona on sunday by a large margin . plain-clothes police arrested the unarmed suspect , who has not yet been named , at 9:07 p.m. local time outside a pub-restaurant near sweden 's national football stadium råsunda in a north stockholm suburb after other patrons had recognized him . man reportedly unstable according to the swedish tt news agency , the suspect was a 35-year-old man with 18 previous convictions for crimes such as fraud and theft as well as violence and threats involving knives .
a psychiatric examination in 2002 linked to one of these offences found the man was not mentally ill , tt said . under swedish law , criminals declared mentally ill can not be sentenced to jail but must undergo psychiatric treatment instead .
doctors have said the man has a narcissistic personality , and he has reportedly told a court he abused cocaine and alcohol . “ we will question the man who has been brought in , then we will let medical and legal experts examine him , ” said jennekvist . the man has not yet been charged , as the authorities continued with tests to compare the man ’ s dna with samples left on the murder weapon and a baseball cap left at the scene .
under immense pressure to make progress in the investigation , the swedish police have called in help from british and german forensic experts . the desire of most swedes to see lindh ’ s murderer brought to justice has been compounded by the fact that the 1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme remains unsolved .
like lindh , palme did not have any bodyguards with him when he was shot in stockholm . dw-world with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .

" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .

but it especially intensified following the sept .

amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .

in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .
the german weekly die zeit wrote that by passing the issue back to the state level , the constitutional court had allowed authorities to make their own laws .
" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .
a divisive issue across europe the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family as laid down in the koran , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .
an exasperated jebril told swedish television last weekend , " i am a human being with a lot of feelings and thoughts , not just a piece of cloth .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .

he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .
the german weekly die zeit wrote that by passing the issue back to the state level , the constitutional court had allowed authorities to make their own laws .
" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .
a divisive issue across europe the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family as laid down in the koran , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.09.2003 belgium drops war crimes cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both bushes became subjects of possible war crimes charges under the controversial belgian law .
belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon the cases against israeli prime minister ariel sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- and general yamos aron accused them of being responsible for a 1982 massacre of palestinians by a lebanese christian militia in the sabra and chatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
the belgian government appeared relieved at the court ’ s decision .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon the cases against israeli prime minister ariel sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- and general yamos aron accused them of being responsible for a 1982 massacre of palestinians by a lebanese christian militia in the sabra and chatilla refugee camps in lebanon .

but he also cautioned against jumping to conclusions after the arrest saying , “ this is the beginning of a long and difficult investigation . ” jennekvist said the man resembled the person filmed by store security cameras at the time of lindh ’ s death .
lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular politicians and often tipped as a future prime minister , was brutally stabbed by a man on september 10 while shopping without body guards . lindh was a leading member of the pro-euro campaign to get sweden to join the euro zone , but police have said there is so far no evidence of a political motive for the killing .
despite an upsurge in sympathy for lindh ’ s pro-euro views , swedes chose to keep the krona on sunday by a large margin . plain-clothes police arrested the unarmed suspect , who has not yet been named , at 9:07 p.m. local time outside a pub-restaurant near sweden 's national football stadium råsunda in a north stockholm suburb after other patrons had recognized him . man reportedly unstable according to the swedish tt news agency , the suspect was a 35-year-old man with 18 previous convictions for crimes such as fraud and theft as well as violence and threats involving knives .
a psychiatric examination in 2002 linked to one of these offences found the man was not mentally ill , tt said . under swedish law , criminals declared mentally ill can not be sentenced to jail but must undergo psychiatric treatment instead .
doctors have said the man has a narcissistic personality , and he has reportedly told a court he abused cocaine and alcohol . “ we will question the man who has been brought in , then we will let medical and legal experts examine him , ” said jennekvist . the man has not yet been charged , as the authorities continued with tests to compare the man ’ s dna with samples left on the murder weapon and a baseball cap left at the scene .
under immense pressure to make progress in the investigation , the swedish police have called in help from british and german forensic experts . the desire of most swedes to see lindh ’ s murderer brought to justice has been compounded by the fact that the 1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme remains unsolved .

lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular politicians and often tipped as a future prime minister , was brutally stabbed by a man on september 10 while shopping without body guards . lindh was a leading member of the pro-euro campaign to get sweden to join the euro zone , but police have said there is so far no evidence of a political motive for the killing .
despite an upsurge in sympathy for lindh ’ s pro-euro views , swedes chose to keep the krona on sunday by a large margin . plain-clothes police arrested the unarmed suspect , who has not yet been named , at 9:07 p.m. local time outside a pub-restaurant near sweden 's national football stadium råsunda in a north stockholm suburb after other patrons had recognized him . man reportedly unstable according to the swedish tt news agency , the suspect was a 35-year-old man with 18 previous convictions for crimes such as fraud and theft as well as violence and threats involving knives .
a psychiatric examination in 2002 linked to one of these offences found the man was not mentally ill , tt said . under swedish law , criminals declared mentally ill can not be sentenced to jail but must undergo psychiatric treatment instead .

under immense pressure to make progress in the investigation , the swedish police have called in help from british and german forensic experts . the desire of most swedes to see lindh ’ s murderer brought to justice has been compounded by the fact that the 1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme remains unsolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.09.2003 belgium drops war crimes cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both bushes became subjects of possible war crimes charges under the controversial belgian law .
belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon the cases against israeli prime minister ariel sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- and general yamos aron accused them of being responsible for a 1982 massacre of palestinians by a lebanese christian militia in the sabra and chatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
the belgian government appeared relieved at the court ’ s decision .
" as long as complaints based on the universal jurisdiction law were not thrown out , we can not resume -lrb- high level -rrb- official contacts with the united states , " belgian foreign minister louis michel said wednesday .
" we are satisfied with the decision , " israeli embassy spokesman laurent reichman told ap .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .
the german weekly die zeit wrote that by passing the issue back to the state level , the constitutional court had allowed authorities to make their own laws .
" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .
a divisive issue across europe the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family as laid down in the koran , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.09.2003 germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " only the united nations has the legitimacy to rebuild iraq . "
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .
" that is why the united nations was created , and i find it very important that we don ’ t violate that , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de texts of leaders ' speeches before the united nations read the entire transcripts of un secretary general kofi annan , u.s. president george w. bush and french president jacques chirac 's speeches before the united nations general assembly in new york .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .

amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .

germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon the cases against israeli prime minister ariel sharon -lrb- photo -rrb- and general yamos aron accused them of being responsible for a 1982 massacre of palestinians by a lebanese christian militia in the sabra and chatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
the belgian government appeared relieved at the court ’ s decision .
" as long as complaints based on the universal jurisdiction law were not thrown out , we can not resume -lrb- high level -rrb- official contacts with the united states , " belgian foreign minister louis michel said wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.09.2003 germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder : " only the united nations has the legitimacy to rebuild iraq . "
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .

in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.09.2003 belgium drops war crimes cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both bushes became subjects of possible war crimes charges under the controversial belgian law .
belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .

the belgian government appeared relieved at the court ’ s decision .
" as long as complaints based on the universal jurisdiction law were not thrown out , we can not resume -lrb- high level -rrb- official contacts with the united states , " belgian foreign minister louis michel said wednesday .
" we are satisfied with the decision , " israeli embassy spokesman laurent reichman told ap .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .
the unusual origin of the suits can be traced back to belgium ’ s controversial 1993 universal-jurisdiction genocide law , which allowed anyone to file genocide and war crimes complaints against foreign leaders until last august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genocide in rwanda first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide -lrb- photo -rrb- in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures including current u.s. president george w. bush , british prime minister tony blair , retired u.s. general tommy franks and , more famously , former chilean military dictator augusto pinochet .
a thorn in the side the contentious law caused brussels much diplomatic grief because it gave courts the power to try war crimes cases irrespective of where the alleged crimes were committed and regardless of the victim or perpetrator ’ s identity .
it flooded the country 's courts with cases against a number of world leaders including cuban president fidel castro and palestinian leader yasser arafat .
under intense international pressure , belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
the changes stipulated that human-rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a belgian citizen or long-term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
in addition , the belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high-level officials visiting the country .
decision could placate washingon wednesday ’ s decision to drop the high-profile cases is likely to appease the u.s. , which became infuriated when the end of the iraq war saw a string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current president george w. bush , defense secretary donald rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , gen. tommy franks .
relations between belgium and the united states plummeted to all-time lows as washington argued the law simply provided an opportunity for campaigners - including special interest groups - to bring politically motivated cases .
rumsfeld threatened to move nato headquarters out of brussels because he said u.s. diplomats no longer felt safe and welcome in the country .
in addition , rumsfeld also vowed to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
under the recent changes to the act , the cases against bush and british prime minister tony blair are unlikely to ever come to court .
on tuesday , a belgian court also quashed a case against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq . seventeen iraqis and two jordanians sought to press charges against the general , because , they allege , he gave the go-ahead for the use of cluster bombs against civilians during the war .
representatives of the families of seven iraqis killed or injured during the 1991 persian gulf war filed complaints accusing george bush , secretary of state colin powell and current u.s. vice-president dick cheney having committed war crimes .

the belgian government appeared relieved at the court ’ s decision .

belgium ’ s highest court threw out war crimes cases against george bush and ariel sharon on wednesday , citing the lack of a legal basis .
the move will likely reduce diplomatic tensions between brussels and washington . former united states president george bush and israeli prime minister ariel sharon will no longer have to appear in a belgium court to answer to charges of crimes against humanity .
a belgium court on wednesday dismissed the cases against sharon , bush and israeli gen. amos yaron on grounds that the country ’ s courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial .
the appeals court in brussels further said that none of the accused had been belgian citizens at the time when the alleged crimes were committed .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .
the german weekly die zeit wrote that by passing the issue back to the state level , the constitutional court had allowed authorities to make their own laws .
" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .
a divisive issue across europe the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family as laid down in the koran , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .

but he also cautioned against jumping to conclusions after the arrest saying , “ this is the beginning of a long and difficult investigation . ” jennekvist said the man resembled the person filmed by store security cameras at the time of lindh ’ s death .
lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular politicians and often tipped as a future prime minister , was brutally stabbed by a man on september 10 while shopping without body guards . lindh was a leading member of the pro-euro campaign to get sweden to join the euro zone , but police have said there is so far no evidence of a political motive for the killing .
despite an upsurge in sympathy for lindh ’ s pro-euro views , swedes chose to keep the krona on sunday by a large margin . plain-clothes police arrested the unarmed suspect , who has not yet been named , at 9:07 p.m. local time outside a pub-restaurant near sweden 's national football stadium råsunda in a north stockholm suburb after other patrons had recognized him . man reportedly unstable according to the swedish tt news agency , the suspect was a 35-year-old man with 18 previous convictions for crimes such as fraud and theft as well as violence and threats involving knives .
a psychiatric examination in 2002 linked to one of these offences found the man was not mentally ill , tt said . under swedish law , criminals declared mentally ill can not be sentenced to jail but must undergo psychiatric treatment instead .
doctors have said the man has a narcissistic personality , and he has reportedly told a court he abused cocaine and alcohol . “ we will question the man who has been brought in , then we will let medical and legal experts examine him , ” said jennekvist . the man has not yet been charged , as the authorities continued with tests to compare the man ’ s dna with samples left on the murder weapon and a baseball cap left at the scene .
under immense pressure to make progress in the investigation , the swedish police have called in help from british and german forensic experts . the desire of most swedes to see lindh ’ s murderer brought to justice has been compounded by the fact that the 1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme remains unsolved .

but he also cautioned against jumping to conclusions after the arrest saying , “ this is the beginning of a long and difficult investigation . ” jennekvist said the man resembled the person filmed by store security cameras at the time of lindh ’ s death .
lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular politicians and often tipped as a future prime minister , was brutally stabbed by a man on september 10 while shopping without body guards . lindh was a leading member of the pro-euro campaign to get sweden to join the euro zone , but police have said there is so far no evidence of a political motive for the killing .
despite an upsurge in sympathy for lindh ’ s pro-euro views , swedes chose to keep the krona on sunday by a large margin . plain-clothes police arrested the unarmed suspect , who has not yet been named , at 9:07 p.m. local time outside a pub-restaurant near sweden 's national football stadium råsunda in a north stockholm suburb after other patrons had recognized him . man reportedly unstable according to the swedish tt news agency , the suspect was a 35-year-old man with 18 previous convictions for crimes such as fraud and theft as well as violence and threats involving knives .
a psychiatric examination in 2002 linked to one of these offences found the man was not mentally ill , tt said . under swedish law , criminals declared mentally ill can not be sentenced to jail but must undergo psychiatric treatment instead .
doctors have said the man has a narcissistic personality , and he has reportedly told a court he abused cocaine and alcohol . “ we will question the man who has been brought in , then we will let medical and legal experts examine him , ” said jennekvist . the man has not yet been charged , as the authorities continued with tests to compare the man ’ s dna with samples left on the murder weapon and a baseball cap left at the scene .
under immense pressure to make progress in the investigation , the swedish police have called in help from british and german forensic experts . the desire of most swedes to see lindh ’ s murderer brought to justice has been compounded by the fact that the 1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme remains unsolved .
like lindh , palme did not have any bodyguards with him when he was shot in stockholm . dw-world with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .

the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .

baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .

other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .

ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .

fereshta ludin won the right to teach with her headscarf .
germany ’ s highest court confirmed the right of a female muslim teacher to wear a headscarf in the classroom , but also said states could choose to enact legislation banning the same .
that ’ s exactly what many plan to do . fereshta ludin ’ s victory was a short-lived one .
a day after germany ’ s constitutional court ruled in her favor and said stuttgart school authorities were wrong to bar her from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom , several german states have announced plans to change their laws to enact such a ban .
ludin , a 31-year-old afghanistan native was banned from taking up post to teach english and german teacher in primary and secondary schools in 1998 , because she insisted on wearing her headscarf , or hijab as it is known in arabic , in the classroom for religious reasons .
the board of education in the state of baden württemberg argued at the time that her headscarf would violate the state ’ s neutrality on religion .
since then ludin , who became a german citizen in 1995 , has seen her case move through a string of german courts - from the municipal level all the way to germany 's highest court .
court : states need clear laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court on wednesday , the constitutional court -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed in its ruling that though germany ’ s constitutional law did not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in the classroom in state-run schools in the first place , the possibility remained for states to legally enact such a ban .
the court stressed that the german state ’ s neutrality on religion shouldn ’ t be understood as a strict separation of church and state .
thus , if federal states didn ’ t want to employ teachers wearing a headscarf , they would first need to create unambiguous laws that expressly forbid religious symbols in the classroom , the court said .
in ludin ’ s case , such a legal ban wasn ’ t in place in the state of baden-württemberg , it noted .
most german states in favor of legal ban a string of german states have now issued statements saying they plan to introduce legislation that would ban muslim teachers from wearing the headscarf in the future in state-run schools and thus preserve the states ' neutral stance on religion .
the state of hesse was one of the first to react .
" our constitution is based on a christian-occidental tradition and portrays a value system , which the teachers have to follow , " education minister karin wolff of the conservative christian democratic union party said .
she added the state " would begin to draw up legislation to ban headscarves in the classroom as soon as possible . "
baden-württemberg education minister annette schavan , also a christian democrat , said after the decision she would examine the ruling in closer detail .
" after that the state parliament will decide if baden-württemberg should have such a legal regulation in place , " she said , thus dampening ludin ’ s hopes that she will be able to teach in the state in the future while wearing a headscarf .
authorities in traditionally catholic bavaria , who fought a long battle to keep the right to display crucifixes in the classroom in 1995 , said in a statement , " if necessary we will pass an appropriate state law .
in any case , we want to make sure that teachers can not wear headscarves in state schools . "
other states , including lower-saxony , bremen and berlin , have also announced they will introduce legislation to enact a headscarf ban in schools .
lower-saxony education minister bernd busemann stressed , " the state ’ s responsibility for religious neutrality is an indispensable thing , that shouldn ’ t be allowed to be diluted . "
partial victory for muslims but wednesday ’ s decision was still a partial victory for ludin , who has been battling for five years to get her headscarf accepted in the classroom .
talking to reporters outside the court on wednesday , ludin said : " for years in all the court cases i felt stigmatized just because i wear a headscarf .
the decision is a big relief for me . "
ludin , who has always stressed that both her religion as well as the democratic values of her new country belong to her identity , told german news agency dpa recently : " how can i teach emancipation and tolerance , when i feel oppressed myself ? "
germany 's central council of muslims , which represents more than 3 million muslims in the country , said the ruling gave muslim women more work opportunities and independence .
" the ruling takes into account the fact that headscarves in germany have long been a part of everyday life , " the council said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women but some observers feared the judgement could rebound on muslim women by leading to more draconian local moves against headscarves in school .
the german weekly die zeit wrote that by passing the issue back to the state level , the constitutional court had allowed authorities to make their own laws .
" then nothing will stop there being a decisive ' no ' to headscarves .
the judges were too cowardly to resolve the argument , " the paper wrote .
a divisive issue across europe the hijab , or headscarf , meant to shield muslim women from the eyes of men outside their family as laid down in the koran , has been the subject of growing debate in several parts of europe for more than a decade .
but it especially intensified following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington .
amid heightened fears that wearing a veil is a symbol of fundamentalist islam , the headscarf issue on another level also reflects sensitive topics such as the modern secular identities of european states , the compatibility of islam with largely christian europe , the acceptance of immigrants , integration and religious rights .
the issue is especially controversial in neighboring france , where headscarf rows are routine at the beginning of every school year , sparking a round of wrangling between muslims , civil liberties groups and the government .
the french education ministry has even appointed a full-time staff member , dubbed " madame headscarf " in the press , to mediate between the various sides .
on wednesday , parisian school district authorities banned two muslim girls from attending class until they were willing to remove their headscarves .
even in sweden , famous for its tolerance , nadja jebril , an ethnic palestinian finally won the right to host her own cooking show on state television , after she was originally turned down for another program because of her headscarf .

"
in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given . german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush met face to face on wednesday for the first time in nearly a year and a half since their countries split in a bitter debate over the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" we have put aside our past differences , " schröder told reporters after the 40-minute meeting in new york .
bush nodded in agreement , " we ’ ve had our differences and they ’ re over , and we ’ re going to work together and i believe if germany and america work together we can achieve a lot . "
although neither leader apologized for the souring of german-american relations in the past 16 months , they did try to smooth over some of the stumbling blocks by pledging to look forward and cooperate in rebuilding iraq .
schröder , who had antagonized the bush administration by aligning with france as a vocal opponent to the u.s.-led military intervention and washington ’ s policy of preventive action , said germany was committed to helping restore peace in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush " both president bush and i agree it ’ s time to look ahead .
germany has a vested interest in a democratic and stable iraq , and to that effect , it 's not just important to iraq itself but the whole region , " the chancellor said .
he repeated his offer of training iraqi police and military in german colleges .
" we have the capacities , and we want to use them in the interest of increased security , " schröder said , but he ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country .
schröder says only u.n. can help iraq later in the afternoon schröder reiterated germany ’ s commitment to securing peace in iraq when he addressed the united nations general assembly .
he emphasized the importance of giving the world body a greater role in rebuilding iraq .
" only the united nations can guarantee the legitimacy necessary to enable the iraqi people to rapidly rebuild their country under an independent , representative government , " he said .
germany , like france and russia , has argued for a multilateral approach to iraq , saying that the united states alone does not have the authority to establish a democratic government in the country .
earlier in the day schröder had met with french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin to reaffirm their common goals for iraq .
the three are at odds with the u.s. over a new u.n. resolution proposed by the bush administration which would give washington a broader international mandate for restoring security in occupied iraq and rebuilding its infrastructure .
all three security council members - france and russia are permanent members , germany has a rotating seat - want political power transferred to iraqi civilian authorities much quicker than the united states foresees .
a new french-german-russian axis ?

24 , 2003 .
the conservative opposition in germany warned schröder of joining forces against the bush administration , lest it jeopardize the fragile improvement in german-american relations .
the christian democrats criticized the chancellor for turning to france and russia immediately after his meeting with bush .
for many cdu politicians , the meeting between the three war opponents on the sidelines bore strong resemblance to the time before the iraq crisis .
" it was high time " schröder met with bush , cdu chairwoman angela merkel told the bild newspaper and added the lack of communication between the two leaders was " entirely unacceptable . "
germany will only have a positive future if it works together with europe and the united states , she stressed .
guido westerwelle , leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , also derided the meeting between chirac , putin and schröder as counterproductive to the cooperative spirit generated in new york and said it ran the risk of " building a new axis " before the security council votes on the new iraq resolution .
german support for iraq resolution uncertain however , schröder made it clear that germany ’ s support for the u.s.-backed resolution was not a given and that berlin could abstain from a security council vote if its conditions are not met .
" we see scope for maneuver , and on other points , we ’ ll hope for maneuver from the other side , " the chancellor said late wednesday in an interview with pbs television .
" what we are talking about here is this : is there enough common ground to wholeheartedly say ' yes , ' and if not , can we possibly end up with an abstention , " schröder explained , referring to germany ’ s insistence on a leading role for the united nations and a shorter timeframe for handing over control to the iraqi people , two issues washington is reluctant to cede on .
in the interview , schröder also criticized bush ’ s doctrine of preventive action in the form of military strikes against countries it deems a threat .
" when it comes to the question of whether it should be valid to have preemptive military action , then you always have to wonder who on earth is going to take that decision , " he said .
schröder said germany ’ s unique history and the lessons of world war ii illustrate the importance of following a course of collective security compared to unilateral action .

the scottish environment protection agency -lrb- sepa -rrb- issued the warning two days before the launch of a national flood awareness campaign .
it estimates that more than 171,000 properties in scotland are at risk of river or coastal flooding , with many more in danger from flash flooding .
the agency said it had commissioned research which suggested that only 15 % of people who were aware of local flood risks had made adequate preparations .
the mori scotland poll , which questioned 507 people , found that 71 % of those who had been flooded before had not taken any action .
sepa 's national flood warning development team manager david faichney said the situation is worrying .
" as we 've seen , the effects of flooding can be devastating , " he said .
awareness campaign " summer floods only a few months ago in the selkirk area left 20 families homeless .
" last autumn events saw the biggest recorded floods on the river dee and the south esk in angus , and damage to elgin business and residential properties was estimated at millions of pounds when the river lossie burst its banks . "
there have been 20 serious flooding incidents in scotland over the last three years .
sepa advised people living in " at risk areas " to take out adequate insurance , make a " family flood plan " , keep a list of emergency numbers and purchase products that could minimise damage .
the agency will launch its annual two-week flood awareness campaign on saturday .
national television and radio advertising will urge those who live , work or travel in flood risk areas to use the floodline .
an advertising trailer promoting the service will also travel around the country and flood fair events will be run in over the coming months .

a us federal court granted a request from the country 's top financial watchdog to block the payment to ex-vivendi boss jean-marie messier .
the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- is investigating whether vivendi broke rules on transparency during mr messier 's time at the helm .
the court ruling means mr messier 's 20.5m euros -lrb- $ 23.5m ; £ 14.2m -rrb- pay-off must be set aside in a special account while the sec inquiry continues .
no tears vivendi has said it is fully co-operating with the sec .
vivendi itself has been involved in a lengthy tussle with mr messier over the size of his golden handshake .
he stepped down as chief executive in july 2002 after being widely blamed for dragging the media group into a financial mess .
however , vivendi has made progress in turning itself around , and reported an improvement in core profits earlier in the day .
recovery operating profit rose 20 % to 1.7bn euros -lrb- £ 1.2bn -rrb- in the first half of the year , as the firm 's radical downsizing gets underway .
despite the marked improvement , the firm is still reporting a net loss of 632m euros .
but the loss , while still significant , is tiny compared to the 12.3bn euros lost the previous year .
that loss added to the firm 's 35bn euro debt mountain run up during a frenetic spending spree .
the acquisition spree has now turned into a season of sell-offs , in order to tackle the debt .
new chief executive jean-rene fourtou has launched a sweeping programme of cost-cuts and asset sales to cut vivendi 's debts .
the sell-off has included the disposal of its us show business assets , including hollywood 's universal studios , to cable tv network nbc .
vivendi said that once the sale of its entertainment arm was complete its debt would fall to under 5bn euros by the end of next year .
investors cheered the firm 's progress on wednesday by sending its shares up 2.8 % in early trade in paris .

figures from a survey published on thursday by the british lung foundation found it was one of the uk 's top five spots for respiratory diseases .
the findings reflect the industrial history of the area , with many elderly people dying of work-related lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis .
but high levels of smoking have also been identified as a factor , particularly in socially deprived areas .
killer the report , breathing fear , is based on a survey of members of the blf , and shows many live in fear of a " lung attack " - a sudden worsening of symptoms including extreme breathlessness that can lead to extended stays in hospital .
jeane brown is an emphysema sufferer , and said it changed her life completely .
" all i know is i could n't breathe , it 's like i put a plastic bag around my head or cling film , " she said .
" my heart was going a hundred to the dozen . "
early diagnosis an estimated three million people have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -lrb- copd -rrb- .
copd covers conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema .
experts said the findings highlighted the need to diagnose the condition much earlier .
" death from copd is still all too common , " said professor william macnee , of the university of edinburgh .
" we must diagnose this disease earlier and act more swiftly to prevent potentially life-threatening attacks .
the absolute misery and emptiness that has to be endured by patients with copd is totally unnecessary . "
rachel booker , a member of the british thoracic society 's consortium on copd , urged patients with symptoms of the disease to seek early medical advice .
" we want patients to present .
we need to diagnose them as early as possible , " she said .
