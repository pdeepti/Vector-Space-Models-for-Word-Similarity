gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .
the biggest social injustice is the current mass unemployment , it says , and whoever blocks reforms in this sector is driving our state and society into ruin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .

more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .

however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

germany 's federal prosecutor has concluded there is no evidence that politicians here were bribed in a deal to privatize the former east german oil refinery that has figured in a scandal involving former german chancellor helmut kohl , according to a report tuesday dec .
19 , 2001 .
swiss and french prosecutors suspect bribes were paid in the takeover of leuna by france 's elf-aquitaine .
-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- the suspects , with close ties to the country 's political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds .
the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country 's foreign-policy machine .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

germany 's federal prosecutor has concluded there is no evidence that politicians here were bribed in a deal to privatize the former east german oil refinery that has figured in a scandal involving former german chancellor helmut kohl , according to a report tuesday dec .
19 , 2001 .
swiss and french prosecutors suspect bribes were paid in the takeover of leuna by france 's elf-aquitaine .
-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- the suspects , with close ties to the country 's political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds .
the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country 's foreign-policy machine .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .

iraqi civilians are reportedly intending to bring charges in belgium against u.s. general tommy franks for war crimes , possibly further straining ties with washington after brussels ’ opposition to the war in iraq . ten iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against u.s. general tommy franks , the commander of the u.s.-led war in iraq , the american newspaper the washington times reported . the iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of u.s. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of hillah . according to the report , brussels-based human rights lawyer jan fermon , who intends to represent the iraqis , said the complaint against franks and other u.s. military officials would be filed in a belgian court in about two weeks . " u.s. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , " fermon told the newspaper .
" a military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . " poor relations the incident could further worsen relations between washington and brussels , which vehemently opposed u.s.-led military action against iraq .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt has also annoyed u.s. officials by pushing european defense proposal seen as competing with nato . belgium 's 1993 law of universal jurisdiction allows its courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian . under widespread international pressure , the law was changed in april to give judges greater scope to reject complaints .
now the senior prosecutor may decide that cases should be referred to the country directly concerned if there is no tangible belgian link , rather than being examined in a belgian court . united states fears abuse the united states on monday welcomed the recent changes to the law , but said belgium needed to make sure its legal system was not abused . " we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends , " u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher told journalists .
" as to this specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . " u.s. secretary of state colin powell recently warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
powell in march was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 gulf war . former u.s. president george bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now vice president dick cheney , were also held responsible in the suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of israel ariel sharon .
belgium ’ s law was most famously used to initiate legal action against israeli prime minister ariel sharon for his alleged role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried by an israeli-backed christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
relations between israel and belgium have been strained since the complaint was filed . only one case has actually been tried under the belgian law .

iraqi civilians are reportedly intending to bring charges in belgium against u.s. general tommy franks for war crimes , possibly further straining ties with washington after brussels ’ opposition to the war in iraq . ten iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against u.s. general tommy franks , the commander of the u.s.-led war in iraq , the american newspaper the washington times reported . the iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of u.s. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of hillah . according to the report , brussels-based human rights lawyer jan fermon , who intends to represent the iraqis , said the complaint against franks and other u.s. military officials would be filed in a belgian court in about two weeks . " u.s. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , " fermon told the newspaper .
" a military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . " poor relations the incident could further worsen relations between washington and brussels , which vehemently opposed u.s.-led military action against iraq .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt has also annoyed u.s. officials by pushing european defense proposal seen as competing with nato . belgium 's 1993 law of universal jurisdiction allows its courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian . under widespread international pressure , the law was changed in april to give judges greater scope to reject complaints .
now the senior prosecutor may decide that cases should be referred to the country directly concerned if there is no tangible belgian link , rather than being examined in a belgian court . united states fears abuse the united states on monday welcomed the recent changes to the law , but said belgium needed to make sure its legal system was not abused . " we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends , " u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher told journalists .
" as to this specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . " u.s. secretary of state colin powell recently warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
powell in march was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 gulf war . former u.s. president george bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now vice president dick cheney , were also held responsible in the suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of israel ariel sharon .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .
" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .
" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

swiss and french prosecutors suspect bribes were paid in the takeover of leuna by france 's elf-aquitaine .
-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- the suspects , with close ties to the country 's political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds .
the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country 's foreign-policy machine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.04.2003 germany makes strides in the illegal drug fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulated clinics for heroin users has helped reduce the number of deaths german drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk announced the government 's drug overview for 2002 in berlin on tuesday .
the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .
heroin , cocaine use decreases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal drugs .
drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .
figures released last year showed the number of heroin addicts in the country to be somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 .
consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .
both groups also undergo psychological and social counseling and will also receive general medical care .
swiss success model the program is based on the successful swiss model that showed improved health in addicts involved in the project .
clinics in switzerland a noted a reduction in disease and death when addicts were provided with sanitary conditions to shoot up in .
there were also few signs that diverted heroin from the program was making it onto the black market and therefore street crime attributed to heroin was reduced .
but the successful treatment of a few addicts is a drop in the ocean compared to the continued threat to those still on the streets from cheap heroin flooding into germany through the porous border with poland and from balkan drug gangs who have established themselves in the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sealing porous borders the european project to create a single market , has dramatically altered the pattern of cross-border crime in europe .

if successful , it might save the country millions of euro in combating rampant drug abuse .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .
the biggest social injustice is the current mass unemployment , it says , and whoever blocks reforms in this sector is driving our state and society into ruin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .

authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .
" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .

iraqi civilians are reportedly intending to bring charges in belgium against u.s. general tommy franks for war crimes , possibly further straining ties with washington after brussels ’ opposition to the war in iraq . ten iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against u.s. general tommy franks , the commander of the u.s.-led war in iraq , the american newspaper the washington times reported . the iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of u.s. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of hillah . according to the report , brussels-based human rights lawyer jan fermon , who intends to represent the iraqis , said the complaint against franks and other u.s. military officials would be filed in a belgian court in about two weeks . " u.s. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , " fermon told the newspaper .
" a military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . " poor relations the incident could further worsen relations between washington and brussels , which vehemently opposed u.s.-led military action against iraq .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt has also annoyed u.s. officials by pushing european defense proposal seen as competing with nato . belgium 's 1993 law of universal jurisdiction allows its courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian . under widespread international pressure , the law was changed in april to give judges greater scope to reject complaints .
now the senior prosecutor may decide that cases should be referred to the country directly concerned if there is no tangible belgian link , rather than being examined in a belgian court . united states fears abuse the united states on monday welcomed the recent changes to the law , but said belgium needed to make sure its legal system was not abused . " we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends , " u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher told journalists .
" as to this specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . " u.s. secretary of state colin powell recently warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
powell in march was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 gulf war . former u.s. president george bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now vice president dick cheney , were also held responsible in the suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of israel ariel sharon .
belgium ’ s law was most famously used to initiate legal action against israeli prime minister ariel sharon for his alleged role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried by an israeli-backed christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
relations between israel and belgium have been strained since the complaint was filed . only one case has actually been tried under the belgian law .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium limits genocide law belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .
the biggest social injustice is the current mass unemployment , it says , and whoever blocks reforms in this sector is driving our state and society into ruin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .
" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .

drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .
figures released last year showed the number of heroin addicts in the country to be somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 .
consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .
both groups also undergo psychological and social counseling and will also receive general medical care .

there were also few signs that diverted heroin from the program was making it onto the black market and therefore street crime attributed to heroin was reduced .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .

iraqi civilians are reportedly intending to bring charges in belgium against u.s. general tommy franks for war crimes , possibly further straining ties with washington after brussels ’ opposition to the war in iraq . ten iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against u.s. general tommy franks , the commander of the u.s.-led war in iraq , the american newspaper the washington times reported . the iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of u.s. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of hillah . according to the report , brussels-based human rights lawyer jan fermon , who intends to represent the iraqis , said the complaint against franks and other u.s. military officials would be filed in a belgian court in about two weeks . " u.s. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , " fermon told the newspaper .
" a military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . " poor relations the incident could further worsen relations between washington and brussels , which vehemently opposed u.s.-led military action against iraq .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt has also annoyed u.s. officials by pushing european defense proposal seen as competing with nato . belgium 's 1993 law of universal jurisdiction allows its courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian . under widespread international pressure , the law was changed in april to give judges greater scope to reject complaints .
now the senior prosecutor may decide that cases should be referred to the country directly concerned if there is no tangible belgian link , rather than being examined in a belgian court . united states fears abuse the united states on monday welcomed the recent changes to the law , but said belgium needed to make sure its legal system was not abused . " we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends , " u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher told journalists .
" as to this specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . " u.s. secretary of state colin powell recently warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
powell in march was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 gulf war . former u.s. president george bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now vice president dick cheney , were also held responsible in the suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of israel ariel sharon .
belgium ’ s law was most famously used to initiate legal action against israeli prime minister ariel sharon for his alleged role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried by an israeli-backed christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
relations between israel and belgium have been strained since the complaint was filed . only one case has actually been tried under the belgian law .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.04.2003 germany makes strides in the illegal drug fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regulated clinics for heroin users has helped reduce the number of deaths german drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk announced the government 's drug overview for 2002 in berlin on tuesday .
the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .
heroin , cocaine use decreases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal drugs .
drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .
figures released last year showed the number of heroin addicts in the country to be somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 .
consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .
both groups also undergo psychological and social counseling and will also receive general medical care .
swiss success model the program is based on the successful swiss model that showed improved health in addicts involved in the project .
clinics in switzerland a noted a reduction in disease and death when addicts were provided with sanitary conditions to shoot up in .
there were also few signs that diverted heroin from the program was making it onto the black market and therefore street crime attributed to heroin was reduced .
but the successful treatment of a few addicts is a drop in the ocean compared to the continued threat to those still on the streets from cheap heroin flooding into germany through the porous border with poland and from balkan drug gangs who have established themselves in the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sealing porous borders the european project to create a single market , has dramatically altered the pattern of cross-border crime in europe .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .
heroin , cocaine use decreases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal drugs .
drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .
figures released last year showed the number of heroin addicts in the country to be somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 .
consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .
both groups also undergo psychological and social counseling and will also receive general medical care .
swiss success model the program is based on the successful swiss model that showed improved health in addicts involved in the project .
clinics in switzerland a noted a reduction in disease and death when addicts were provided with sanitary conditions to shoot up in .
there were also few signs that diverted heroin from the program was making it onto the black market and therefore street crime attributed to heroin was reduced .
but the successful treatment of a few addicts is a drop in the ocean compared to the continued threat to those still on the streets from cheap heroin flooding into germany through the porous border with poland and from balkan drug gangs who have established themselves in the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sealing porous borders the european project to create a single market , has dramatically altered the pattern of cross-border crime in europe .
-lrb- 12/12/2002 -rrb- hoping for a new " high " in kicking drug addiction following in the footsteps of the successful swiss experiment , germany launches its own heroin-prescription programme in bonn .
if successful , it might save the country millions of euro in combating rampant drug abuse .
-lrb- 04/03/2002 -rrb- drugs in germany – good news and bad fewer people in germany died of drug overdoses in 2001 , according to a new study on drugs and addiction , but the use of “ party drugs ” like ecstasy is on the rise .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .

iraqi civilians are reportedly intending to bring charges in belgium against u.s. general tommy franks for war crimes , possibly further straining ties with washington after brussels ’ opposition to the war in iraq . ten iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against u.s. general tommy franks , the commander of the u.s.-led war in iraq , the american newspaper the washington times reported . the iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of u.s. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of hillah . according to the report , brussels-based human rights lawyer jan fermon , who intends to represent the iraqis , said the complaint against franks and other u.s. military officials would be filed in a belgian court in about two weeks . " u.s. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , " fermon told the newspaper .
" a military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . " poor relations the incident could further worsen relations between washington and brussels , which vehemently opposed u.s.-led military action against iraq .

now the senior prosecutor may decide that cases should be referred to the country directly concerned if there is no tangible belgian link , rather than being examined in a belgian court . united states fears abuse the united states on monday welcomed the recent changes to the law , but said belgium needed to make sure its legal system was not abused . " we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends , " u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher told journalists .
" as to this specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . " u.s. secretary of state colin powell recently warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
powell in march was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 gulf war . former u.s. president george bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now vice president dick cheney , were also held responsible in the suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of israel ariel sharon .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

germany 's federal prosecutor has concluded there is no evidence that politicians here were bribed in a deal to privatize the former east german oil refinery that has figured in a scandal involving former german chancellor helmut kohl , according to a report tuesday dec .
19 , 2001 .
swiss and french prosecutors suspect bribes were paid in the takeover of leuna by france 's elf-aquitaine .
-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- the suspects , with close ties to the country 's political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds .
the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country 's foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and controlled by the state . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elf corruption trial reaches french courts the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .
the biggest social injustice is the current mass unemployment , it says , and whoever blocks reforms in this sector is driving our state and society into ruin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .
heroin , cocaine use decreases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal drugs .
drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .
figures released last year showed the number of heroin addicts in the country to be somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 .
consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .
both groups also undergo psychological and social counseling and will also receive general medical care .
swiss success model the program is based on the successful swiss model that showed improved health in addicts involved in the project .
clinics in switzerland a noted a reduction in disease and death when addicts were provided with sanitary conditions to shoot up in .
there were also few signs that diverted heroin from the program was making it onto the black market and therefore street crime attributed to heroin was reduced .
but the successful treatment of a few addicts is a drop in the ocean compared to the continued threat to those still on the streets from cheap heroin flooding into germany through the porous border with poland and from balkan drug gangs who have established themselves in the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sealing porous borders the european project to create a single market , has dramatically altered the pattern of cross-border crime in europe .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .
heroin , cocaine use decreases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal drugs .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .
" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2003 " anti-war " summit backs stronger euro military großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder has backed away from some of belgian prime minister verhofstadt 's proposals .
european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .

iraqi civilians are reportedly intending to bring charges in belgium against u.s. general tommy franks for war crimes , possibly further straining ties with washington after brussels ’ opposition to the war in iraq . ten iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against u.s. general tommy franks , the commander of the u.s.-led war in iraq , the american newspaper the washington times reported . the iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of u.s. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of hillah . according to the report , brussels-based human rights lawyer jan fermon , who intends to represent the iraqis , said the complaint against franks and other u.s. military officials would be filed in a belgian court in about two weeks . " u.s. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , " fermon told the newspaper .
" a military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . " poor relations the incident could further worsen relations between washington and brussels , which vehemently opposed u.s.-led military action against iraq .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt has also annoyed u.s. officials by pushing european defense proposal seen as competing with nato . belgium 's 1993 law of universal jurisdiction allows its courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian . under widespread international pressure , the law was changed in april to give judges greater scope to reject complaints .
now the senior prosecutor may decide that cases should be referred to the country directly concerned if there is no tangible belgian link , rather than being examined in a belgian court . united states fears abuse the united states on monday welcomed the recent changes to the law , but said belgium needed to make sure its legal system was not abused . " we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends , " u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher told journalists .
" as to this specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . " u.s. secretary of state colin powell recently warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
powell in march was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 gulf war . former u.s. president george bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now vice president dick cheney , were also held responsible in the suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of israel ariel sharon .
belgium ’ s law was most famously used to initiate legal action against israeli prime minister ariel sharon for his alleged role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried by an israeli-backed christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
relations between israel and belgium have been strained since the complaint was filed . only one case has actually been tried under the belgian law .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium limits genocide law belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .
" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .

more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .

consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .

iraqi civilians are reportedly intending to bring charges in belgium against u.s. general tommy franks for war crimes , possibly further straining ties with washington after brussels ’ opposition to the war in iraq . ten iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against u.s. general tommy franks , the commander of the u.s.-led war in iraq , the american newspaper the washington times reported . the iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of u.s. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of hillah . according to the report , brussels-based human rights lawyer jan fermon , who intends to represent the iraqis , said the complaint against franks and other u.s. military officials would be filed in a belgian court in about two weeks . " u.s. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , " fermon told the newspaper .
" a military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . " poor relations the incident could further worsen relations between washington and brussels , which vehemently opposed u.s.-led military action against iraq .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt has also annoyed u.s. officials by pushing european defense proposal seen as competing with nato . belgium 's 1993 law of universal jurisdiction allows its courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian . under widespread international pressure , the law was changed in april to give judges greater scope to reject complaints .
now the senior prosecutor may decide that cases should be referred to the country directly concerned if there is no tangible belgian link , rather than being examined in a belgian court . united states fears abuse the united states on monday welcomed the recent changes to the law , but said belgium needed to make sure its legal system was not abused . " we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends , " u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher told journalists .
" as to this specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . " u.s. secretary of state colin powell recently warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
powell in march was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 gulf war . former u.s. president george bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now vice president dick cheney , were also held responsible in the suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of israel ariel sharon .
belgium ’ s law was most famously used to initiate legal action against israeli prime minister ariel sharon for his alleged role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried by an israeli-backed christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
relations between israel and belgium have been strained since the complaint was filed . only one case has actually been tried under the belgian law .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium limits genocide law belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2003 elf trial offers soap opera of french elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl visits leuna , the german oil refinery that served as stage for one of france 's biggest-ever scandals .
with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

germany 's federal prosecutor has concluded there is no evidence that politicians here were bribed in a deal to privatize the former east german oil refinery that has figured in a scandal involving former german chancellor helmut kohl , according to a report tuesday dec .
19 , 2001 .
swiss and french prosecutors suspect bribes were paid in the takeover of leuna by france 's elf-aquitaine .
-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- the suspects , with close ties to the country 's political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds .
the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country 's foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and controlled by the state . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elf corruption trial reaches french courts the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .

drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .

consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .
heroin , cocaine use decreases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal drugs .
drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .
figures released last year showed the number of heroin addicts in the country to be somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 .
consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .
both groups also undergo psychological and social counseling and will also receive general medical care .
swiss success model the program is based on the successful swiss model that showed improved health in addicts involved in the project .
clinics in switzerland a noted a reduction in disease and death when addicts were provided with sanitary conditions to shoot up in .
there were also few signs that diverted heroin from the program was making it onto the black market and therefore street crime attributed to heroin was reduced .
but the successful treatment of a few addicts is a drop in the ocean compared to the continued threat to those still on the streets from cheap heroin flooding into germany through the porous border with poland and from balkan drug gangs who have established themselves in the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sealing porous borders the european project to create a single market , has dramatically altered the pattern of cross-border crime in europe .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .
but eu countries that backed the u.s. over iraq , including britain , spain and italy , were not invited .
verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .
in particular , france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , turned into reluctant supporters of the event . even though the four leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transatlantic partnership in their joint communique , nato still expressed misgivings over the summit 's proposals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the north atlantic treaty organization .
" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .
the biggest social injustice is the current mass unemployment , it says , and whoever blocks reforms in this sector is driving our state and society into ruin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .
the paper thinks these reasons should have been simple enough to convey - after all , it 's really all about saving the welfare state .
without fundamental reforms , the system is in danger of disappearing altogether .
berlin 's left-leaning taz offers a different solution : reintroduce property taxes in germany , which were dropped in 1996 .
that move bring in nearly one and a half times as much as the proposed cuts in unemployment benefit .
meanwhile , munich 's conservative abendzeitung attacks what it sees as the kind of over-generous socialism that takes from the rich to give to the poor .
the biggest social injustice is the current mass unemployment , it says , and whoever blocks reforms in this sector is driving our state and society into ruin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals .

verhofstadt said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war . though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s strongest military power alongside france . instead , the leaders proposed the creation of a european security and defense union within the eu , open to all member states that wished to cooperate more closely in the military field and be bound by a mutual defense commitment . they also outlined seven measures , most of which are already either under way or approved , including the creation of a european rapid reaction force , a european strategic air transport command and fleet , a joint eu nuclear , biological and chemical weapons protection capability and joint training exercises . " with a view to improving command and control capabilities available to the european union as well as to nato , our four defense ministers will take the necessary steps to establish , not later than 2004 , a multinational deployable force headquarters for joint operations , " the leaders said in statement . the summit ’ s original aim had been to beef up eu defense , giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the united states . weakened by u.s. victory but the swift american victory in iraq sapped the meeting of much up its verve .

" we are concerned about how extra capabilities will be delivered without extra resources , and we are also concerned about the risk of unnecessary duplication , " nato spokesman yves brodeur said in a statement . schröder on tuesday also came under renewed attack from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said the summit serves only to exacerbate existing divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq . “ it ’ s the wrong initiative at the wrong time because it ’ s more likely to split europe and it ’ s more likely to split nato , ” wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats , told zdf television . dw with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance . france , germany , belgium and luxembourg also said they would develop a european rapid reaction force that would be open to other european union member states .
a franco-german brigade is expected to form the core of the new force . the mini-summit - attended only by nations that opposed the u.s.-led military action in iraq - had come under fierce criticism for re-opening the internal rift in the european union over the war . belgium had originally proposed the idea of setting up a european military headquarters separate from nato .
but french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , keen to repair strained ties with washington over iraq , distanced themselves from those proposals . " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe , and that is what we want to change with the proposals we have made , " schröder told a press conference after the two-hour meeting . belgium to blame belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt organized the summit to discuss european defense integration at the beginning of the war in iraq .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .
despite , the escalation of " recreational " drugs in germany , the 2002 overview continues to show that new levels of general health awareness and increased medical help and support in germany are beginning to win minor battles in the war on drugs .
but it also highlights the extent of the problem the authorities continue to face .
heroin , cocaine use decreases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal drugs .
drug consumption in germany has remained alarmingly high despite measures aimed at cutting the numbers of addicts .
figures released last year showed the number of heroin addicts in the country to be somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 .
consumption of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine fell slightly in 2001 and the hallucinogenic drug lsd also showed signs of losing popularity amongst users .
last year the german government opened an emergency unit in bonn for heroin addicts , where regulated and legal doses of heroin could be administered to hard-core addicts .
the bonn clinic treats over 100 addicts , half receiving pure heroin , the other half the substitute drug methadone .
both groups also undergo psychological and social counseling and will also receive general medical care .

clinics in switzerland a noted a reduction in disease and death when addicts were provided with sanitary conditions to shoot up in .
there were also few signs that diverted heroin from the program was making it onto the black market and therefore street crime attributed to heroin was reduced .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased . it is debatable whether any report on the death toll from substance abuse can be described as good news .
but the german government 's 2002 annual drug overview , usually an unbroken list of sobering statistics , showed signs that concerted government efforts to contain the spread of hard drugs and their effects were helping to reduce casualties .
in total , the number of drug deaths in germany fell 17.5 percent in 2002 , with 1,513 reported fatalities .
this marks a continued decline that follows on from the 9.6 percent drop in 2001 .
the report showed that more people fell victim to their addiction in west german regions than in the east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal drugs .
more socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol and tobacco continue to be the big killers in germany . more than 40,000 people died from alcohol-related problems in 2002 with 110,000 of germany 's 16.7 million smokers dying from diseases arising from their habit .
young people continue to be most at risk from both .
" alcohol abuse is still trivialized in our society , " said marion caspers-merk , the government 's drug czar .
" its consequences , along with smoking , are underestimated and played down . "
club drugs continue to be popular the report did carry some positive news regarding " hard " drugs with more users now perceiving the potentially lethal drug heroin as unpopular within the drug scene .
however , the preference for synthetic substances , like the club drug ecstasy , was on the rise .
this is a worrying trend that was highlighted in the full year report for 2001 .
the number of people who took ecstasy rose 11 percent in that year , according to police reports , and it was estimated at the time that three to four percent of young people in germany were consuming " designer " drugs or other amphetamines .

with a cast of characters including a former prime minister , some of the richest executives in france and germany , paris ' biggest-ever corporate crime trial continued this week with 37 defendants in the dock . france 's largest-ever corporate corruption trial resumed in paris this week with more drama than your average mexican soap opera .
the case offered further tales of illicit backroom dealing , a € 5 million divorce settlement tab picked up by french taxpayers and allegations that a former french prime minister accepted bribes in connection with a string of acquisitions made by the state-owned french oil conglomerate elf aquitane in the ' 80s and ' 90s .
some of the case 's most piquant charges relate to the sale of the formerly state-owned leuna oil refinery in eastern germany to elf acquitane in 1992 .
elf executives stand accused of offering payoffs and bribes to leading german politicians .
ministers and a prime minister former elf general affairs manager alfred sirven , a key defendant in the case , told the court on monday the company paid off two former german minister-level officials as well as a company owned by former french prime minister edith cresson in order to help secure the purchase of the refinery in 1992 .
that year , elf purchased both the refinery in the state of saxony-anhalt as well as the minol gas station chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a march 4 , 1996 file photo of loik le floch-prigent , president and general manager of the french national railroad -lrb- sncf -rrb- who was placed under formal investigation late thursday july 4 , 1996 for fraud and receiving stolen assets .
authorities announced friday july 5 that le floch-prigent was arrested on charges that he misused funds while he headed the state-owned oil company elf .
-lrb- ap photo / lionel cironneau / fls -rrb- sirven has accused loik le floch-prigen -lrb- photo -rrb- , the former head of elf aquitaine , of ordering him to pay bribes to companies and politicians throughout the 1980s and 1990s .
" i paid german personalities and french ones too , and i was acting on the instructions of loik le floch-prigent .
there were two former german ministers and the company sisie -lrb- owned by cresson -rrb- . "
a well-oiled bribery machine judges hearing the case allege that elf executives paid close to 270 million francs -lrb- € 41.16 million -rrb- in order to secure the purchase of the refinery and service stations .
if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

if the case can be proven , it will be the largest case of documented corporate corruption in french history .
during his testimony on monday , le floch-prigen said elf aquitaine fell into a difficult period at the time of the leuna acquisition .
business took a turn for the worse when shell suddenly pulled out of the deal one month before it was suppose to close .
at the time , german engineering giant thyssen was also threatening to pull out .
but by that time , negotiations had gone so far that it would have been impossible for elf aquitaine to abandon the acquisition without broad and negative repercussions for french-german relations , le floch-prigen said .
political influence , he concluded , was the company 's best chance for saving the complicated deal .
for that reason he approved the funding of politicians as well as secret payments to german and french intelligence agents in order to secure the purchase - a move he said he made on the advice of sirvan .
the lobbyist and the spy le floch-prigent has lobbed a number of serious accusations at his former business manager , and this time , as with the others , sirvan has vehemently denied them .
sirven said he never discussed funneling money to intelligence agencies .
he claimed having hired two " middlemen " including german lobbyist dieter holzer and former french secret agent pierre lethier . after hiding out in switzerland and britain , lethier - who worked as a secret agent for france 's dgse agency between 1979 and 1997 - turned himself over to the french authorities last week .
sirven said holzer and lethier had been given approximately € 40 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- to arrange the deal in leuna .
he alleges they funneled part of the money on to others , including the two german ministers , whom he sirven has refused to identify but has said received " considerable sums . "
however , holzer has consistently denied claims that some of the money went to the christian democratic union , the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl .
le floch-prigent told the court he was unaware of where the money directed to holzer and lethier ultimately landed , but he admitted that he had approved the use of lobbyists .
the reason : elf had previously sought to launch a project in eastern germany without the help of lobbyists and the initiative failed .
le floch-pringent also leveled another political grenade at the courtroom on tuesday , admitting that he had used elf funds - and , indirectly , taxpayer money - to pay a divorce settlement with his wife , who he feared would go public with embarrassing revelations about the company .
le floch-pringent even offered his resignation to then-french president francois mitterand over the divorce , but mitterand refused , simply telling him to deal with the problem .
le floch-pringent took the former president 's words as a license to pay off his wife , fatima belaid .
his 18-month love affair with belaid , le floch-pringent told the court , had turned into a " nightmare " with " psychological harassment that was incompatible with the role of company chairman . "
a case reaching from germany to africa there are 37 defendants in the trial , which has implicated a broad range of leading politicians and parties - including french president jacques chirac 's former rally for the republic party and the party of then-german chancellor helmut kohl , the christian democratic union , in the corruption scandal .

germany 's federal prosecutor has concluded there is no evidence that politicians here were bribed in a deal to privatize the former east german oil refinery that has figured in a scandal involving former german chancellor helmut kohl , according to a report tuesday dec .
19 , 2001 .
swiss and french prosecutors suspect bribes were paid in the takeover of leuna by france 's elf-aquitaine .
-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- the suspects , with close ties to the country 's political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds .
the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country 's foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and controlled by the state . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de elf corruption trial reaches french courts the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine .

gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan . one thing chancellor gerhard schröder is right about is that his position is at stake .
if he ca n't even get his own party to back him on difficult reforms in germany 's social system and labor market to spur economic growth , then he must go - along with the social democrats and greens who share power in parliament .
that 's the opinion of the conservative berlin daily die welt .
the paper sees schröder 's " agenda 2010 " as a step in the right direction , but comments that given the scale of germany 's problems , he 's just tinkering and not offering any real solutions .
the plan includes cuts in jobless benefits and measures that will make it easier to fire employees .
the social democratic party executive approved the plan by 28 votes to four , with four abstentions .
it now faces a vote before the entire social democratic party .
schröder made it clear on monday that the vote was about more than the reforms - it was about power , his leadership and his ability to govern , writes the stuttgarter zeitung .
the chancellor put a gun to the head of his party , writes cologne 's express .
the paper also asked : what 's a decision worth that 's made under that kind of pressure ?
it 's not going to convince the critics to abandon their criticism .
then again , according to the frankfurter neue presse , preparing the ground so a decision becomes a logical conclusion is not schröder 's forte .
the paper accuses him of dodging serious debate on the future of the german welfare state .
he ca n't govern without continually resorting to votes of confidence , it writes .
and anyone who has to keep falling back on the weight of his own authority in order to get people to do what he wants is not a good boss .
others see the vote less negatively .
the financial times deutschland 's editors believe the strategy will work for schröder .
the left wing of his party is too weak to oppose him , and they have n't got any alternatives of their own to present .
but the paper also concludes that the chancellor has succeeded only in silencing his critics , not convincing them , and it adds that he 's also failed to convince the public .
instead of presenting the arguments in favor of agenda 2010 , it writes , he 's fobbed people off by insisting that there is no other way .
they 're still in the dark as to the reasons why these reforms are necessary .

school admission policies can cause real problems for parents trying to find a place in a school for their child .
many consider factors like whether the applicant has a sibling already in the school , while some schools go by how close the family lives to the school .
all this week breakfast will be looking at some of the problems facing parents and children when it comes to getting the best school and ultimately the best education .
today we reported on the case of 11 year old joel ansell-fraser from south london , who has applied to four schools without success .
and at 0845 the head teacher of a school in wimbledon - angeles malden - told us what it 's like to deal with the problem of allocating places .
jules botfield reported from lewisham , where there 's a campaign to build a new school .
jules botfield reports from the school gate one of the campaigners was elected to the council on this issue in an attempt to get the new school built .
councillor helen le fevre said that it 's children who are n't being listened to - they want to go to a local school - that 's their top priority .
but katy donnelly from the council 's education committee said that the council would be opening a new school in the borough to offer education closer to where children live .
and on the issue of parental choice - parents wanting to send their children to good schools - she said that a school 's reputation often lagged behind improvements that had been made .
click here to see jules botfield 's report if you want more information on schools in england and scotland , click on the link below .
we do n't have information on wales and northern ireland as they do not produce league tables .
click here for school league tables having brothers or sisters already in a chosen school can be a major factor in allocating another school place , as can how close the family lives to a school .
some schools allocate places on the first criterion and others on the second .
one gloucestershire mum has fallen foul of the system and now has to face a daily nightmare school run .
nicki clayton ca n't get her three children into the same school .
the school her first two children goes to in south gloucestershire has a strict admissions policy that considers proximity in favour of whether the child has brothers or sisters in the school .
when she moved slightly further away from the school , it took her just outside the catchment area by a third of a mile and now nicki ca n't get her third child into the same school , giving her a nightmare school run .
the policy changed after she had moved , and her attempt to appeal against the decision failed .

the proposed reforms would extend background checks and bring all workers under the same umbrella .
the new guidelines would affect about 20,000 volunteers who work for the church .
they include sunday school helpers , boys brigade officers and girl guide officers .
records would be updated as individuals moved between activities in their church and transferred between congregations .
the kirk 's general assembly will consider a report by the board of practice and procedure next month outlining the proposals .
new system iain whyte , director and general secretary , said : " up until now we have relied on reference and interviews .
" last year we agreed that when criminal records could be checked we would use them for new volunteers .
" the report outlines how the new system will work . "
the report says that all church co-ordinators must be trained in operating the system .
it also warns that volunteers must not work with children prior to being tested by the child protection unit .
presbyteries should monitor compliance through an annual inspection of congregational records , it is recommended .

a new control room in exeter has opened and the number of cameras expanded to more than 80 around the city centre .
there will be a further 130 when the multi-million-pound revamp of the princesshay shopping centre gets under way .
john reynolds , manager of debenhams and former chairman of the city centre consortium , said : " it makes a difference and encourages customers to come into the city in a secure and pleasant environment . "
the growth of cctv 1990 - three town centre schemes with 100 cameras 1994 - 16 town centre schemes with 400 cameras 1994 - 1997 home office gives £ 38m to fund 585 cctv schemes 1997 - 167 schemes with more than 5,200 cameras 1996 - 1998 cctv accounts for more than three-quarters of total crime prevention spending 1999 - 2003 £ 170m made available for cctv the home office has paid £ 480,000 and the rest of the cash has come from local authorities , businesses , exeter university and the city 's hospitals .
the exact location of the exeter city council-operated control room is being kept secret for security reasons .
cctv services in exeter , introduced in 1996 , were previously co-ordinated from devon county council 's control room at county hall .
a home office-commissioned report last year suggested that cctv was not as useful in the fight against crime as was previously thought .
the report - which looked at evaluations of 22 cctv schemes in britain and the us - found that while cameras could have a marked effect on reducing vehicle crime , there was little evidence they prevented violent crime .

a home office-commissioned report last year suggested that cctv was not as useful in the fight against crime as was previously thought .
the report - which looked at evaluations of 22 cctv schemes in britain and the us - found that while cameras could have a marked effect on reducing vehicle crime , there was little evidence they prevented violent crime .

previous estimates of slight growth have proved over-optimistic , with the latest statistics showing the economy contracted by 0.1 % during the three month period .
the bad news about the state of the french economy , the second largest in the eurozone , coincides with equally gloomy data about business morale .
french business sentiment slumped for the second consecutive month in april as the iraq war hit confidence , according to official figures .
french economic growth q1 2002 : + 0.7 % q2 2002 : + 0.5 % q3 2002 : + 0.3 % q4 2002 : -0.1 % businesses have also been unsettled by publicity campaigns urging us consumers to boycott french products , including high-profile exports like wine and cheese .
despite the clutch of worrying statistics , the french economy is still predicted to grow by 1.2 % this year .
the latest raft of figures also confirm that the public deficit rose to 3.1 % of gross domestic product in 2002 , more than double that of the previous year and in breach of eu rules .
french budget deficit 2000:1.4 % 2001:1.5 % 2002:3.1 % forecast for 2003:3.7 % the 12 members of the eurozone are required to keep their budget deficits to below 3 % of gdp in order to ensure stability .
earlier this month , the european commission criticised paris for not taking adequate steps to reduce its deficit , and warned that it could rise to 3.7 % of gdp this year .
it is the first time that official figures have confirmed that france has broken the rules .
analysts thought the bad news from france , together with a weak survey on business confidence from germany on monday , would encourage the european central bank to cut interest rates later this month .
