it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .

“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .

“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .
for now , " tannenzäpfle " of baden is the exotic beer of choice in german hostels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

friday morning 's earthquake , which registered 6.3 on the richter scale , literally flattened the city of bam , which has a population of 100,000 and is located on the country ’ s ancient silk road .
german disaster workers save 20 iranian state news agency irna has reported that aid workers from germany ’ s federal disaster relief agency , thw , have already rescued 20 people using search and rescue dogs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thw workers and search dog a spokesman for the technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- said that about 50 german experts are now in iran aiding with rescue work .
the team is equipped with tracking dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other tools they need to locate survivors amid the rubble .
the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .
generally , people buried in earthquakes can ’ t survive longer than 72 hours , meaning the chances of finding more people after monday morning would be very low .
but relief workers haven ’ t given up yet .
" this is really about giving people hope and offering our support , " said nicolas hefner , a thw spokesman .
an international effort members of thw ’ s rapid deployment unit search and rescue team -lrb- seeba -rrb- landed on saturday at kerman , a city about 300 kilometers from the quake ’ s epicenter in bam .
they were subsequently transported by iranian military craft to the catastrophe area .
in addition to thw , the plane also carried members of the german red cross , the workers ' samaritan federation , malteser hilfsdienst -lrb- the ambulance corps of the order of malta -rrb- and the association of german rescue dogs , who are joining in the rescue and relief efforts .
aid workers and planes from russia and britain have also arrived in kerman .
there , they join relief workers from switzerland , france and other european union nations as well as china .

though neither organization has provided an estimate of the damage caused by the earthquake , officials in geneva said long-term relief would be required as the city is rebuilt and tens of thousands are provided with medical care .

but hopes for finding people alive beneath the rubble has become a race against the clock . rescue workers from around the world on sunday continued sifting through the debris from one of the worst earthquakes iran has ever seen .
but in the days following friday ’ s earthquake , hopes are sinking that many more survivors will be found .
now , what began as a search and rescue operation has become a search and retrieve job – with the bodies of entire families being pulled out of the rubble .
initially , the death toll was estimated at 30,000 or more , but overnight , the governor of the kerman province provided a lower but nonetheless staggering figure .
" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2003 serbs head to polls in tense elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly man casts his ballot at a polling station in belgrade serbs headed for their local polling stations on sunday to participate in parliamentary elections , where suspected war criminals and nationalists are expected to give moderates a serious challenge . for close to a year now , serbia has stumbled from one crisis to the next .
it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "

on saturday , police arrested the 65-year-old company founder and former president as he walked down the street .
according to media reports , tanzi is being question based on suspicions by prosecutors that he wired as much of € 7 billion of the firm ’ s money into private accounts .

just hours before tanzi ’ s arrest and three days after the company filed for bankruptcy , a court in parma , where the company has its headquarters , officially declared parmalat ’ s insolvency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2003 serbs head to polls in tense elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly man casts his ballot at a polling station in belgrade serbs headed for their local polling stations on sunday to participate in parliamentary elections , where suspected war criminals and nationalists are expected to give moderates a serious challenge . for close to a year now , serbia has stumbled from one crisis to the next .
it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2003 serbs head to polls in tense elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly man casts his ballot at a polling station in belgrade serbs headed for their local polling stations on sunday to participate in parliamentary elections , where suspected war criminals and nationalists are expected to give moderates a serious challenge . for close to a year now , serbia has stumbled from one crisis to the next .
it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2003 serbs head to polls in tense elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly man casts his ballot at a polling station in belgrade serbs headed for their local polling stations on sunday to participate in parliamentary elections , where suspected war criminals and nationalists are expected to give moderates a serious challenge . for close to a year now , serbia has stumbled from one crisis to the next .
it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .

but hopes for finding people alive beneath the rubble has become a race against the clock . rescue workers from around the world on sunday continued sifting through the debris from one of the worst earthquakes iran has ever seen .
but in the days following friday ’ s earthquake , hopes are sinking that many more survivors will be found .
now , what began as a search and rescue operation has become a search and retrieve job – with the bodies of entire families being pulled out of the rubble .
initially , the death toll was estimated at 30,000 or more , but overnight , the governor of the kerman province provided a lower but nonetheless staggering figure .
" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .
iranian president mohammad khatami has described the earthquake as a " national tragedy . "
by sunday afternoon , however , the iranian interior ministry said the number of casualties was expected to grow to at least 20,000 .

the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .
generally , people buried in earthquakes can ’ t survive longer than 72 hours , meaning the chances of finding more people after monday morning would be very low .
but relief workers haven ’ t given up yet .
" this is really about giving people hope and offering our support , " said nicolas hefner , a thw spokesman .
an international effort members of thw ’ s rapid deployment unit search and rescue team -lrb- seeba -rrb- landed on saturday at kerman , a city about 300 kilometers from the quake ’ s epicenter in bam .

aid workers and planes from russia and britain have also arrived in kerman .

though neither organization has provided an estimate of the damage caused by the earthquake , officials in geneva said long-term relief would be required as the city is rebuilt and tens of thousands are provided with medical care .

but in the days following friday ’ s earthquake , hopes are sinking that many more survivors will be found .
now , what began as a search and rescue operation has become a search and retrieve job – with the bodies of entire families being pulled out of the rubble .
initially , the death toll was estimated at 30,000 or more , but overnight , the governor of the kerman province provided a lower but nonetheless staggering figure .
" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .
iranian president mohammad khatami has described the earthquake as a " national tragedy . "

the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .
generally , people buried in earthquakes can ’ t survive longer than 72 hours , meaning the chances of finding more people after monday morning would be very low .
but relief workers haven ’ t given up yet .

they were subsequently transported by iranian military craft to the catastrophe area .

aid workers and planes from russia and britain have also arrived in kerman .

police in milan on saturday arrested the founder of insolvent italian food giant parmalat on suspicion of fraud .
the company is at the center of one of the biggest accounting scandal ’ s in european history . calisto tanzi is an italian self-made man .
he transformed a small milk company into one of the largest food conglomerates in the world .
but this week , parmalat ’ s fabled history crashed as information became public that the company had been responsible for one of the worst cases of corporate accounting fraud ever perpetrated in europe .
on saturday , police arrested the 65-year-old company founder and former president as he walked down the street .
according to media reports , tanzi is being question based on suspicions by prosecutors that he wired as much of € 7 billion of the firm ’ s money into private accounts .
judicial sources told the reuters news agency tanzi was suspected of committing market rigging and false auditing .
without a trace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanzi resigned from his post at the firm in mid-december , after the first evidence emerged that the company , famous for its dairy products , was in deep financial trouble .
the previous week , it was discovered that several billions of euros were missing from parmalat ’ s balance sheet .
the money is still missing and prosecutors are accusing the company ’ s executives of having committed fraud and falsifying its balance sheet .
just hours before tanzi ’ s arrest and three days after the company filed for bankruptcy , a court in parma , where the company has its headquarters , officially declared parmalat ’ s insolvency .
the ruling came , as expected , after insolvency administrator enrico bondi presented a report on the company ’ s deeply troubling financial condition .

many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .

many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .

it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2003 black forest brewery bucks the downward trend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rothaus brewery 's location is hardly one that conjures up the cut and thrust image of business .
many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .
for now , " tannenzäpfle " of baden is the exotic beer of choice in german hostels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.12.2003 serbs head to polls in tense elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly man casts his ballot at a polling station in belgrade serbs headed for their local polling stations on sunday to participate in parliamentary elections , where suspected war criminals and nationalists are expected to give moderates a serious challenge . for close to a year now , serbia has stumbled from one crisis to the next .
it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2003 black forest brewery bucks the downward trend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rothaus brewery 's location is hardly one that conjures up the cut and thrust image of business .
many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .
for now , " tannenzäpfle " of baden is the exotic beer of choice in german hostels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2003 black forest brewery bucks the downward trend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rothaus brewery 's location is hardly one that conjures up the cut and thrust image of business .
many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .
for now , " tannenzäpfle " of baden is the exotic beer of choice in german hostels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

but in the days following friday ’ s earthquake , hopes are sinking that many more survivors will be found .
now , what began as a search and rescue operation has become a search and retrieve job – with the bodies of entire families being pulled out of the rubble .
initially , the death toll was estimated at 30,000 or more , but overnight , the governor of the kerman province provided a lower but nonetheless staggering figure .
" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .

german disaster workers save 20 iranian state news agency irna has reported that aid workers from germany ’ s federal disaster relief agency , thw , have already rescued 20 people using search and rescue dogs .

the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .
generally , people buried in earthquakes can ’ t survive longer than 72 hours , meaning the chances of finding more people after monday morning would be very low .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2003 black forest brewery bucks the downward trend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rothaus brewery 's location is hardly one that conjures up the cut and thrust image of business .
many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .
for now , " tannenzäpfle " of baden is the exotic beer of choice in german hostels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .
iranian president mohammad khatami has described the earthquake as a " national tragedy . "

it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .

it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .

many german beer firms will look back on 2003 and want to drown their sorrows after a difficult year .
but one small southern german company will be popping corks in celebration and recording yet another year on the up . there is no doubting that 2003 has been a bad year for middle-sized enterprises in germany .
the state of the economy and the effects on consumer confidence have cut the profits of big companies and have backed smaller firms up against the wall . one sector that has particularly suffered is the german beverage industry , where consumption figures have been falling for the past few years .
however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”
u.s. trend showing in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the big breweries may be the architects of their own future problems .
a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .
the " tannenzäpfle " label uses these traditional values and stereotypes to its advantage : the rosy-cheeked “ schwarzwaldmädle ” hostess in local costume looking like she has just stepped out of an east german red riding hood illustration . the company lends itself to the ideals of the traditional brewery , another factor that endears it to the seasoned beer drinker : the brewers use traditional techniques and they work hard .
as for advertising , television spots are taboo . the image of the beer , for the time being at least , is secure with “ native country ” products continuing to be trendy in the bar scenes of hamburg , cologne and berlin .
for now , " tannenzäpfle " of baden is the exotic beer of choice in german hostels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's favorite beverage : beer from flensburg in the north to munich in the south , beer is germany ’ s favorite drink .

however , one company stands out as an example of how to cope in such difficult times . year-end celebrations at rothaus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the badische staatsbrauerei rothaus , situated in the idyllic green meadows and dark fir forests of baden in the black forest , may not be everyone ’ s idea of a cut-and-thrust enterprise , but the makers of " tannenzäpfle " beer have made such progress this year that they gave their employees a bonus of three months pay . so how are the clever brewers managing to drive their company fortunes up at a time when many of their counterparts are heading downhill ? turnover continues to increase it could be that , even in an economically stunted environment , people will buy the products they like .
and " tannenzäpfle " is very popular .
thirty or forty lorries , each carrying a load of 30,720 bottles of the speciality pils beer , leave the small brewery every day destined for bars and shops across germany .
despite the fact that the rothaus brew is expensive in comparison to the products of other locally owned breweries , the company turnover grows about five to nine percent every year with net sales of 28 percent . “ these are very rough times for the breweries , ” said one employee at the rothaus brewery in an interview with dw-world .
“ for the past ten or twelve years , many have had to live with losses , year in and year out .
for a company in this sector to not only be a success but to double its profits , that doesn ’ t happen on its own . ”

a spokesperson at the german brewer ’ s association told dw-world that a trend similar to one in the united states could be the reason behind the rising popularity of " tannenzäpfle " .
“ it appears that germany is heading more and more towards the situation we see in the united states , where only a few suppliers influence the beverage industry , ” said the spokesperson .
“ the bigger the corporations becomes , the more impersonal and anonymous their beverages get .
the rothaus brewery success is a sign that consumers are moving away from that and appreciating regional specialities again , ” he added .
brewery offers emotional connection “ we rely on a number of factors here , such as sympathy and identification , ” said another employee .
“ the fact that we are a small company operating from the heart of the black forest transfers to our products .
in an industry like the beer market , which is saturated with brands , you must offer more than the primary need to extinguish thirst .
an emotional connection needs to be made so the consumer says , ‘ i buy the beer because i associate certain values with it . ’ ” the black forest location of the rothaus brewery conjures up the perfect imaginary vista for the beer drinker : the wide open countryside , green and fresh on warm summer days , log cabins and woolly sweaters in winter . sterotypes used in beer 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally dressed waitresses at oktoberfest .

but hopes for finding people alive beneath the rubble has become a race against the clock . rescue workers from around the world on sunday continued sifting through the debris from one of the worst earthquakes iran has ever seen .
but in the days following friday ’ s earthquake , hopes are sinking that many more survivors will be found .
now , what began as a search and rescue operation has become a search and retrieve job – with the bodies of entire families being pulled out of the rubble .
initially , the death toll was estimated at 30,000 or more , but overnight , the governor of the kerman province provided a lower but nonetheless staggering figure .
" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .
iranian president mohammad khatami has described the earthquake as a " national tragedy . "
by sunday afternoon , however , the iranian interior ministry said the number of casualties was expected to grow to at least 20,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are being buried in mass graves in bam .
friday morning 's earthquake , which registered 6.3 on the richter scale , literally flattened the city of bam , which has a population of 100,000 and is located on the country ’ s ancient silk road .
german disaster workers save 20 iranian state news agency irna has reported that aid workers from germany ’ s federal disaster relief agency , thw , have already rescued 20 people using search and rescue dogs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thw workers and search dog a spokesman for the technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- said that about 50 german experts are now in iran aiding with rescue work .
the team is equipped with tracking dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other tools they need to locate survivors amid the rubble .
the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .
generally , people buried in earthquakes can ’ t survive longer than 72 hours , meaning the chances of finding more people after monday morning would be very low .
but relief workers haven ’ t given up yet .
" this is really about giving people hope and offering our support , " said nicolas hefner , a thw spokesman .
an international effort members of thw ’ s rapid deployment unit search and rescue team -lrb- seeba -rrb- landed on saturday at kerman , a city about 300 kilometers from the quake ’ s epicenter in bam .
they were subsequently transported by iranian military craft to the catastrophe area .
in addition to thw , the plane also carried members of the german red cross , the workers ' samaritan federation , malteser hilfsdienst -lrb- the ambulance corps of the order of malta -rrb- and the association of german rescue dogs , who are joining in the rescue and relief efforts .
aid workers and planes from russia and britain have also arrived in kerman .
there , they join relief workers from switzerland , france and other european union nations as well as china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international federation of red cross and red crescent logo , graphic element on white 1998/2 / 8 at the request of the iranian government , the international red cross and its sister organization red crescent are also delivering 20,000 tens , 200,000 blankets , 30 power generators and 20,000 kerosene heaters .
though neither organization has provided an estimate of the damage caused by the earthquake , officials in geneva said long-term relief would be required as the city is rebuilt and tens of thousands are provided with medical care .
help from brussels the european union has also increased pledge of earthquake relief to iran from € 800,000 to € 2.3 million .
a spokesperson for the european commission said the money would be used for search and rescue teams , for medical care as well as providing shelter , water and heat for the tens of thousands of homeless in the region .
italy , currently the rotating president of the eu , has take over responsibility for coordinating european relief efforts in iran .
the eu has also said it will consider making additional funds available .
meanwhile , the iranians have also set aside their political differences with the united states and are allowing american relief workers to enter the country with simplified visa procedures .

it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .

it began with the transformation of yugoslavia to a loose alliance between serbia and montenegro .
the questions of the relationship between those two republics as well as the status of the province of kosovo , which has been under un administration since the nato air strikes in 1999 , continued to simmer in the background .
then , in march , the reform movement ’ s leading figure , zoran djindjic , was assassinated by mafia kingpins in belgrade .
trouble had been stirring even before djindjic ’ s death .
two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .

two major parties in the government – the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- and the g17 plus party both left the governing coalition of the serbian democratic opposition -lrb- dos -rrb- .
djindjic ’ s own democratic party -lrb- ds -rrb- remained the only strong member of the ruling coalition .
but within six months of djindjic ’ s death , the incumbent coalition became marred by internal fighting and serious accusations of corruption and abuse of power .
a republic without a leader meanwhile , there is still no head of state in place in serbia because three presidential election attempts in the republic have failed to draw enough voters to create a valid result .
the government has been plagued by numerous resignations and firings that have left , in many areas , what could best be described as " emergency staffing . "
and after a short economic recovery , there are now fears serbia could fall into recession .
under growing public pressure , the government coalition called for new elections , almost exactly three years after dos forced milosevic out of power .
the democratic party ’ s main candidate is boris tadic , who currently serves as serbia ’ s defense minister .
rather than distancing himself from the infighting within his party , he has made concrete changes to it – successfully ordering the removal of high-ranking ds members with dubious mafia connections from the ballot .
but he hasn ’ t taken steps yet to stop the party ’ s fighting – instead he has apologized to voters and said he would address the problems after the election .
he has also said he will refuse to become part of a coalition with three parties .
" today we need a government with fewer parties , " he recently said .
" these parties have to make fundamental order in government ’ s work possible and they have to be able to find unity in basic policy areas .
the first question for most serbs is jobs .
order is a prerequisite for jobs .
the safety of our citizens is the third question .
those are basic questions that serbs have to deal with . "
dss , g17 and ds ?
but the dss and g17 parties are skeptical of entering into a coalition government with ds – especially dss , the party of former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
" it ’ s hard to work together with the parties that are responsible for these conditions , for the conditions before 2000 and between 2000 and 2003 , " kostunica told deutsche welle .
" because of them , we also now have problems that affect our cooperation with the ds because between 2000 and 2003 , instead of actively working on the expansion of democratic institutions they dismantled them and , in the end , are also responsible for the rampant corruption and crime . "
still , kostunica hasn ’ t provided clear solutions to the problems .
kostunica has opposed calls by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for the extradition of suspected war criminals .
for that , he ’ s often been criticized by the european union and the united states , the most important cash donors to impoverished serbia .
for its part , the g17 party is joining the eu ’ s call for the federal alliance with the montenegro to be eliminated .
though he participated in the reform of the federation as as yugoslav vice prime minister , party leader miroljub labus is now putting the brakes on serbia ’ s path toward europe .
his position on kosovo is also controversial .
" we want to deal with the problem of kosovo independently from that of montenegro because that ’ s the desire of montenegro ’ s politicians , " labus told deutsche welle .
" we ’ re planning to create a kosovo ministry rather than the current coordination center , so that the government takes over responsibility for dialogue and kosovo policy .
but the time for new initiatives won ’ t come until after the new government has been created . "
threat of civil war ?
in the event that the province , which has a majority albanian population , declares its independence , the serbian radical party -lrb- srs -rrb- has threatened to go to war .
srs served as an important and loyal partner to milosevic during his rule in the 1990s .
in january , the party ’ s chief , vojislave seselj , surrendered to international war crimes tribunal in the hague on charges of war crimes .
despite that fact , he ’ s still his party ’ s main candidate .
" we won ’ t extradite anyone to the hague , " srs deputy leader tomislav nikolic told deutsche welle .
" srs will work with the hague tribunal to insure the legal protection of the serbs detained there .
but if the hague considers all serbs to be criminals , then all of nato ’ s soldiers and police are also criminals . "
but most observers are skeptical as to whether the ultra nationalist srs could create a working governing coalition .
still , polls show the party could win as much as 25 percent of the seats in parliament , which would give it the most votes of any party in parliament .
other parties are also seeking a piece of the pie , including the socialist party of serbia , which has named milosevic as its leading candidate with the hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in parliament .
finally , the serbian renewal movement -lrb- spo -rrb- - new serbia -lrb- ns -rrb- coalition , one of the leading opposition parties during the 1990s , also stands a chance of entering parliament .
despite the dizzying array of parties , most observers believe the conservative dss , the liberal g17 and the social democratic ds will each gain 15 to 20 percent of the vote , giving them the stable majority necessary to create a new democratic government .
the remaining parties , from a group totaling 19 , will unlikely clear the three percent minimum required to enter parliament . filip slavkovic -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de djindjic murder trial overshadows serbian elections as the trial of 36 suspects in the murder of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic continued on tuesday , serbian opposition leaders accused the government of trying to sway public opinion in sunday ’ s general election .

but in the days following friday ’ s earthquake , hopes are sinking that many more survivors will be found .
now , what began as a search and rescue operation has become a search and retrieve job – with the bodies of entire families being pulled out of the rubble .
initially , the death toll was estimated at 30,000 or more , but overnight , the governor of the kerman province provided a lower but nonetheless staggering figure .
" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .
iranian president mohammad khatami has described the earthquake as a " national tragedy . "
by sunday afternoon , however , the iranian interior ministry said the number of casualties was expected to grow to at least 20,000 .

the team is equipped with tracking dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other tools they need to locate survivors amid the rubble .
the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .
generally , people buried in earthquakes can ’ t survive longer than 72 hours , meaning the chances of finding more people after monday morning would be very low .
but relief workers haven ’ t given up yet .
" this is really about giving people hope and offering our support , " said nicolas hefner , a thw spokesman .
an international effort members of thw ’ s rapid deployment unit search and rescue team -lrb- seeba -rrb- landed on saturday at kerman , a city about 300 kilometers from the quake ’ s epicenter in bam .
they were subsequently transported by iranian military craft to the catastrophe area .
in addition to thw , the plane also carried members of the german red cross , the workers ' samaritan federation , malteser hilfsdienst -lrb- the ambulance corps of the order of malta -rrb- and the association of german rescue dogs , who are joining in the rescue and relief efforts .
aid workers and planes from russia and britain have also arrived in kerman .

but hopes for finding people alive beneath the rubble has become a race against the clock . rescue workers from around the world on sunday continued sifting through the debris from one of the worst earthquakes iran has ever seen .
but in the days following friday ’ s earthquake , hopes are sinking that many more survivors will be found .
now , what began as a search and rescue operation has become a search and retrieve job – with the bodies of entire families being pulled out of the rubble .
initially , the death toll was estimated at 30,000 or more , but overnight , the governor of the kerman province provided a lower but nonetheless staggering figure .
" we ’ re assuming that the quake in bam took 5,000 to 10,000 human lives , " mohammad ali karimi told reporters .
iranian president mohammad khatami has described the earthquake as a " national tragedy . "
by sunday afternoon , however , the iranian interior ministry said the number of casualties was expected to grow to at least 20,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are being buried in mass graves in bam .
friday morning 's earthquake , which registered 6.3 on the richter scale , literally flattened the city of bam , which has a population of 100,000 and is located on the country ’ s ancient silk road .
german disaster workers save 20 iranian state news agency irna has reported that aid workers from germany ’ s federal disaster relief agency , thw , have already rescued 20 people using search and rescue dogs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thw workers and search dog a spokesman for the technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- said that about 50 german experts are now in iran aiding with rescue work .
the team is equipped with tracking dogs , telescope cameras , drills and other tools they need to locate survivors amid the rubble .
the chances of finding survivors is growing increasingly slim as rescuers race against the clock .
the city has an elevation of 1,000 meters , icy cold weather and other factors that would make it difficult for people to survive more than a few days .
generally , people buried in earthquakes can ’ t survive longer than 72 hours , meaning the chances of finding more people after monday morning would be very low .
but relief workers haven ’ t given up yet .
" this is really about giving people hope and offering our support , " said nicolas hefner , a thw spokesman .
an international effort members of thw ’ s rapid deployment unit search and rescue team -lrb- seeba -rrb- landed on saturday at kerman , a city about 300 kilometers from the quake ’ s epicenter in bam .
they were subsequently transported by iranian military craft to the catastrophe area .
in addition to thw , the plane also carried members of the german red cross , the workers ' samaritan federation , malteser hilfsdienst -lrb- the ambulance corps of the order of malta -rrb- and the association of german rescue dogs , who are joining in the rescue and relief efforts .
aid workers and planes from russia and britain have also arrived in kerman .
there , they join relief workers from switzerland , france and other european union nations as well as china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international federation of red cross and red crescent logo , graphic element on white 1998/2 / 8 at the request of the iranian government , the international red cross and its sister organization red crescent are also delivering 20,000 tens , 200,000 blankets , 30 power generators and 20,000 kerosene heaters .
though neither organization has provided an estimate of the damage caused by the earthquake , officials in geneva said long-term relief would be required as the city is rebuilt and tens of thousands are provided with medical care .

tens of thousands of irishmen fought in world war i we journalists are fond of saying that we have front-row seats in the theatre of history .
nearly all of the time , of course , that 's just rubbish .
it 's something we tell ourselves to compensate for the amount of time we spend ploughing through the minutes of the local council 's planning committee .
a photographer i worked with once said : " if this is what history looks like from the front row , then god knows what the view from the back must be like . "
so , naturally enough , on those rare occasions when we find ourselves writing about history , we tend to look back into the newspaper archives of the time to find out what sort of first draft our colleagues came up with .
war duty i spent some time this year writing about the role played by irish soldiers in the great war .
ireland was part of the united kingdom as well as part of the british empire in 1914 , and in spite of the political unrest of the time , tens of thousands of irishmen volunteered .
no one talked like this at the time of course , but you ca n't help noting now how britain tailored its recruitment advertising to the irish market .
the volunteers are now a ghostly and forgotten army there was much talk of " fighting for the rights of small nations " .
this implied that you could do that more effectively by joining up in support of " plucky little belgium " than by staying at home and joining the ira .
the irish papers at the time were full first of the exploits of the volunteers , then of the names of the dead and the missing .
they joined the millions of casualties in a war that married the technologies of the 20th century with the infantry tactics of the 19th .
but the volunteers are now a ghostly and forgotten army .
selective memory irish history concentrates on the small group of rebels who fought against the crown in the easter rising of 1916 , not on the much larger number fighting for it in british uniform in the same year .
that is natural enough in a way .
a scene from rare film footage of the 1916 easter rising history is always going to reward winners , and the men and women behind the failed revolt against british rule did eventually turn out to be on the winning side .
in the course of my research though , i came across a book which catalogues police casualties in ireland between the years 1919 and 1922 .
in total , 493 officers of the royal irish constabulary -lrb- ric -rrb- were murdered , often when they were alone and defenceless at home , or in tiny isolated rural police posts .
nearly all were irish themselves , mainly catholic and often knew their killers .
this is a period remembered now by irish history as a war of independence , and it is certainly true that britain 's forces carried out brutal raids and reprisals in response to some of the killings .
guerrilla war is an ugly business , and the hard edges of that period have only been slightly softened over time by its depiction in endless jaunty rebel songs .
so the book makes grim reading .
victims you find inside stories like that of william mulherrin , a 39-year-old married man from mayo who was killed as he blessed himself inside the porch of his local church at bandon in county cork .
his killers had lined up by the roadside where he lay and had each been allowed to strike him once in the head with a rifle butt his mistake of course was to go to mass in the same church at the same time too often , allowing his killers to get to know his routine .
grimmer still perhaps , the fate of james plumb , a member of a police patrol ambushed near garrison in county fermanagh .
when his body was recovered afterwards , it was found to have been brutally battered after he died .
it later emerged that his killers had lined up by the roadside where he lay and had each been allowed to strike him once in the head with a rifle butt .
in the newspapers of the period , especially in britain , that kind of brutality and the suffering of the royal irish constabulary was widely and sympathetically reported .
the republicans , who were their enemies , were demonised .
but successful revolutions create entirely new moral and political climates of their own .
no tribute the irish rebellion against britain , which led to the creation of the free state in 1922 , was no exception .
the republican movement of the time emerged victorious although divided and formed a new government , indeed an entirely new political establishment .
michael collins signed the treaty leading to the creation of the irish free state the ric was disbanded .
after all , the order in whose service its members had died had collapsed and britain , the country they 'd served , had withdrawn from most of ireland .
so how does history remember these men , who were heroes to the newspapers of the age ?
well , it does n't and not just because there is no police equivalents of a rebel song .
there are two small plaques commemorating the force in cathedrals in london , but nothing at all , or at least nothing i have ever seen , in ireland itself .
members of the ric , ignored by the new ireland and forgotten by england were n't exactly written out of history .
they were simply never written into it .
my point is not to question who was right and who was wrong in that old conflict , whose resonances are still felt every day somewhere in ireland .
it 's more to remind us all that while we may be familiar with how the events of our day look in the media now , we ca n't know and ca n't even begin to guess how they will look in the context of history .
what will history make of us all ?
now there 's a thought to humble even the most confident of reporters as they settle into those front-row seats .

the prime minister said in a christmas message to uk troops that the iraq survey group -lrb- isg -rrb- had unearthed " massive evidence " of clandestine labs .
the head of the coalition provisional authority said it was not true .
paul bremer said it sounded like a " red herring " made up by someone to upset the rebuilding effort .
it sounds like someone who does n't agree with the policy sets up a red herring then knocks it down paul bremer but mr bremer seems to have been unaware that the quotes had come from mr blair when they were put to him in an interview on itv1 's jonathan dimbleby programme .
" i do n't know where those words come from but that is not what -lrb- isg chief -rrb- david kay has said , " he said .
" i have read his reports so i do n't know who said that .
" it sounds like a bit of a red herring to me .
it sounds like someone who does n't agree with the policy sets up a red herring then knocks it down . "
however when it was pointed out the remarks had come from the leader of the us 's closest ally , mr bremer seemed to pull back from his original remarks .
" there is actually a lot of evidence that had been made public , " he said doubts former chief un weapons inspector hans blix has also cast doubt on mr blair 's assertion .
dr blix said it was " innuendo " to suggest laboratories were used for wmd .
however on sunday , downing street was standing by the prime minister 's comments .
a spokeswoman insisted he was referring to " already published material " in the interim report by the isg .
in the interview with the british forces broadcasting service , mr blair had said : " the iraq survey group has already found massive evidence of a huge system of clandestine laboratories , workings by scientists , plans to develop long range ballistic missiles .
it is high time the prime minister cleared this matter up once and for all menzies campbell liberal democrat " now , frankly , these things were n't being developed unless they were developed for a purpose . "
echoing what mr bremer said , dr blix said that the isg had failed to produce any concrete evidence that the laboratories they had found were working on wmd .
however , mr bremer rejected dr blix 's claim that there were no wmd left for saddam to give up .
" you might conclude that dr blix is out of touch , " he said .
liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said that he would be pressing ministers on the state of the government 's knowledge about iraqi wmd when parliament returns in the new year .
" it is high time the prime minister cleared this matter up once and for all , " he said .
" just exactly what was the british government 's state of knowledge at the time of military action about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and the facilities for manufacturing them ; and what do they know now ? "

but four months later carol , from rugby in warwickshire , has a healthy boy and girl .
and , apart from a few developmental delays , there are no signs to show that rees and ellie were six weeks premature .
carol , who already had a six-year-old daughter , had already suffered a number of miscarriages when she became pregnant with twins .
monitor because of her previous pregnancy history , and because she was carrying twins , medics monitored her pregnancy very carefully .
and when , at 30 weeks , she started suffering from the first signs of obstetric cholestasis , a liver disease first indicated by severe itching , she was admitted to hospital .

" but i knew that the longer they were in the womb the better it would be for them . "
four weeks later scans showed the baby girl had stopped growing and her heart was failing .
an caesarean operation was planned and carol was whisked in for surgery .
minutes later rees was born at a respectable 5lb 14oz and ellie at 4lb 8oz .
care but because they had been born so premature both needed treatment in the special care unit , where rees developed breathing difficulties .
it was three days before carol was able to see her babies .
" i was very poorly after my caesarean so i did not see the twins until they were three days old .
and then when i saw them in the incubator all wired up it was very upsetting .
" obviously it was very scary and worrying , but we knew they were getting the best care from the staff , who did such a good job , feeding , changing and monitoring them .
premature babies each year in the uk one in 10 babies is born before 37 weeks of the 52,000 premature births each year in britain about 2,500 babies will weigh less than 4lb and will require long-term care in a special care baby unit " rees struggled when he was first born , both to breathe and to feed .

although carol 's babies were born six weeks early , some mothers in the same hospital were giving birth up to 10 weeks early .
" there were people who delivered babies who were 10 weeks early .
special care was constantly full - there were babies who were constantly being brought in . "
for three weeks the twins remained in special care before being allowed home with carol and partner rob .
now the twins have no physical signs of their early ordeal , but carol said the doctors had kept a very close eye on their development .
she said that in the first few weeks they had more checks than most babies their age and that she always had to remember they were six weeks behind their contemporaries in terms of physical development .
" normally i would be thinking of weaning the twins to take solids at the age of four months , but we are not even thinking of that yet , they will be doing that just that little bit later , " she said .
because of her experiences , carol and her family are now throwing themselves behind the charity wellbeing 's tiny steps appeal , to help raise cash to support research into prematurity .
" wellbeing do so much - they fund raise and help to buy the incubators and equipment , as well as doing the research .

earlier this year he was made a knight in the new year honours list , adding to the cbe he was awarded in 1996 , for his services to drama .
sir alan made his name on the big screen at the start of the angry young men period in the early 1960s .
the 69-year-old 's first major film saw him play opposite sir laurence olivier in the entertainer in 1960 , a film about a second-rate performer who ensures the show must go on , and written by john osborne .
but sir alan shared no similiarities with the central character of the film , having trained on a scholarship at the world famous royal academy of dramatic arts in london .
raf service followed his training , but two years later , at 22 , he joined the new english stage company at the royal court theatre in london .
in the same year he appeared on stage in osborne 's look back in anger , a performance which turned him into a star .
he performed in works by some of the most respected writers of modern times including harold pinter , simon gray , alan bennett and tom stoppard .
he also performed many of the classics including shakespeare , chekov and ibsen .
merit sir alan , who hailed from derbyshire , worked tirelessly since making his name as an actor , dividing his time between film , television and stage .
but he tended to steer clear of mainstream movies , concentrating on works with more merit than money .
one of his early commercial successes was in georgy girl in 1966 , where he starred with james mason and lynn redgrave .
despite the respect he commands from his peers he was only once nominated for an academy award .
he was nominated for a best actor award in 1969 for the fixer , but lost out on the oscar to cliff robertson in charly .
sir alan also starred in ken russell 's adaptation of d h lawrence 's women in love for which his co-star glenda jackson won the first of two oscars .
twin sons other early screen performances included pinter 's the caretaker , playing basil in zorba the greek and the screen version of a day in the death of joe egg .
sir alan married victoria ward in 1970 .
she gave birth to twin sons , tristan and benedick in 1971 , who both went into acting .
tristan died in 1990 of an asthma attack , followed two years later by his mother .
to help him come to terms with his losses , sir alan threw himself into charity work as well as his career .
he was the patron of the actors centre in london , a venue set up in the 1970s by actors john alderton , sheila hancock and clive swift for the training of performers .
sir alan also endowed a theatre at the covent garden centre in the memory of tristan .
although often looked over for academy awards , the british academy of film and television nominated sir alan on six occasions .
the last bafta nomination was for the 2001 mini-series love in a cold climate , based on nancy mitford 's satire of the british aristocracy .
outstanding cast sir alan had an eye for choosing classy films to appear in , none more so than the 2001 murder mystery gosford park directed by robert altman .
the film received critical acclaim in both britain and the us .
it was nominated for seven oscars , eventually picking up just the one for best-screenplay for actor and writer julian fellowes .
as well as a host of nominations and awards from associations around the world , the ensemble cast won an outstanding performance award from the screen actors guild .
a recent departure for the actor was the role as a baddie in the hollywood blockbuster the sum of all fears , which starred ben affleck .
the recognition kept rolling in for sir alan , who won a tony award in 2002 for best leading man for fortune 's fool , an adaptation of an 1848 work by russian author ivan turgenev .

the link may help to explain other unusual examples of piranha attacks in the country 's rivers .
dams slow the flow of rivers , and may cause an increase in piranha numbers because the fish favour gentle stretches of water for breeding .
details of the outbreaks appear in the scientific journal wilderness and environmental medicine .
one outbreak occurred in the town of santa cruz of conceicao , whose main river is the rio mogi guacu .
dammed portions of the stream are popular with tourists and locals who go there to bathe and swim at weekends .
dormant menace piranhas belonging to the species serrasalmus spilopleura - also known as the speckled piranha - had dwelled in the river and its tributaries in small numbers for many years .
the piranhas spawn in submerged vegetation like water hyacinth no injuries had previously been recorded with bathers or swimmers , according to the authors of the latest report .
but four years ago , injuries due to piranha bites began to be recorded in the town .
they reached a peak in the late summer of 2002 .
over five weekends in 2002 , 38 piranha attacks were recorded .
the rise in attacks has occurred since a dam was built on the river .
two more outbreaks were recorded at the towns of itapui and iacanga , close to dams on the river tiete in southeastern brazil .
over 50 attacks were recorded in total over two weeks at the sites .
neither of the towns previously reported a high frequency of injuries from piranhas .
nest guarding " it 's a direct consequence of damming .
when you dam a river , you create ideal conditions for the piranha population to rise , " professor ivan sazima , a zoologist at the universidade estadual de campinas in sao paulo , brazil , told bbc news online .
bathers often ignore signs like this , which warn of piranhas in the water professor sazima says damming rivers may cause as much as a ten-fold increase in piranha numbers .
piranhas lay their larvae in submerged or floating waterweeds such as water hyacinth , which collects in slow-moving rivers .
when rivers flood , much of this vegetation is swept away and this probably controlled piranha populations in the past .
the vegetation offers protection for these nests of piranha larvae , and parents often " brood " over , or guard , them .
" single bites are caused mainly by the people walking and wading in the waters nearby a piranha nest , " says professor sazima .
feeding frenzy the fish usually bite their victims once , ripping a chunk out of the person and leaving a round , crater-shaped wound with accompanying loss of tissue and bleeding .
the roots of water hyacinth offer protection for juvenile piranhas one of the people bitten during the outbreak at santa cruz of conceicao had to have their toe amputated .
but there are even worse tales of aggression by the fish .
over the years , numerous stories of people being attacked and eaten by ferocious schools of piranhas have surfaced .
the authors of this paper claim there is little scientific evidence to support such behaviour .
they say at least three of the people supposedly killed by schools of piranhas actually died from heart failure or drowning and were only feasted on by the creatures after they expired .
the damming of rivers is becoming increasingly common in south-east brazil due to a greater need for flood protection in this heavily populated region of the country .

the link may help to explain other unusual examples of piranha attacks in the country 's rivers .
dams slow the flow of rivers , and may cause an increase in piranha numbers because the fish favour gentle stretches of water for breeding .
details of the outbreaks appear in the scientific journal wilderness and environmental medicine .
one outbreak occurred in the town of santa cruz of conceicao , whose main river is the rio mogi guacu .
dammed portions of the stream are popular with tourists and locals who go there to bathe and swim at weekends .
dormant menace piranhas belonging to the species serrasalmus spilopleura - also known as the speckled piranha - had dwelled in the river and its tributaries in small numbers for many years .
the piranhas spawn in submerged vegetation like water hyacinth no injuries had previously been recorded with bathers or swimmers , according to the authors of the latest report .
but four years ago , injuries due to piranha bites began to be recorded in the town .
they reached a peak in the late summer of 2002 .
over five weekends in 2002 , 38 piranha attacks were recorded .
the rise in attacks has occurred since a dam was built on the river .
two more outbreaks were recorded at the towns of itapui and iacanga , close to dams on the river tiete in southeastern brazil .
over 50 attacks were recorded in total over two weeks at the sites .
neither of the towns previously reported a high frequency of injuries from piranhas .
nest guarding " it 's a direct consequence of damming .
when you dam a river , you create ideal conditions for the piranha population to rise , " professor ivan sazima , a zoologist at the universidade estadual de campinas in sao paulo , brazil , told bbc news online .
bathers often ignore signs like this , which warn of piranhas in the water professor sazima says damming rivers may cause as much as a ten-fold increase in piranha numbers .
piranhas lay their larvae in submerged or floating waterweeds such as water hyacinth , which collects in slow-moving rivers .
when rivers flood , much of this vegetation is swept away and this probably controlled piranha populations in the past .
the vegetation offers protection for these nests of piranha larvae , and parents often " brood " over , or guard , them .
" single bites are caused mainly by the people walking and wading in the waters nearby a piranha nest , " says professor sazima .
feeding frenzy the fish usually bite their victims once , ripping a chunk out of the person and leaving a round , crater-shaped wound with accompanying loss of tissue and bleeding .
the roots of water hyacinth offer protection for juvenile piranhas one of the people bitten during the outbreak at santa cruz of conceicao had to have their toe amputated .
but there are even worse tales of aggression by the fish .
over the years , numerous stories of people being attacked and eaten by ferocious schools of piranhas have surfaced .
the authors of this paper claim there is little scientific evidence to support such behaviour .
they say at least three of the people supposedly killed by schools of piranhas actually died from heart failure or drowning and were only feasted on by the creatures after they expired .
the damming of rivers is becoming increasingly common in south-east brazil due to a greater need for flood protection in this heavily populated region of the country .
