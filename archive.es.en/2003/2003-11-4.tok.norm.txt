german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .
for this reason , struck stressed that nato partners , europe and the united states must work closer together and in consensus to bring stability to the " greater middle east , " including iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : let 's build a free , democratic and stable iraq in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq -lrb- sept .
26 , 2003 -rrb- .
feedback does nato have a future or will the united states continue to go its own way despite criticism from within the alliance ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.11.2003 security measures against foreign extremists still necessary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german authorities are keeping a close eye on extremists .
more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "
increase understanding schmid said one of the most important tasks for her office is to provide analysis and information that can contribute to a more factual and less emotional discussion of extremism in germany .
in her view , the greatest challenge since the september 11 attacks is to understand the roots of the hatred islamic extremists feel towards the western world , and to develop political solutions to counteract extremism while at the same time preserving civil liberties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a religion under investigation ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.11.2003 eu delays action on french budget deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister francis mer has until the end of the month to present a deficit plan .
france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding .
-lrb- october 13 , 2003 -rrb- paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.11.2003 germany questions legality of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. toppled saddam hussein , but was it a legal military action ?
german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .
the eu has begun to show understanding .
-lrb- october 13 , 2003 -rrb- paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year .

many see it as a new beginning ; an opening of new and potentially fruitful markets , for export and import , and a new age of opportunities for the widening european workforce .
however , not all those rubbing their hands have legitimate interests .
although the criteria for inclusion in the expansion of the european union includes the guarantee of safe borders , stringent policing and the eradication of conflicts within the bloc , the push east is a concern to many who believe such nation bonding will open up new markets for corruption , crime and violence swelling over from the east .
european gateway for gangsters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany , which represents the physical gateway to europe for many of the ex-soviet states preparing for eu membership , this is of particular concern .
when the borders are relaxed in the spirit of eu inclusion , the german government and its eastern neighbors look forward to benefiting from business opportunities arising from the expansion .
but the germans also fear that gangsters operating out of russia will increase their already worrying presence in the country through these new access points .
the tentacles of the ‘ organyzatsia ’ stretch far and wide ; from the streets of moscow , through the corridors of political and economic power in the former communist states to the cities of western europe and beyond .
the mob has many fingers in many pies .
germany , as the first port of call in the push westwards , acts as the reluctant landlord to these unwanted squatters , as drug networks , prostitution rings , people traffickers and arms dealers from the east establish themselves in german cities .
the fear is that , when europe expands , gangsters will sweep through germany and into other areas of western europe .
prostitution run by mafia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the prostitution in germany is allegedly handled by the russians .
the mob contributes to the lucrative trade by trafficking women into the country , mainly from the ukraine and russia , and by controlling the brothels in the main metropolises .
almost 75 percent of the estimated 60,000 to 200,000 prostitutes in germany are foreigners , with around 50 percent of those being east european women from poland , ukraine , bulgaria , romania and the czech republic .
the european expansion could provide gangsters with the opportunity to expand this market .
german officials fear that an increased russian presence could spark off turf wars with established albanian gangs and local criminals .
one specific worry is the 2006 world cup , with security forces already investigating businesses suspected of acquiring properties to be used as brothels in cities that will host the soccer matches .
police say they want to avoid a similar battle to that which erupted nearly three years ago over prostitutes working around the expo 2000 world fair at hanover .
germany : the market place for arms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the more worrying escalations in recent times is the possibility of the russian mafia dealing in nuclear weaponry or weapons grade nuclear material .
the legacy of the partial dismantling of the soviet army has provided the ‘ organyzatsia ’ with access to cheap and seemingly endless supplies of high-quality military weaponry .
while frauds and cons in the past have turned up nothing more dangerous than radioactive soil from chernobyl , security forces have reported seizures of genuine plutonium in recent times .
according to a study by the institute for national strategic studies , germany has emerged as the mafia ’ s main ' shop-window ' for such illegal arms sales and most seizures involving them have been made there , with material mostly arriving from the baltic countries of estonia , latvia , and lithuania .
mob presence widely acknowledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia presence is a problem the german government , and the german people , is well aware of .
from the brazen -lrb- a dubious russian business consortium recently tried to sell a stolen rubens painting back to the germans -rrb- to the bizarre -lrb- german tennis star boris becker claimed his sperm was stolen by the mafia to impregnate a russian model in an attempt to blackmail him -rrb- , the presence of the russian mafia in germany is well documented and not just in the tabloids .
in fact , chancellor gerhard schröder is regularly briefed on who may be involved ahead of any trip to russia , just in case he finds himself in their presence .
schröder also receives information on each visit to moscow as germany and russia try to stem the illegal tide .
but mafia expert and investigative journalist jürgen roth believes that not enough is being done .
roth believes that the steps being taken by the german government are not extensive enough and that the working relationship with russia , although informative , does not go far enough to stop criminal operations from spreading even though there have been warnings from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- .

the mob contributes to the lucrative trade by trafficking women into the country , mainly from the ukraine and russia , and by controlling the brothels in the main metropolises .
almost 75 percent of the estimated 60,000 to 200,000 prostitutes in germany are foreigners , with around 50 percent of those being east european women from poland , ukraine , bulgaria , romania and the czech republic .
the european expansion could provide gangsters with the opportunity to expand this market .
german officials fear that an increased russian presence could spark off turf wars with established albanian gangs and local criminals .
one specific worry is the 2006 world cup , with security forces already investigating businesses suspected of acquiring properties to be used as brothels in cities that will host the soccer matches .
police say they want to avoid a similar battle to that which erupted nearly three years ago over prostitutes working around the expo 2000 world fair at hanover .
germany : the market place for arms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the more worrying escalations in recent times is the possibility of the russian mafia dealing in nuclear weaponry or weapons grade nuclear material .
the legacy of the partial dismantling of the soviet army has provided the ‘ organyzatsia ’ with access to cheap and seemingly endless supplies of high-quality military weaponry .
while frauds and cons in the past have turned up nothing more dangerous than radioactive soil from chernobyl , security forces have reported seizures of genuine plutonium in recent times .
according to a study by the institute for national strategic studies , germany has emerged as the mafia ’ s main ' shop-window ' for such illegal arms sales and most seizures involving them have been made there , with material mostly arriving from the baltic countries of estonia , latvia , and lithuania .
mob presence widely acknowledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia presence is a problem the german government , and the german people , is well aware of .
from the brazen -lrb- a dubious russian business consortium recently tried to sell a stolen rubens painting back to the germans -rrb- to the bizarre -lrb- german tennis star boris becker claimed his sperm was stolen by the mafia to impregnate a russian model in an attempt to blackmail him -rrb- , the presence of the russian mafia in germany is well documented and not just in the tabloids .
in fact , chancellor gerhard schröder is regularly briefed on who may be involved ahead of any trip to russia , just in case he finds himself in their presence .
schröder also receives information on each visit to moscow as germany and russia try to stem the illegal tide .
but mafia expert and investigative journalist jürgen roth believes that not enough is being done .
roth believes that the steps being taken by the german government are not extensive enough and that the working relationship with russia , although informative , does not go far enough to stop criminal operations from spreading even though there have been warnings from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- .
in his latest book , ‘ gangsters of the east , ’ roth warns that there will be dire consequences of ignoring the dangers posed by the mafia in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's poorhouse at the eu 's door moldova , the poorest country in europe , will share a border with the european union when its neighbor romania joins the union .

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .
the european commission has distanced itself from the survey . senior israeli leaders have condemned the eurobarometer poll released on monday that suggested that 59 percent of eu citizens see israel as a bigger menace to the world than iran , iraq or north korea . " we are not only sad but outraged .
not at european citizens but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion , " israel 's mission to the eu said in a statement . israel 's minister for diaspora affairs , natan sharansky , said the poll showed that " behind the ' political ' criticism of israel lies nothing but anti-semitism . " foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .
while he asserted that the poll was " conducted in an irresponsible manner and distorts reality , " he said it did not prove that europeans were anti-semites . prodi : poll wo n't effect eu policy european union politicians have also expressed surprise and concern about the findings . the results " point to the continued existence of a bias that must be condemned outright , " european commission president romano prodi said in a statement .
" to the extent that this may indicate a deeper , more general prejudice against the jewish world , our repugnance is even more radical . " prodi stressed that the results of the poll did not reflect the views of the commission and that they would not effect eu policy in the middle east . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency said the survey 's question had been " misleading . "
his foreign minister , franco frattini , issued a statement to try to calm the furor , saying that the findings related a distorted message . consequences for eu ? the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish organization that combats anti-semitism , condemned the results , and said israel should " draw the only conclusion possible " and exclude the eu from having a role in any peace process . the survey was carried out in october by eos gallup .
the pollsters asked 7,515 citizens from the 15 eu member states which countries posed the greatest threat to world peace .
in the netherlands -lrb- 74 percent -rrb- , austria -lrb- 69 percent -rrb- and germany -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- the largest percentage of people said israel was a menace .
only italy broke with the trend with less than half of those polled saying israel was a threat -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- .
in second place , after israel , were iran , north korea and the united states , which 53 percent of the eu citizens deemed a threat . respondents were not asked whether they viewed the palestinians as a menace because the poll only referred to states , eu commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said at a press briefing . eurobarometer polls are carried out regularly on issues ranging from the common european currency to consumer habits .
the survey in question focused on iraq and international relations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .

terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "
increase understanding schmid said one of the most important tasks for her office is to provide analysis and information that can contribute to a more factual and less emotional discussion of extremism in germany .

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .
the european commission has distanced itself from the survey . senior israeli leaders have condemned the eurobarometer poll released on monday that suggested that 59 percent of eu citizens see israel as a bigger menace to the world than iran , iraq or north korea . " we are not only sad but outraged .
not at european citizens but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion , " israel 's mission to the eu said in a statement . israel 's minister for diaspora affairs , natan sharansky , said the poll showed that " behind the ' political ' criticism of israel lies nothing but anti-semitism . " foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .
while he asserted that the poll was " conducted in an irresponsible manner and distorts reality , " he said it did not prove that europeans were anti-semites . prodi : poll wo n't effect eu policy european union politicians have also expressed surprise and concern about the findings . the results " point to the continued existence of a bias that must be condemned outright , " european commission president romano prodi said in a statement .
" to the extent that this may indicate a deeper , more general prejudice against the jewish world , our repugnance is even more radical . " prodi stressed that the results of the poll did not reflect the views of the commission and that they would not effect eu policy in the middle east . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency said the survey 's question had been " misleading . "
his foreign minister , franco frattini , issued a statement to try to calm the furor , saying that the findings related a distorted message . consequences for eu ? the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish organization that combats anti-semitism , condemned the results , and said israel should " draw the only conclusion possible " and exclude the eu from having a role in any peace process . the survey was carried out in october by eos gallup .
the pollsters asked 7,515 citizens from the 15 eu member states which countries posed the greatest threat to world peace .
in the netherlands -lrb- 74 percent -rrb- , austria -lrb- 69 percent -rrb- and germany -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- the largest percentage of people said israel was a menace .
only italy broke with the trend with less than half of those polled saying israel was a threat -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- .
in second place , after israel , were iran , north korea and the united states , which 53 percent of the eu citizens deemed a threat . respondents were not asked whether they viewed the palestinians as a menace because the poll only referred to states , eu commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said at a press briefing . eurobarometer polls are carried out regularly on issues ranging from the common european currency to consumer habits .
the survey in question focused on iraq and international relations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .
for this reason , struck stressed that nato partners , europe and the united states must work closer together and in consensus to bring stability to the " greater middle east , " including iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : let 's build a free , democratic and stable iraq in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq -lrb- sept .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "
increase understanding schmid said one of the most important tasks for her office is to provide analysis and information that can contribute to a more factual and less emotional discussion of extremism in germany .
in her view , the greatest challenge since the september 11 attacks is to understand the roots of the hatred islamic extremists feel towards the western world , and to develop political solutions to counteract extremism while at the same time preserving civil liberties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a religion under investigation ?

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .
the european commission has distanced itself from the survey . senior israeli leaders have condemned the eurobarometer poll released on monday that suggested that 59 percent of eu citizens see israel as a bigger menace to the world than iran , iraq or north korea . " we are not only sad but outraged .
not at european citizens but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion , " israel 's mission to the eu said in a statement . israel 's minister for diaspora affairs , natan sharansky , said the poll showed that " behind the ' political ' criticism of israel lies nothing but anti-semitism . " foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .
while he asserted that the poll was " conducted in an irresponsible manner and distorts reality , " he said it did not prove that europeans were anti-semites . prodi : poll wo n't effect eu policy european union politicians have also expressed surprise and concern about the findings . the results " point to the continued existence of a bias that must be condemned outright , " european commission president romano prodi said in a statement .
" to the extent that this may indicate a deeper , more general prejudice against the jewish world , our repugnance is even more radical . " prodi stressed that the results of the poll did not reflect the views of the commission and that they would not effect eu policy in the middle east . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency said the survey 's question had been " misleading . "
his foreign minister , franco frattini , issued a statement to try to calm the furor , saying that the findings related a distorted message . consequences for eu ? the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish organization that combats anti-semitism , condemned the results , and said israel should " draw the only conclusion possible " and exclude the eu from having a role in any peace process . the survey was carried out in october by eos gallup .
the pollsters asked 7,515 citizens from the 15 eu member states which countries posed the greatest threat to world peace .
in the netherlands -lrb- 74 percent -rrb- , austria -lrb- 69 percent -rrb- and germany -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- the largest percentage of people said israel was a menace .
only italy broke with the trend with less than half of those polled saying israel was a threat -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- .
in second place , after israel , were iran , north korea and the united states , which 53 percent of the eu citizens deemed a threat . respondents were not asked whether they viewed the palestinians as a menace because the poll only referred to states , eu commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said at a press briefing . eurobarometer polls are carried out regularly on issues ranging from the common european currency to consumer habits .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .

many see it as a new beginning ; an opening of new and potentially fruitful markets , for export and import , and a new age of opportunities for the widening european workforce .
however , not all those rubbing their hands have legitimate interests .
although the criteria for inclusion in the expansion of the european union includes the guarantee of safe borders , stringent policing and the eradication of conflicts within the bloc , the push east is a concern to many who believe such nation bonding will open up new markets for corruption , crime and violence swelling over from the east .
european gateway for gangsters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany , which represents the physical gateway to europe for many of the ex-soviet states preparing for eu membership , this is of particular concern .
when the borders are relaxed in the spirit of eu inclusion , the german government and its eastern neighbors look forward to benefiting from business opportunities arising from the expansion .
but the germans also fear that gangsters operating out of russia will increase their already worrying presence in the country through these new access points .
the tentacles of the ‘ organyzatsia ’ stretch far and wide ; from the streets of moscow , through the corridors of political and economic power in the former communist states to the cities of western europe and beyond .
the mob has many fingers in many pies .
germany , as the first port of call in the push westwards , acts as the reluctant landlord to these unwanted squatters , as drug networks , prostitution rings , people traffickers and arms dealers from the east establish themselves in german cities .
the fear is that , when europe expands , gangsters will sweep through germany and into other areas of western europe .
prostitution run by mafia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the prostitution in germany is allegedly handled by the russians .
the mob contributes to the lucrative trade by trafficking women into the country , mainly from the ukraine and russia , and by controlling the brothels in the main metropolises .
almost 75 percent of the estimated 60,000 to 200,000 prostitutes in germany are foreigners , with around 50 percent of those being east european women from poland , ukraine , bulgaria , romania and the czech republic .
the european expansion could provide gangsters with the opportunity to expand this market .
german officials fear that an increased russian presence could spark off turf wars with established albanian gangs and local criminals .
one specific worry is the 2006 world cup , with security forces already investigating businesses suspected of acquiring properties to be used as brothels in cities that will host the soccer matches .
police say they want to avoid a similar battle to that which erupted nearly three years ago over prostitutes working around the expo 2000 world fair at hanover .
germany : the market place for arms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the more worrying escalations in recent times is the possibility of the russian mafia dealing in nuclear weaponry or weapons grade nuclear material .
the legacy of the partial dismantling of the soviet army has provided the ‘ organyzatsia ’ with access to cheap and seemingly endless supplies of high-quality military weaponry .
while frauds and cons in the past have turned up nothing more dangerous than radioactive soil from chernobyl , security forces have reported seizures of genuine plutonium in recent times .
according to a study by the institute for national strategic studies , germany has emerged as the mafia ’ s main ' shop-window ' for such illegal arms sales and most seizures involving them have been made there , with material mostly arriving from the baltic countries of estonia , latvia , and lithuania .

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .
the european commission has distanced itself from the survey . senior israeli leaders have condemned the eurobarometer poll released on monday that suggested that 59 percent of eu citizens see israel as a bigger menace to the world than iran , iraq or north korea . " we are not only sad but outraged .
not at european citizens but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion , " israel 's mission to the eu said in a statement . israel 's minister for diaspora affairs , natan sharansky , said the poll showed that " behind the ' political ' criticism of israel lies nothing but anti-semitism . " foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .
while he asserted that the poll was " conducted in an irresponsible manner and distorts reality , " he said it did not prove that europeans were anti-semites . prodi : poll wo n't effect eu policy european union politicians have also expressed surprise and concern about the findings . the results " point to the continued existence of a bias that must be condemned outright , " european commission president romano prodi said in a statement .
" to the extent that this may indicate a deeper , more general prejudice against the jewish world , our repugnance is even more radical . " prodi stressed that the results of the poll did not reflect the views of the commission and that they would not effect eu policy in the middle east . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency said the survey 's question had been " misleading . "
his foreign minister , franco frattini , issued a statement to try to calm the furor , saying that the findings related a distorted message . consequences for eu ? the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish organization that combats anti-semitism , condemned the results , and said israel should " draw the only conclusion possible " and exclude the eu from having a role in any peace process . the survey was carried out in october by eos gallup .
the pollsters asked 7,515 citizens from the 15 eu member states which countries posed the greatest threat to world peace .
in the netherlands -lrb- 74 percent -rrb- , austria -lrb- 69 percent -rrb- and germany -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- the largest percentage of people said israel was a menace .
only italy broke with the trend with less than half of those polled saying israel was a threat -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- .
in second place , after israel , were iran , north korea and the united states , which 53 percent of the eu citizens deemed a threat . respondents were not asked whether they viewed the palestinians as a menace because the poll only referred to states , eu commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said at a press briefing . eurobarometer polls are carried out regularly on issues ranging from the common european currency to consumer habits .
the survey in question focused on iraq and international relations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "
increase understanding schmid said one of the most important tasks for her office is to provide analysis and information that can contribute to a more factual and less emotional discussion of extremism in germany .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .
for this reason , struck stressed that nato partners , europe and the united states must work closer together and in consensus to bring stability to the " greater middle east , " including iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : let 's build a free , democratic and stable iraq in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq -lrb- sept .

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .
the european commission has distanced itself from the survey . senior israeli leaders have condemned the eurobarometer poll released on monday that suggested that 59 percent of eu citizens see israel as a bigger menace to the world than iran , iraq or north korea . " we are not only sad but outraged .
not at european citizens but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion , " israel 's mission to the eu said in a statement . israel 's minister for diaspora affairs , natan sharansky , said the poll showed that " behind the ' political ' criticism of israel lies nothing but anti-semitism . " foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .
while he asserted that the poll was " conducted in an irresponsible manner and distorts reality , " he said it did not prove that europeans were anti-semites . prodi : poll wo n't effect eu policy european union politicians have also expressed surprise and concern about the findings . the results " point to the continued existence of a bias that must be condemned outright , " european commission president romano prodi said in a statement .
" to the extent that this may indicate a deeper , more general prejudice against the jewish world , our repugnance is even more radical . " prodi stressed that the results of the poll did not reflect the views of the commission and that they would not effect eu policy in the middle east . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency said the survey 's question had been " misleading . "
his foreign minister , franco frattini , issued a statement to try to calm the furor , saying that the findings related a distorted message . consequences for eu ? the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish organization that combats anti-semitism , condemned the results , and said israel should " draw the only conclusion possible " and exclude the eu from having a role in any peace process . the survey was carried out in october by eos gallup .
the pollsters asked 7,515 citizens from the 15 eu member states which countries posed the greatest threat to world peace .
in the netherlands -lrb- 74 percent -rrb- , austria -lrb- 69 percent -rrb- and germany -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- the largest percentage of people said israel was a menace .
only italy broke with the trend with less than half of those polled saying israel was a threat -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- .
in second place , after israel , were iran , north korea and the united states , which 53 percent of the eu citizens deemed a threat . respondents were not asked whether they viewed the palestinians as a menace because the poll only referred to states , eu commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said at a press briefing . eurobarometer polls are carried out regularly on issues ranging from the common european currency to consumer habits .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .

“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.11.2003 gangsters of the east pose new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian mobsters eye the coming eu expansion as a widening of their business interests ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east . when the current member states welcome the ten new accession countries to the european union in 2004 , it will be the biggest enlargement of the bloc in an existence that stretches over almost half a century .
many see it as a new beginning ; an opening of new and potentially fruitful markets , for export and import , and a new age of opportunities for the widening european workforce .
however , not all those rubbing their hands have legitimate interests .
although the criteria for inclusion in the expansion of the european union includes the guarantee of safe borders , stringent policing and the eradication of conflicts within the bloc , the push east is a concern to many who believe such nation bonding will open up new markets for corruption , crime and violence swelling over from the east .
european gateway for gangsters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany , which represents the physical gateway to europe for many of the ex-soviet states preparing for eu membership , this is of particular concern .
when the borders are relaxed in the spirit of eu inclusion , the german government and its eastern neighbors look forward to benefiting from business opportunities arising from the expansion .
but the germans also fear that gangsters operating out of russia will increase their already worrying presence in the country through these new access points .
the tentacles of the ‘ organyzatsia ’ stretch far and wide ; from the streets of moscow , through the corridors of political and economic power in the former communist states to the cities of western europe and beyond .
the mob has many fingers in many pies .
germany , as the first port of call in the push westwards , acts as the reluctant landlord to these unwanted squatters , as drug networks , prostitution rings , people traffickers and arms dealers from the east establish themselves in german cities .
the fear is that , when europe expands , gangsters will sweep through germany and into other areas of western europe .
prostitution run by mafia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the prostitution in germany is allegedly handled by the russians .
the mob contributes to the lucrative trade by trafficking women into the country , mainly from the ukraine and russia , and by controlling the brothels in the main metropolises .
almost 75 percent of the estimated 60,000 to 200,000 prostitutes in germany are foreigners , with around 50 percent of those being east european women from poland , ukraine , bulgaria , romania and the czech republic .
the european expansion could provide gangsters with the opportunity to expand this market .
german officials fear that an increased russian presence could spark off turf wars with established albanian gangs and local criminals .
one specific worry is the 2006 world cup , with security forces already investigating businesses suspected of acquiring properties to be used as brothels in cities that will host the soccer matches .
police say they want to avoid a similar battle to that which erupted nearly three years ago over prostitutes working around the expo 2000 world fair at hanover .
germany : the market place for arms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the more worrying escalations in recent times is the possibility of the russian mafia dealing in nuclear weaponry or weapons grade nuclear material .
the legacy of the partial dismantling of the soviet army has provided the ‘ organyzatsia ’ with access to cheap and seemingly endless supplies of high-quality military weaponry .
while frauds and cons in the past have turned up nothing more dangerous than radioactive soil from chernobyl , security forces have reported seizures of genuine plutonium in recent times .
according to a study by the institute for national strategic studies , germany has emerged as the mafia ’ s main ' shop-window ' for such illegal arms sales and most seizures involving them have been made there , with material mostly arriving from the baltic countries of estonia , latvia , and lithuania .
mob presence widely acknowledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia presence is a problem the german government , and the german people , is well aware of .
from the brazen -lrb- a dubious russian business consortium recently tried to sell a stolen rubens painting back to the germans -rrb- to the bizarre -lrb- german tennis star boris becker claimed his sperm was stolen by the mafia to impregnate a russian model in an attempt to blackmail him -rrb- , the presence of the russian mafia in germany is well documented and not just in the tabloids .
in fact , chancellor gerhard schröder is regularly briefed on who may be involved ahead of any trip to russia , just in case he finds himself in their presence .
schröder also receives information on each visit to moscow as germany and russia try to stem the illegal tide .
but mafia expert and investigative journalist jürgen roth believes that not enough is being done .
roth believes that the steps being taken by the german government are not extensive enough and that the working relationship with russia , although informative , does not go far enough to stop criminal operations from spreading even though there have been warnings from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- .
in his latest book , ‘ gangsters of the east , ’ roth warns that there will be dire consequences of ignoring the dangers posed by the mafia in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's poorhouse at the eu 's door moldova , the poorest country in europe , will share a border with the european union when its neighbor romania joins the union .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .

terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "
increase understanding schmid said one of the most important tasks for her office is to provide analysis and information that can contribute to a more factual and less emotional discussion of extremism in germany .

while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .
for this reason , struck stressed that nato partners , europe and the united states must work closer together and in consensus to bring stability to the " greater middle east , " including iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : let 's build a free , democratic and stable iraq in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.11.2003 gangsters of the east pose new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian mobsters eye the coming eu expansion as a widening of their business interests ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east . when the current member states welcome the ten new accession countries to the european union in 2004 , it will be the biggest enlargement of the bloc in an existence that stretches over almost half a century .
many see it as a new beginning ; an opening of new and potentially fruitful markets , for export and import , and a new age of opportunities for the widening european workforce .
however , not all those rubbing their hands have legitimate interests .
although the criteria for inclusion in the expansion of the european union includes the guarantee of safe borders , stringent policing and the eradication of conflicts within the bloc , the push east is a concern to many who believe such nation bonding will open up new markets for corruption , crime and violence swelling over from the east .
european gateway for gangsters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany , which represents the physical gateway to europe for many of the ex-soviet states preparing for eu membership , this is of particular concern .
when the borders are relaxed in the spirit of eu inclusion , the german government and its eastern neighbors look forward to benefiting from business opportunities arising from the expansion .

but the germans also fear that gangsters operating out of russia will increase their already worrying presence in the country through these new access points .
the tentacles of the ‘ organyzatsia ’ stretch far and wide ; from the streets of moscow , through the corridors of political and economic power in the former communist states to the cities of western europe and beyond .
the mob has many fingers in many pies .
germany , as the first port of call in the push westwards , acts as the reluctant landlord to these unwanted squatters , as drug networks , prostitution rings , people traffickers and arms dealers from the east establish themselves in german cities .
the fear is that , when europe expands , gangsters will sweep through germany and into other areas of western europe .
prostitution run by mafia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the prostitution in germany is allegedly handled by the russians .
the mob contributes to the lucrative trade by trafficking women into the country , mainly from the ukraine and russia , and by controlling the brothels in the main metropolises .
almost 75 percent of the estimated 60,000 to 200,000 prostitutes in germany are foreigners , with around 50 percent of those being east european women from poland , ukraine , bulgaria , romania and the czech republic .
the european expansion could provide gangsters with the opportunity to expand this market .
german officials fear that an increased russian presence could spark off turf wars with established albanian gangs and local criminals .
one specific worry is the 2006 world cup , with security forces already investigating businesses suspected of acquiring properties to be used as brothels in cities that will host the soccer matches .
police say they want to avoid a similar battle to that which erupted nearly three years ago over prostitutes working around the expo 2000 world fair at hanover .
germany : the market place for arms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the more worrying escalations in recent times is the possibility of the russian mafia dealing in nuclear weaponry or weapons grade nuclear material .
the legacy of the partial dismantling of the soviet army has provided the ‘ organyzatsia ’ with access to cheap and seemingly endless supplies of high-quality military weaponry .
while frauds and cons in the past have turned up nothing more dangerous than radioactive soil from chernobyl , security forces have reported seizures of genuine plutonium in recent times .
according to a study by the institute for national strategic studies , germany has emerged as the mafia ’ s main ' shop-window ' for such illegal arms sales and most seizures involving them have been made there , with material mostly arriving from the baltic countries of estonia , latvia , and lithuania .
mob presence widely acknowledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia presence is a problem the german government , and the german people , is well aware of .
from the brazen -lrb- a dubious russian business consortium recently tried to sell a stolen rubens painting back to the germans -rrb- to the bizarre -lrb- german tennis star boris becker claimed his sperm was stolen by the mafia to impregnate a russian model in an attempt to blackmail him -rrb- , the presence of the russian mafia in germany is well documented and not just in the tabloids .
in fact , chancellor gerhard schröder is regularly briefed on who may be involved ahead of any trip to russia , just in case he finds himself in their presence .
schröder also receives information on each visit to moscow as germany and russia try to stem the illegal tide .
but mafia expert and investigative journalist jürgen roth believes that not enough is being done .
roth believes that the steps being taken by the german government are not extensive enough and that the working relationship with russia , although informative , does not go far enough to stop criminal operations from spreading even though there have been warnings from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- .
in his latest book , ‘ gangsters of the east , ’ roth warns that there will be dire consequences of ignoring the dangers posed by the mafia in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's poorhouse at the eu 's door moldova , the poorest country in europe , will share a border with the european union when its neighbor romania joins the union .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "
increase understanding schmid said one of the most important tasks for her office is to provide analysis and information that can contribute to a more factual and less emotional discussion of extremism in germany .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .

" foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .
the european commission has distanced itself from the survey . senior israeli leaders have condemned the eurobarometer poll released on monday that suggested that 59 percent of eu citizens see israel as a bigger menace to the world than iran , iraq or north korea . " we are not only sad but outraged .
not at european citizens but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion , " israel 's mission to the eu said in a statement . israel 's minister for diaspora affairs , natan sharansky , said the poll showed that " behind the ' political ' criticism of israel lies nothing but anti-semitism . " foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .
while he asserted that the poll was " conducted in an irresponsible manner and distorts reality , " he said it did not prove that europeans were anti-semites . prodi : poll wo n't effect eu policy european union politicians have also expressed surprise and concern about the findings . the results " point to the continued existence of a bias that must be condemned outright , " european commission president romano prodi said in a statement .
" to the extent that this may indicate a deeper , more general prejudice against the jewish world , our repugnance is even more radical . " prodi stressed that the results of the poll did not reflect the views of the commission and that they would not effect eu policy in the middle east . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency said the survey 's question had been " misleading . "
his foreign minister , franco frattini , issued a statement to try to calm the furor , saying that the findings related a distorted message . consequences for eu ? the simon wiesenthal center , an international jewish organization that combats anti-semitism , condemned the results , and said israel should " draw the only conclusion possible " and exclude the eu from having a role in any peace process . the survey was carried out in october by eos gallup .
the pollsters asked 7,515 citizens from the 15 eu member states which countries posed the greatest threat to world peace .
in the netherlands -lrb- 74 percent -rrb- , austria -lrb- 69 percent -rrb- and germany -lrb- 65 percent -rrb- the largest percentage of people said israel was a menace .
only italy broke with the trend with less than half of those polled saying israel was a threat -lrb- 48 percent -rrb- .
in second place , after israel , were iran , north korea and the united states , which 53 percent of the eu citizens deemed a threat . respondents were not asked whether they viewed the palestinians as a menace because the poll only referred to states , eu commission spokesman gerassimos thomas said at a press briefing . eurobarometer polls are carried out regularly on issues ranging from the common european currency to consumer habits .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "

schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .
for this reason , struck stressed that nato partners , europe and the united states must work closer together and in consensus to bring stability to the " greater middle east , " including iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : let 's build a free , democratic and stable iraq in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq -lrb- sept .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.11.2003 gangsters of the east pose new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian mobsters eye the coming eu expansion as a widening of their business interests ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east . when the current member states welcome the ten new accession countries to the european union in 2004 , it will be the biggest enlargement of the bloc in an existence that stretches over almost half a century .
many see it as a new beginning ; an opening of new and potentially fruitful markets , for export and import , and a new age of opportunities for the widening european workforce .
however , not all those rubbing their hands have legitimate interests .
although the criteria for inclusion in the expansion of the european union includes the guarantee of safe borders , stringent policing and the eradication of conflicts within the bloc , the push east is a concern to many who believe such nation bonding will open up new markets for corruption , crime and violence swelling over from the east .
european gateway for gangsters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany , which represents the physical gateway to europe for many of the ex-soviet states preparing for eu membership , this is of particular concern .
when the borders are relaxed in the spirit of eu inclusion , the german government and its eastern neighbors look forward to benefiting from business opportunities arising from the expansion .
but the germans also fear that gangsters operating out of russia will increase their already worrying presence in the country through these new access points .
the tentacles of the ‘ organyzatsia ’ stretch far and wide ; from the streets of moscow , through the corridors of political and economic power in the former communist states to the cities of western europe and beyond .
the mob has many fingers in many pies .
germany , as the first port of call in the push westwards , acts as the reluctant landlord to these unwanted squatters , as drug networks , prostitution rings , people traffickers and arms dealers from the east establish themselves in german cities .
the fear is that , when europe expands , gangsters will sweep through germany and into other areas of western europe .
prostitution run by mafia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the prostitution in germany is allegedly handled by the russians .
the mob contributes to the lucrative trade by trafficking women into the country , mainly from the ukraine and russia , and by controlling the brothels in the main metropolises .
almost 75 percent of the estimated 60,000 to 200,000 prostitutes in germany are foreigners , with around 50 percent of those being east european women from poland , ukraine , bulgaria , romania and the czech republic .
the european expansion could provide gangsters with the opportunity to expand this market .
german officials fear that an increased russian presence could spark off turf wars with established albanian gangs and local criminals .
one specific worry is the 2006 world cup , with security forces already investigating businesses suspected of acquiring properties to be used as brothels in cities that will host the soccer matches .
police say they want to avoid a similar battle to that which erupted nearly three years ago over prostitutes working around the expo 2000 world fair at hanover .
germany : the market place for arms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the more worrying escalations in recent times is the possibility of the russian mafia dealing in nuclear weaponry or weapons grade nuclear material .
the legacy of the partial dismantling of the soviet army has provided the ‘ organyzatsia ’ with access to cheap and seemingly endless supplies of high-quality military weaponry .
while frauds and cons in the past have turned up nothing more dangerous than radioactive soil from chernobyl , security forces have reported seizures of genuine plutonium in recent times .
according to a study by the institute for national strategic studies , germany has emerged as the mafia ’ s main ' shop-window ' for such illegal arms sales and most seizures involving them have been made there , with material mostly arriving from the baltic countries of estonia , latvia , and lithuania .
mob presence widely acknowledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia presence is a problem the german government , and the german people , is well aware of .
from the brazen -lrb- a dubious russian business consortium recently tried to sell a stolen rubens painting back to the germans -rrb- to the bizarre -lrb- german tennis star boris becker claimed his sperm was stolen by the mafia to impregnate a russian model in an attempt to blackmail him -rrb- , the presence of the russian mafia in germany is well documented and not just in the tabloids .
in fact , chancellor gerhard schröder is regularly briefed on who may be involved ahead of any trip to russia , just in case he finds himself in their presence .
schröder also receives information on each visit to moscow as germany and russia try to stem the illegal tide .
but mafia expert and investigative journalist jürgen roth believes that not enough is being done .
roth believes that the steps being taken by the german government are not extensive enough and that the working relationship with russia , although informative , does not go far enough to stop criminal operations from spreading even though there have been warnings from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- .
in his latest book , ‘ gangsters of the east , ’ roth warns that there will be dire consequences of ignoring the dangers posed by the mafia in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's poorhouse at the eu 's door moldova , the poorest country in europe , will share a border with the european union when its neighbor romania joins the union .

france avoided disciplinary action over its budget deficit on monday , as eu finance ministers postponed imposing penalties for breaching the stability pact .
but a german proposal to soften deficit rules was rejected . already reprimanded last month for flaunting the deficit rules designed to protect the stability of the euro , paris on monday gave assurances france would get its budget deficit back under the three percent of gross domestic output by 2005 . french finance minister francis mer told his counterparts from the other 11 euro zone members that paris would outline further steps at a meeting later this month , which was enough for all but three of euro zone countries to back postponing the next step in the disciplinary process . “ france has three weeks time to make progress , not just with commitments , but with clear measures and figures , ” belgian finance minister told reporters in brussels on tuesday .
“ if that isn ’ t possible , we ’ ll continue the process . ” under the terms of the single currency ’ s growth and stability pact , france could be fined up to three billion euros for breaching the three percent deficit limit .
like france , germany has also had a deficit over three percent for 2002 and 2003 .
the euro zone ’ s two largest economies are struggling with their budgets as sluggish growth has hit the public coffers hard . but other european union countries have little sympathy for the economic woes of paris and berlin , especially since both appear on track to remain above the limit next year as well .
that has angered some smaller nations such as the netherlands , austria and finland , which are all models of budgetary restraint and consolidation . german plan rejected those three smaller eu members refused to back the decision giving france more time before moving ahead with the eu disciplinary measure , but they were overruled by the majority of the other states .
however , a german proposal to effectively turn back the clock and give the eu ’ s deficit-challenged more time was soundly rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel in the red .
german finance minister hans eichel said it would be possible for euro members to revert disciplinary procedures to an earlier stage if a troublemaker cooperated with the european commission on its deficit . “ we think that if there is a decision taken by consensus , taken with the partner that is cooperative and we agree about what to do , then you do n't need procedural steps that would spark a fight again , ” eichel told reporters , according to the reuters news agency .
“ you need those procedures if a member state is not cooperative . ” as frustrating as it is for smaller countries with tidy budgets , the franco-german teamwork on stymieing a tougher line on the stability pact is hardly surprising .
eichel is more than aware that although the european commission ’ s critical gaze has been fixed on france of late , it could easily turn to germany next year if the economy fails to grow as expected and berlin is forced to borrow more . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france push growth over stability pact france and germany are pushing for a " flexible " interpretation of the eu stability pact , arguing that growth should take precedence over budgetary consolidation .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .
" that 's why we 've increased the number of islam experts and middle east experts working for us in the office for the protection of the constitution . "
increase understanding schmid said one of the most important tasks for her office is to provide analysis and information that can contribute to a more factual and less emotional discussion of extremism in germany .
in her view , the greatest challenge since the september 11 attacks is to understand the roots of the hatred islamic extremists feel towards the western world , and to develop political solutions to counteract extremism while at the same time preserving civil liberties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a religion under investigation ?

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .
the european commission has distanced itself from the survey . senior israeli leaders have condemned the eurobarometer poll released on monday that suggested that 59 percent of eu citizens see israel as a bigger menace to the world than iran , iraq or north korea . " we are not only sad but outraged .
not at european citizens but at those who are responsible for forming public opinion , " israel 's mission to the eu said in a statement . israel 's minister for diaspora affairs , natan sharansky , said the poll showed that " behind the ' political ' criticism of israel lies nothing but anti-semitism . " foreign minister silvan shalom was more moderate in his criticism , saying that the poll results reflected the greater press coverage that israel receives in comparison to iran or north korea .

two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .

schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .

more than 30,000 muslims living in germany can be classified as islamic extremists , with 4,000 living in berlin alone , estimates the berlin office for the protection of the constitution . at a weekend symposium on islam , the head of the berlin office , claudia schmid , said that while there have not been any attacks by islamic extremists in germany , the danger of islamic terrorism continues to pose a threat which must be closely monitored .
two thirds of foreign extremists living in berlin are islamists , and two thirds of them , in turn , are turkish islamists , many of whom belong to the country 's largest islamic fundamentalist group , milli görüs .
the organization promotes adoption of the sharia , a strict interpretation of the islamic law , and wants its views to be taught in public schools .
majority non-violent despite berlin 's high concentration of foreign extremists , the majority are not violent , schmid said in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" the 2,900 turkish islamists can not be seen as violence-oriented , " she said .
" but there are about 1,000 arab islamists living in berlin who belong to terrorist organisations such as the palestinian group hamas or the lebanese hizbollah .
still , their activities are concentrated on trying to achieve change in their homelands , not in germany .
when they demonstrate in berlin , they do so peacefully . "
terrorist networks germany has clamped down on islamic extremists since it emerged that several of the suicide hijackers involved in the september 11 , 2001 attacks on u.s. cities had lived for years in hamburg .
schmid said that the arrests and trials of islamic extremists since 2,000 have revealed evidence that militant islamists have support networks in germany with the kind of infrastructure to supply them with money , fake documents and mobile phones .
germany is also a place , she said , where extremists attempt to educate young muslims in their ideology , and recruit young people for terrorist activities .
while schmid 's office is striving to create a friendlier image - less traditional secret service and more informed , modern institution - she made it clear that intelligence gathering about the foreign extremist scene will continue .
" there are groups out there that are prepared to use violence to achieve their goals , which are being supported here in berlin , " schmid said .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck ad hoc relationships , he said , could not replace the long-standing alliance , but they would reduce nato to the role of a military " toolbox " for the united states to use at its whim .
the german defense minister stressed that the alliance ’ s principle of consensus was not simply a nuisance that could be overlooked whenever one of the members felt inclined to go their own way .
" nato must not be seen as a servant implementing the decisions made in washington , " struck went on to say .
" anybody who wants a strong nato must prevent this from happening . "
questioning war ’ s legality struck addressed german concerns over the bush administration ’ s new doctrine of preemptive military action to curb potential security threats before they fully materialize .
" preventive -lrb- military -rrb- action requires unambiguous intelligence , " he said .
" the weapons of mass destruction which can not be found in iraq have shown how thin the ice can be when one embarks on a war of self-defense on the basis of supposedly clear proof of an imminent threat . "
therefore , struck said he saw reason enough to question the legality of the war , which washington and london justified by arguing that saddam hussein ’ s alleged weapons of mass destruction posed a threat to peace in the region and world .
" one can ask the question whether what the united states did in iraq was legitimate under international law , " he said .
in general , struck was critical of nato jumping too quickly to military action as a solution to world conflicts .
" military power has its limits , " he cautioned .
" it alone does not enable successful ‘ nation building ’ or lasting stability of the kind that is needed in the balkans , in afghanistan or in iraq , " the minister said referring to regions where military presence is still vital to maintaining peace .

german defense minister peter struck re-ignited the transatlantic spat over the iraq war by questioning the legality of the u.s.-led invasion .
he said american unilateralism endangered nato ’ s principle of consensus . for a while it looked like the united states and germany had pushed their differences over the iraq war behind them and were on a course to repair damaged ties .
germany voted in favor of the most recent united nations resolution on iraq , put forth by the washington administration , and chancellor gerhard schröder shook hands with president george bush while offering tentative technical support in rebuilding the war-torn country .
but on monday evening in berlin , the mending started to unravel again as german defense minister peter struck lashed out at the united states for ignoring the international community and criticized the bush administration for endangering nato ’ s principle of consensus decision-making .
speaking at an international security conference just a stone ’ s throw away from a press conference for outgoing nato secretary general george robertson , who was in berlin as part of a farewell trip to member states , struck said that forming so-called " coalitions of the willing , " such as the one created by washington ahead of the invasion of iraq , jeopardized nato solidarity .
in an unexpected swipe at the leading nato country , struck said it would be more politically astute for the united states to act multilaterally and in tune with other nato partners .

israel has expressed outrage over an eu poll that said most of the union 's citizens see the country as the greatest threat to world peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.11.2003 gangsters of the east pose new threats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian mobsters eye the coming eu expansion as a widening of their business interests ahead of a new report into corruption in the european union accession countries , fears have been rekindled of the possible escalation of gangster activity infiltrating germany from former soviet states in the east . when the current member states welcome the ten new accession countries to the european union in 2004 , it will be the biggest enlargement of the bloc in an existence that stretches over almost half a century .
many see it as a new beginning ; an opening of new and potentially fruitful markets , for export and import , and a new age of opportunities for the widening european workforce .
however , not all those rubbing their hands have legitimate interests .
although the criteria for inclusion in the expansion of the european union includes the guarantee of safe borders , stringent policing and the eradication of conflicts within the bloc , the push east is a concern to many who believe such nation bonding will open up new markets for corruption , crime and violence swelling over from the east .
european gateway for gangsters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany , which represents the physical gateway to europe for many of the ex-soviet states preparing for eu membership , this is of particular concern .
when the borders are relaxed in the spirit of eu inclusion , the german government and its eastern neighbors look forward to benefiting from business opportunities arising from the expansion .
but the germans also fear that gangsters operating out of russia will increase their already worrying presence in the country through these new access points .
the tentacles of the ‘ organyzatsia ’ stretch far and wide ; from the streets of moscow , through the corridors of political and economic power in the former communist states to the cities of western europe and beyond .
the mob has many fingers in many pies .
germany , as the first port of call in the push westwards , acts as the reluctant landlord to these unwanted squatters , as drug networks , prostitution rings , people traffickers and arms dealers from the east establish themselves in german cities .
the fear is that , when europe expands , gangsters will sweep through germany and into other areas of western europe .
prostitution run by mafia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the prostitution in germany is allegedly handled by the russians .
the mob contributes to the lucrative trade by trafficking women into the country , mainly from the ukraine and russia , and by controlling the brothels in the main metropolises .
almost 75 percent of the estimated 60,000 to 200,000 prostitutes in germany are foreigners , with around 50 percent of those being east european women from poland , ukraine , bulgaria , romania and the czech republic .
the european expansion could provide gangsters with the opportunity to expand this market .
german officials fear that an increased russian presence could spark off turf wars with established albanian gangs and local criminals .
one specific worry is the 2006 world cup , with security forces already investigating businesses suspected of acquiring properties to be used as brothels in cities that will host the soccer matches .
police say they want to avoid a similar battle to that which erupted nearly three years ago over prostitutes working around the expo 2000 world fair at hanover .
germany : the market place for arms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the more worrying escalations in recent times is the possibility of the russian mafia dealing in nuclear weaponry or weapons grade nuclear material .
the legacy of the partial dismantling of the soviet army has provided the ‘ organyzatsia ’ with access to cheap and seemingly endless supplies of high-quality military weaponry .
while frauds and cons in the past have turned up nothing more dangerous than radioactive soil from chernobyl , security forces have reported seizures of genuine plutonium in recent times .
according to a study by the institute for national strategic studies , germany has emerged as the mafia ’ s main ' shop-window ' for such illegal arms sales and most seizures involving them have been made there , with material mostly arriving from the baltic countries of estonia , latvia , and lithuania .
mob presence widely acknowledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia presence is a problem the german government , and the german people , is well aware of .
from the brazen -lrb- a dubious russian business consortium recently tried to sell a stolen rubens painting back to the germans -rrb- to the bizarre -lrb- german tennis star boris becker claimed his sperm was stolen by the mafia to impregnate a russian model in an attempt to blackmail him -rrb- , the presence of the russian mafia in germany is well documented and not just in the tabloids .
in fact , chancellor gerhard schröder is regularly briefed on who may be involved ahead of any trip to russia , just in case he finds himself in their presence .
schröder also receives information on each visit to moscow as germany and russia try to stem the illegal tide .
but mafia expert and investigative journalist jürgen roth believes that not enough is being done .
roth believes that the steps being taken by the german government are not extensive enough and that the working relationship with russia , although informative , does not go far enough to stop criminal operations from spreading even though there have been warnings from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- .
in his latest book , ‘ gangsters of the east , ’ roth warns that there will be dire consequences of ignoring the dangers posed by the mafia in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's poorhouse at the eu 's door moldova , the poorest country in europe , will share a border with the european union when its neighbor romania joins the union .

he said the detention of the company 's chief executive , mikhail khodorkovsky , was neither evidence of authoritarianism nor a sign that moscow was considering renationalisation of privatised industries .
speaking to italian journalists ahead of a state visit to italy , mr putin said the yukos case was about law enforcement .
" there will be no de-privatisation or revision of privatisation results .
but one and all should learn the skill of living by the law and observing the law of the country , " mr putin said .
' political ambition ' shares in yukos rose by 12 % following the resignation of mr khodorkovsky .
the tycoon , who has been held on charges of fraud and tax evasion , said he was stepping down from the oil company to protect his workforce .
he said he now planned to dedicate himself to his open russia foundation - an organisation he said that is aimed at building an open and democratic russia .
a bbc moscow correspondent says the statement indicates mr khodorkovsky is preparing to bring forward his declared intention to enter the political arena and challenge those who he believes brought political charges against him .
' good step ' by resigning from the company , mr khodorkovsky is effectively trying to disassociate yukos from the charges facing him of fraud and tax evasion .
in a statement , he said he " must do my utmost to lead our working team out from under the attack which has been directed against me and my partners " .
the fight against mr khodorkovsky is a fight against independent people boris berezovsky a russian stock market analyst , michael sito , says traders had widely welcomed the move .
" investors saw that mr khodorkovsky has put a distance between himself and the company which is seen as a very good step , " he said .
many russians believe the case against mr khodorkovsky , who made his fortune through controversial privatisations in the 1990s , is politically motivated .
he has funded opposition groups , breaking what analysts say was a tacit agreement to stay out of politics in return for avoiding investigation of his financial affairs .
' conservative victory ' the crackdown on yukos and its boss has stirred fears of a wider confrontation between the kremlin and big business .
" the fight against mr khodorkovsky is a fight against independent people , " boris berezovsky , a russian tycoon claiming asylum in britain , told the bbc .
" -lsb- putin -rsb- is now fighting against the most powerful and most independent people . "
analysts have said the yukos affair ranks as the biggest political and economic crisis of president vladimir putin 's three-year period in office .
mr khodorkovsky 's arrest came ahead of parliamentary elections in december , and a presidential election in march .
a bbc correspondent said his decision to step down would be seen by liberals and reformists in russia as a victory for conservative forces in the kremlin , who appear to be flexing their muscles ahead of the elections .

the prison used to take 18 to 20-year-olds but now deals exclusively with under 17s .
ms owers said the institution was teetering on the brink of being unsafe and criticised managers for not effectively tackling bullying and anti-social behaviour .

bskyb said late on monday that james murdoch had been recommended unanimously by a nominations committee made up of four non-executive board members .
james murdoch 's candidacy for the top job has been championed by his father , whose news corporation media conglomerate is bskyb 's biggest shareholder , with a 35 % stake .
i feel confident that james will continue the company 's success rupert murdoch but his appointment goes against the wishes of other bskyb investors , who fear that it will hand too much control to newscorp .
they have also questioned whether 30-year-old james murdoch - previously head of newscorp 's asian pay tv subsidiary , star tv - has the skills and experience needed to run bskyb , europe 's largest and most successful satellite broadcaster .
" we have serious corporate governance concerns that these changes do not appear to address , " said a spokeswoman for the association of british insurers .
" we have no way of telling whether their selection process has been robust and objective , as the company has declined to keep us informed . "
one concern is that with two murdochs at the top , bskyb 's strong cash-flow could be used to prop up the balance sheet at parent news corp. battle lines the issue is likely to come to a head on 14 november , when bskyb is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting .
there has been speculation that some investors may use the meeting to demand that rupert murdoch surrender his role as bskyb chairman as the price for installing his son as chief executive .
it is a a privilege to have the opportunity to play a part in the company 's future james murdoch the company has named banker jacob rothschild to the post of non-executive deputy chairman under murdoch senior , in the hope of staving off concerns .
however , the national association of pension funds - a powerful shareholder lobby - on monday raised the possibility that rebel investors may call an extraordinary general meeting to vote off bskyb 's entire board .
the bskyb succession dispute comes at a time when shareholders are becoming increasingly assertive .
last month , shareholders in itv merger partners carlton and granada blocked the appointment of carlton boss michael green as chairman of the combined company .
in an effort to deflect investor criticism , bskyb said on monday that directors affiliated to newscorp had not voted on the appointment of a new chief executive .
what 's in an age ?
youngest ftse 100 chief executive is simon wolfson , of next , age 35 youngest ftse 100 chairman is viscount rothermere , of daily mail & general trust , age 35 non-executive director , fabiola arrendondo , of boc , is also 35 executive director , george weston , of associated british foods , is 38 oldest ftse 100 director is masao inagaki , 80 , who holds a non-executive post at wpp it added that the nominations committee , headed by lord st john of fawsley , had carried out a " rigorous " search process , and had considered a wide range of " excellent " candidates .
" he follows a series of successful chief executives , " said rupert murdoch .
" i feel confident that james will carry on their work and continue the company 's success . "
path to the top james murdoch said it was " a privilege to have the opportunity to play a part in the company 's future . "
mr murdoch junior 's appointment makes him the youngest chief executive of any ftse 100 company , displacing 35-year old simon wolfson of clothes retailer next .
the younger of rupert murdoch 's sons , he dropped out of harvard in 1995 to launch a hip-hop record label , rawkus , with friends .
he later took charge of newscorp 's internet operations , and helped set up the now defunct australian telecoms venture one-tel , before taking on the top job hong kong-based star tv .

pollsters are predicting that mr koizumi 's liberal democratic party - in power for all but a handful of years in the past half-century - could face a tough challenge from the democratic party of japan in sunday 's poll .
but much rides on perceptions of whether japan 's flagging economy is finally turning the corner .
and after fresh data indicated that the rapid third quarter growth of 7.2 % in the us could be an understatement , record manufacturing figures in japan sent key stocks soaring .
manufacturing activity accelerated faster in october than for two years , a survey said , and shares such as motor giant toyota , with earnings due out later this week , leapt .
by the close , the benchmark nikkei 225 index was up 2.5 % , following strong gains on wall street overnight .
at the same time , the us dollar - which had climbed sharply while a public holiday meant japanese traders took a long - fell back .
japanese companies took advantage of the dollar 's rise to above 111 yen to swap foreign earnings for yen , bringing revenue back home .
but the greenback still closed well above friday 's level in tokyo at 110.12 yen to the us dollar .

the alarm was first raised by villagers in the new territories on sunday .
police and conservation officers were mobilised , but have so far failed to capture the beast .
basking in the sunshine on the banks of the shan pui river the crocodile , some 1.2 metres long , appears unbothered by the excitement it had created .
no one knows where it came from but the authorities suspect it was a pet that escaped or was dumped into the river after it grew too big .
as reporters watched from the safety of the opposite bank , it made one or two lazy attempts to find some dinner in the river before returning to the mudflats to watch them .
chicken trap this croc was no pushover though .
when police and conservation officers approached , planning to shoot it with a tranquilliser gun and net it , the beast slid quietly into the water and disappeared .
nothing has been seen of it since .
lookouts have been posted on the river bank while a large cage baited with half a chicken has been placed in the water .
officials say there is nothing they can do now but watch and wait .

india 's securities and exchange board said foreign holdings on india 's stock exchanges rose by more than $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 900m -rrb- .
the figure takes the gain for 2003 to date to $ 4.6bn , more than six times the figure for the whole of the year before .
the inflow comes as the world 's second biggest country is being seen as in line for solid expansion .
growth hopes india could see economic growth of as much as 7 % this year , the reserve bank of india said on monday as it kept interest rates at an all-time low of 6 % .
that hope has underpinned stock market growth , with the sensex - the benchmark index on the bombay stock exchange - up about 50 % this year .
that rise understates the boom of the past six months , which has amounted to 73 % from a low hit in late april .
robust earnings from key companies such as drugmakers and car firms have underpinned valuations , as has a good monsoon season making life a little easier for the farming sector .
other south asian countries are also showing strong growth , with sri lanka 's stock exchange rising more than 75 % over the past 10 months .

the results come as sales rose 4.3 % over the same period last year .
the profits were in line with expectations following disappointing sales in both its key areas of clothing and food during the hot summer .
overall , though , the firm said its share of the food market was growing .
including one-off charges - which badly impacted the firm 's performance last year - profits were up 14.3 % to £ 326m .
turnaround m & s has spent the past couple of years rebuilding its image and sales , after it lost popularity amid accusations that it was stuffy and out of touch with its customers .
but m & s said current conditions on the high street remained " challenging " .
chief executive roger holmes admitted that there was " work to do " on the clothing side of the business , particularly in women 's tailoring , a traditional strength of the group - although its casualwear business was performing well .
but he said the company 's push into the credit card market - and its plans for new specialist stores focusing on the food and interiors markets , were proceeding according to plan .
and he said m & s was " well set up " for the all-important christmas season , with a gift catalogue 50 % bigger than 2002 's the firm 's largest range to date of party clothing .
trial cost savings would begin to feed through in the next six months , mr holmes promised .
the company is also planning to trial radio tags on its clothing , which it believes could help cut stock-taking costs and prevent shoplifting .
privacy campaigners have criticised the use of so-called radio frequency identifier devices -lrb- rfids -rrb- , saying they could be used to track shoppers ' behaviour even after purchase .
but m & s has said it will look for ways to minimise privacy concerns by making sure they are removed or deactivated at the checkout .

including one-off charges - which badly impacted the firm 's performance last year - profits were up 14.3 % to £ 326m .
turnaround m & s has spent the past couple of years rebuilding its image and sales , after it lost popularity amid accusations that it was stuffy and out of touch with its customers .
but m & s said current conditions on the high street remained " challenging " .
chief executive roger holmes admitted that there was " work to do " on the clothing side of the business , particularly in women 's tailoring , a traditional strength of the group - although its casualwear business was performing well .
but he said the company 's push into the credit card market - and its plans for new specialist stores focusing on the food and interiors markets , were proceeding according to plan .
and he said m & s was " well set up " for the all-important christmas season , with a gift catalogue 50 % bigger than 2002 's the firm 's largest range to date of party clothing .
trial cost savings would begin to feed through in the next six months , mr holmes promised .
the company is also planning to trial radio tags on its clothing , which it believes could help cut stock-taking costs and prevent shoplifting .
privacy campaigners have criticised the use of so-called radio frequency identifier devices -lrb- rfids -rrb- , saying they could be used to track shoppers ' behaviour even after purchase .
but m & s has said it will look for ways to minimise privacy concerns by making sure they are removed or deactivated at the checkout .
