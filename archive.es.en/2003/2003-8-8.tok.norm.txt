german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 comments spark debate on fairness between generations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens are a growing percentage of germany 's population .
the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .
rüdiger erben , district administrator of weissenfels , believes the discovery of the goseck observatory will probably result in some rather unscientific possibilities .
he says he could imagine the site turning into a " mecca for hobby archaeologists and astronomers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 comments spark debate on fairness between generations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens are a growing percentage of germany 's population .
the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2003 german kids go to camp for internet addiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social , health and behavioral problems can stem from excessive internet use most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .
now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all what many people see for most of their day .
but what is so damaging about time spent in front of a computer ?
many people at work spend eight hours a day in front of a screen ; does this mean all those people who work at a keyboard are addicts too ?
looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .
building confidence and esteem dr. trautsch offers advice in her counseling sessions on how to make friends , maintain a healthy diet and build self-confidence .
many of the children have stepped back from society completely and have lost the ability to interact with other people .
the camp organizers say that first results have been encouraging , with most of the children returning home with at least some of their self-confidence restored . more importantly perhaps , they also leave determined to make some changes in their once-internet dominated lifestyle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when the internet gives you a high as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .

the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.08.2003 german kids go to camp for internet addiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social , health and behavioral problems can stem from excessive internet use most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .
now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all what many people see for most of their day .
but what is so damaging about time spent in front of a computer ?
many people at work spend eight hours a day in front of a screen ; does this mean all those people who work at a keyboard are addicts too ?
looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .
rüdiger erben , district administrator of weissenfels , believes the discovery of the goseck observatory will probably result in some rather unscientific possibilities .
he says he could imagine the site turning into a " mecca for hobby archaeologists and astronomers .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all what many people see for most of their day .
but what is so damaging about time spent in front of a computer ?
many people at work spend eight hours a day in front of a screen ; does this mean all those people who work at a keyboard are addicts too ?
looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2003 eu gives microsoft ultimatum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft chairman bill gates has had little luck with the u.s. dept. of justice and the eu commission .
the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

a decision is expected by the end of 2002 .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .

without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .

a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .
nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .
" the actual mandate of isaf lasts until june 2004 according to the underlying political frame , which is the bonn agreement , and nato on the other hand is prepared to take over indefinitely as long as there will be a political need for isaf , " german lieutenant colonel thomas loebbering told reporters at a press conference .
loebbering stressed that non-nato nations would continue to contribute troops to isaf after the north atlantic treaty organisation assumes command , pointing out that non-nato new zealand and switzerland would still provide troops .
isaf currently has around 4,600 troops contributed by 15 nato members and 15 non-nato nations .

a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .
nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .
" the actual mandate of isaf lasts until june 2004 according to the underlying political frame , which is the bonn agreement , and nato on the other hand is prepared to take over indefinitely as long as there will be a political need for isaf , " german lieutenant colonel thomas loebbering told reporters at a press conference .
loebbering stressed that non-nato nations would continue to contribute troops to isaf after the north atlantic treaty organisation assumes command , pointing out that non-nato new zealand and switzerland would still provide troops .
isaf currently has around 4,600 troops contributed by 15 nato members and 15 non-nato nations .
however , around 90 percent of those soldiers are from nato nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.08.2003 archaeologists unearth german stonehenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc is considered the oldest-known image of the cosmos .
german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .
rüdiger erben , district administrator of weissenfels , believes the discovery of the goseck observatory will probably result in some rather unscientific possibilities .
he says he could imagine the site turning into a " mecca for hobby archaeologists and astronomers .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all what many people see for most of their day .
but what is so damaging about time spent in front of a computer ?
many people at work spend eight hours a day in front of a screen ; does this mean all those people who work at a keyboard are addicts too ?
looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .
building confidence and esteem dr. trautsch offers advice in her counseling sessions on how to make friends , maintain a healthy diet and build self-confidence .
many of the children have stepped back from society completely and have lost the ability to interact with other people .
the camp organizers say that first results have been encouraging , with most of the children returning home with at least some of their self-confidence restored . more importantly perhaps , they also leave determined to make some changes in their once-internet dominated lifestyle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when the internet gives you a high as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .

a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .
nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .
" the actual mandate of isaf lasts until june 2004 according to the underlying political frame , which is the bonn agreement , and nato on the other hand is prepared to take over indefinitely as long as there will be a political need for isaf , " german lieutenant colonel thomas loebbering told reporters at a press conference .
loebbering stressed that non-nato nations would continue to contribute troops to isaf after the north atlantic treaty organisation assumes command , pointing out that non-nato new zealand and switzerland would still provide troops .
isaf currently has around 4,600 troops contributed by 15 nato members and 15 non-nato nations .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .
the right prescription for what ails germany - in the unemployment arena - will once again steal the headlines the next few months , as the pros and cons of this new policy are the subject of debate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2003 eu gives microsoft ultimatum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft chairman bill gates has had little luck with the u.s. dept. of justice and the eu commission .
the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2003 eu gives microsoft ultimatum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft chairman bill gates has had little luck with the u.s. dept. of justice and the eu commission .
the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .

italy 's lotto jackpot has hit € 70 million , the highest ever in the history of european lotteries .
the chance at early retirement has sent europeans rushing to bella italia . they come in flocks from austria , slovenia and germany - trying to do what the italians have n't been able to do for the past 22 weeks : find the right combination of six numbers and win a multi-million euro lotto jackpot .
a record-breaking 70 million tickets for a drawing on wednesday night failed to bring a winner for the € 58 million italian jackpot .
now , that number climbs to € 70 million ahead of the next drawing on saturday night . " we 'll have to wait for saturday , then there are over 100,000 combinations that could win , " cessisi mondensini , a spokeswoman for the company that runs the lottery told deutsche welle . italian television put it more to the point : " you are five times more likely to be struck by lightning , " as win the jackpot , according to a recent commentary . but that has n't stopped italians , and lotto tourists from neighboring countries from crossing over the border to dream . " first i 'll buy my mother a house .
a house with a garden on near the sea at the edge of a city , " said one participant from vienna .
" if there something left over , then i 'll balance romania 's budget . " large syndicates take part players have to pick six numbers between 1 and 90 at random in order to win .
tickets start at one euro for two combinations and then go up to € 2.50 , where you can pick five different combinations of numbers . people have already begun to form large syndicates to increase their chances of winning and then divvying up the jackpot .
one 1,000-member syndicate invested around € 600,000 in lottery tickets trying to guess the winning number . italian politicians have already begun worrying about the winner 's fate , calling for measures that allow the multi-million euro jackpot to be made in annual payments and not all at once . but the government will end up being the clear winner .
the italian lottery has been a state-run monopoly for years .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

ground rules laid out by the u.s.-backed administration in iraq have excluded the likes of deutsche telekom ’ s t-mobile arm , france telekom ’ s orange and mobile operators from spain and the netherlands due to the amount of governmental ownership in the companies .

the exclusions , specifically those of deutsche telekom and france telekom , bring up the question of whether companies from countries who opposed the war in iraq are feeling the backlash from the united states .

" after all , the americans are still annoyed over the french attitude towards the iraq war .

responsible for own security the lucky license winners will also need cast iron nerves .
the guidelines for the bidding process specify that the license holders will be responsible for specific site , facility and personal security for their concern in iraq while the coalition military and iraqi police forces continue to struggle with security in the country .
the guidelines also state that the cpa and iraqi government will shoulder no liability for damage or loss to equipment during shipment or installation .

" this is about the money in the shacks of the poor , " said joachim von braun , director of the washington-based international food policy research institute . braun was one of the speakers at a conference in bonn this week , which sought to push the topic of agricultural protectionism to the top of the agenda when wto ministers meet on september 10-14 . failure to do so could mean the failure of the " doha round " of talks and lead to serious consequences for the third world . u.s. , europe trade jabs few observers dispute that developing countries in south america , asia and africa have suffered from the farm protectionism of industrialized nations , many of which pledged free trade at the trade talks in 2001 . international outcry greeted the passage of a bill by the u.s. senate in may 2002 that gave more than $ 170 billion -lrb- € 149 billion -rrb- in subsidies to american farmers over 10 years .
non-profit organizations , as well as the european union criticized the u.s. for encouraging overproduction and reneging on the promises of the doha trade talks . just one year later , the european union came under criticism itself .
the u.s. and roughly a dozen countries took aim at the union 's protectionist measures against the import of genetically-modified food . some eu countries are wary of possible long-term health risks induced by gm foods .
the u.s. says europe is contributing to poverty in africa by not buying genetically-modified products , which are cheaper to produce . the bitter war of words has so far produced only one clear loser , says braun .
third world countries are overloaded with agricultural products " dumped " by industrialized countries who over-produce .
farmers in developing countries are asking for the trade rules to be relaxed .
braun said that could bring in more than € 30 billion .

the verdict is still out on a global climate change . europe is sweltering in the heat of one of the hottest summers anyone can remember .
that 's global warming , people say as they sit under the trees in germany 's beer gardens .
for years scientists have been telling us the climate is heating up and that we should start getting used to hotter summers and warmer winters . the current heat wave that 's battering europe is an indication of global warming , professor christian-dietrich schönwiese of the university of frankfurt 's institute for meteorology told dw-world .
" experts are largely of the opinion that it is global warming .
those who are skeptical are in most cases not experts , " he said . throughout the continent europeans are baking under the intense sun while drought destroys the season 's crops .
vacationers on the mediterranean are getting little relief from bathing in the 32 degree celsius -lrb- 89.6 fahrenheit -rrb- water .
and in portugal and spain firefighters are battling to put out some of the worst forest fires in recent history . already 16 people have died in the blazing inferno . warm weather trend ? climate change has indeed occurred , but it 's not a question of a decade or two of change , rather it 's about three or ten .
the climate has warmed up by 0.7 ° c in the past 100 years .
since the 1970s it has warmed up by 1 ° c in germany . " we are seeing more frequent segments of warm weather , " schönwiese explained .
over the past century germany had very hot summers in 1994 , 1992 , 1983 and 1947 , he said . while some parts of the world , like central africa , are actually getting cooler , most places are warming up , schönwiese said . more freak weather ? but the jury is still out on whether extreme weather conditions like the current heat wave or last year 's devastating floods in germany and other parts of central europe are becoming more common .
" as the global temperatures continue to warm due to climate change , the number and intensity of extreme events might increase , " the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- said in a statement in july . scientists still ca n't say for sure that freak weather will become the norm because the data they have is n't conclusive .
" it would be wrong to draw such conclusions from this summer .
but when you look at the data from 100 years , you see that global warming does exist , " schönwiese said . the only thing for sure is that the climate is changing .
but it 's not necessarily doing it before our very eyes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans plead off work as heat wave stifles in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .
so when people start calling for days off due to the summer heat , it must mean that things are getting pretty hot .
-lrb- august 7 , 2003 -rrb- up in flames : fires ravage southern europe as the mercury climbs higher and higher in europe , forest fires rage across the southern parts of spain and portugal .
the fire-engulfed regions have appealed to their neighbors and the eu for help .
-lrb- august 4 , 2003 -rrb- record heat and drought hit europe a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes -lrb- july 27 , 2003 -rrb- . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .

looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .

located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .

looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .
rüdiger erben , district administrator of weissenfels , believes the discovery of the goseck observatory will probably result in some rather unscientific possibilities .
he says he could imagine the site turning into a " mecca for hobby archaeologists and astronomers .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .

manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .

he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .

however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .

however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .

to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 germany discusses extending afghanistan mandate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is a major concern for german troops stationed in kabul .
a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all what many people see for most of their day .
but what is so damaging about time spent in front of a computer ?
many people at work spend eight hours a day in front of a screen ; does this mean all those people who work at a keyboard are addicts too ?
looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .
building confidence and esteem dr. trautsch offers advice in her counseling sessions on how to make friends , maintain a healthy diet and build self-confidence .
many of the children have stepped back from society completely and have lost the ability to interact with other people .
the camp organizers say that first results have been encouraging , with most of the children returning home with at least some of their self-confidence restored . more importantly perhaps , they also leave determined to make some changes in their once-internet dominated lifestyle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when the internet gives you a high as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .

while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .

" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .

without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 germany discusses extending afghanistan mandate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is a major concern for german troops stationed in kabul .
a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .

nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .

a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all what many people see for most of their day .
but what is so damaging about time spent in front of a computer ?
many people at work spend eight hours a day in front of a screen ; does this mean all those people who work at a keyboard are addicts too ?
looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .
building confidence and esteem dr. trautsch offers advice in her counseling sessions on how to make friends , maintain a healthy diet and build self-confidence .
many of the children have stepped back from society completely and have lost the ability to interact with other people .
the camp organizers say that first results have been encouraging , with most of the children returning home with at least some of their self-confidence restored . more importantly perhaps , they also leave determined to make some changes in their once-internet dominated lifestyle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when the internet gives you a high as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 comments spark debate on fairness between generations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens are a growing percentage of germany 's population .
the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .
“ no pensioner needs to fear my comments , ” he told german zdf television on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de instant aging with a wearable time machine a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .
rüdiger erben , district administrator of weissenfels , believes the discovery of the goseck observatory will probably result in some rather unscientific possibilities .
he says he could imagine the site turning into a " mecca for hobby archaeologists and astronomers .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .

until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .
the right prescription for what ails germany - in the unemployment arena - will once again steal the headlines the next few months , as the pros and cons of this new policy are the subject of debate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2003 eu gives microsoft ultimatum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft chairman bill gates has had little luck with the u.s. dept. of justice and the eu commission .
the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 germany debates sanctioning the unemployed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will this unemployed economist have to take a job in another field or lose his benefits ?
german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .
the right prescription for what ails germany - in the unemployment arena - will once again steal the headlines the next few months , as the pros and cons of this new policy are the subject of debate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists .

he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .

the verdict is still out on a global climate change . europe is sweltering in the heat of one of the hottest summers anyone can remember .
that 's global warming , people say as they sit under the trees in germany 's beer gardens .
for years scientists have been telling us the climate is heating up and that we should start getting used to hotter summers and warmer winters . the current heat wave that 's battering europe is an indication of global warming , professor christian-dietrich schönwiese of the university of frankfurt 's institute for meteorology told dw-world .
" experts are largely of the opinion that it is global warming .
those who are skeptical are in most cases not experts , " he said . throughout the continent europeans are baking under the intense sun while drought destroys the season 's crops .
vacationers on the mediterranean are getting little relief from bathing in the 32 degree celsius -lrb- 89.6 fahrenheit -rrb- water .
and in portugal and spain firefighters are battling to put out some of the worst forest fires in recent history . already 16 people have died in the blazing inferno . warm weather trend ? climate change has indeed occurred , but it 's not a question of a decade or two of change , rather it 's about three or ten .
the climate has warmed up by 0.7 ° c in the past 100 years .
since the 1970s it has warmed up by 1 ° c in germany . " we are seeing more frequent segments of warm weather , " schönwiese explained .
over the past century germany had very hot summers in 1994 , 1992 , 1983 and 1947 , he said . while some parts of the world , like central africa , are actually getting cooler , most places are warming up , schönwiese said . more freak weather ? but the jury is still out on whether extreme weather conditions like the current heat wave or last year 's devastating floods in germany and other parts of central europe are becoming more common .
" as the global temperatures continue to warm due to climate change , the number and intensity of extreme events might increase , " the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- said in a statement in july . scientists still ca n't say for sure that freak weather will become the norm because the data they have is n't conclusive .
" it would be wrong to draw such conclusions from this summer .
but when you look at the data from 100 years , you see that global warming does exist , " schönwiese said . the only thing for sure is that the climate is changing .
but it 's not necessarily doing it before our very eyes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans plead off work as heat wave stifles in terms of working , germans are not exactly known for shirking their responsibilities .

the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 comments spark debate on fairness between generations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens are a growing percentage of germany 's population .
the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .
the right prescription for what ails germany - in the unemployment arena - will once again steal the headlines the next few months , as the pros and cons of this new policy are the subject of debate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 comments spark debate on fairness between generations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens are a growing percentage of germany 's population .
the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .
“ no pensioner needs to fear my comments , ” he told german zdf television on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de instant aging with a wearable time machine a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .

one 1,000-member syndicate invested around € 600,000 in lottery tickets trying to guess the winning number . italian politicians have already begun worrying about the winner 's fate , calling for measures that allow the multi-million euro jackpot to be made in annual payments and not all at once . but the government will end up being the clear winner .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all what many people see for most of their day .
but what is so damaging about time spent in front of a computer ?
many people at work spend eight hours a day in front of a screen ; does this mean all those people who work at a keyboard are addicts too ?
looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .

many of the children have stepped back from society completely and have lost the ability to interact with other people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 germany discusses extending afghanistan mandate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is a major concern for german troops stationed in kabul .
a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .
nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .
" the actual mandate of isaf lasts until june 2004 according to the underlying political frame , which is the bonn agreement , and nato on the other hand is prepared to take over indefinitely as long as there will be a political need for isaf , " german lieutenant colonel thomas loebbering told reporters at a press conference .
loebbering stressed that non-nato nations would continue to contribute troops to isaf after the north atlantic treaty organisation assumes command , pointing out that non-nato new zealand and switzerland would still provide troops .
isaf currently has around 4,600 troops contributed by 15 nato members and 15 non-nato nations .
however , around 90 percent of those soldiers are from nato nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .
nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .
" the actual mandate of isaf lasts until june 2004 according to the underlying political frame , which is the bonn agreement , and nato on the other hand is prepared to take over indefinitely as long as there will be a political need for isaf , " german lieutenant colonel thomas loebbering told reporters at a press conference .
loebbering stressed that non-nato nations would continue to contribute troops to isaf after the north atlantic treaty organisation assumes command , pointing out that non-nato new zealand and switzerland would still provide troops .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .
rüdiger erben , district administrator of weissenfels , believes the discovery of the goseck observatory will probably result in some rather unscientific possibilities .
he says he could imagine the site turning into a " mecca for hobby archaeologists and astronomers .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .
set up by the german social security services , it is the first camp of its kind in europe and aims to wean children off computers by showing them that other aspects of life can be just as enthralling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a computer screen in sight .
located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .
the course at the camp lasts for 28 days and in the final week , parents are invited to attend and participate in the counseling and activities in an attempt to understand the problems and dangers facing their children .

looking for signs of mouse research carried out by experts at the university of florida in the united states has pinpointed a number of factors important in determining whether someone suffers from iad or not .
according to nathan shapira of the university ’ s brain institute , internet activity becomes troublesome when it interferes with someone 's job or social life .
the researchers have compiled the problems central to the disorder under the acronym mouse : more than intended time spent online ; other responsibilities neglected ; unsuccessful attempts to cut down ; significant relationship discord because of use ; and excessive thoughts or anxiety when not online .
the problems the children experience are mostly related to social interaction and physical ailments caused by bad diet and lack of exercise .
children tend to spend hours at the computer alone , snacking rather than eating regular meals .
one of the children at the camp , daniel , who is 13 , weighs 110 kilograms , has no friends at school and has been in constant trouble with his teachers .
on average , he would spend four hours a day in front of the computer and a further eight in front of the television .
these are typical manifestations of the disorder in children , according to dr. simone trautsch , the camp psychologist .

many of the children have stepped back from society completely and have lost the ability to interact with other people .

now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help . often the butt of jokes and ridicule , internet addicts are seen as geeky types who sit for hours on end in darkened rooms , converse only in chat rooms and have virtual relationships with the complete strangers who live thousands of miles away . in the cold light of every day life , such people seem at odds with the normal world around them .
while perhaps extreme , few realize that this stereotype lifestyle is very much the standard existence for many internet addicts and that rather from being a joke , it is a huge problem that is affecting the web generation all over the world .
germany , too , has its share of cases .
although there are no exact statistics , experts say the number of internet addicts in the country is close to 1 million , which amounts to about 3 percent of the german online population .
" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .
much of the increase in internet addiction is among children and young teenagers who spend increasing amounts of time playing computer games or surfing the internet .
and because internet addiction disorder -lrb- iad -rrb- has a very loose framework of diagnosis and is yet to be recognized formally as a chronic psychological problem , it goes unaddressed by many parents .
even more have no idea that help is at hand .
first intenet addiction camp in europe those seeking professional help now can take advantage of a new project , a summer camp in the seaside town of boltenhagen , northern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.08.2003 germany debates sanctioning the unemployed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will this unemployed economist have to take a job in another field or lose his benefits ?
german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .
the right prescription for what ails germany - in the unemployment arena - will once again steal the headlines the next few months , as the pros and cons of this new policy are the subject of debate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?
germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .
but his suggestion to cut the number of holidays has been rejected by the church , unions and even some economists .

the verdict is still out on a global climate change . europe is sweltering in the heat of one of the hottest summers anyone can remember .
that 's global warming , people say as they sit under the trees in germany 's beer gardens .
for years scientists have been telling us the climate is heating up and that we should start getting used to hotter summers and warmer winters . the current heat wave that 's battering europe is an indication of global warming , professor christian-dietrich schönwiese of the university of frankfurt 's institute for meteorology told dw-world .
" experts are largely of the opinion that it is global warming .
those who are skeptical are in most cases not experts , " he said . throughout the continent europeans are baking under the intense sun while drought destroys the season 's crops .

the climate has warmed up by 0.7 ° c in the past 100 years .
since the 1970s it has warmed up by 1 ° c in germany . " we are seeing more frequent segments of warm weather , " schönwiese explained .
over the past century germany had very hot summers in 1994 , 1992 , 1983 and 1947 , he said . while some parts of the world , like central africa , are actually getting cooler , most places are warming up , schönwiese said . more freak weather ? but the jury is still out on whether extreme weather conditions like the current heat wave or last year 's devastating floods in germany and other parts of central europe are becoming more common .
" as the global temperatures continue to warm due to climate change , the number and intensity of extreme events might increase , " the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- said in a statement in july . scientists still ca n't say for sure that freak weather will become the norm because the data they have is n't conclusive .
" it would be wrong to draw such conclusions from this summer .
but when you look at the data from 100 years , you see that global warming does exist , " schönwiese said . the only thing for sure is that the climate is changing .

a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .
nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .
" the actual mandate of isaf lasts until june 2004 according to the underlying political frame , which is the bonn agreement , and nato on the other hand is prepared to take over indefinitely as long as there will be a political need for isaf , " german lieutenant colonel thomas loebbering told reporters at a press conference .
loebbering stressed that non-nato nations would continue to contribute troops to isaf after the north atlantic treaty organisation assumes command , pointing out that non-nato new zealand and switzerland would still provide troops .
isaf currently has around 4,600 troops contributed by 15 nato members and 15 non-nato nations .
however , around 90 percent of those soldiers are from nato nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a top german politician has called for sending military troops beyond the afghan capital of kabul , when the country hands over leadership of international peacekeeping troops in mid-august . gernot erler , foreign affairs expert for the social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on tuesday that germany could “ theoretically deploy ” as many as 700 troops for peacekeeping missions in provinces outside of kabul , where security remains a problem .
the troops would be those freed up from their duties in the current international security assistance force , or isaf , when germany relinquishes its leadership of the troops to nato .
erler was speaking in reaction to reports suggesting that germany could be engaged in afghanistan in a “ regional reconstruction team ” that would go beyond kabul .
until now german troops have been confined to maintaining security in kabul as part of isaf . but christian schmidt , defense policy speaker for the opposition christian social union , dismissed the idea of extending the mandate beyond the capital city , saying the union would not agree to action on such a large scale .
however , both politicians have said that a discussion about the goals of further deployment will be a prerequisite to any decision . seeking clarity “ i don ’ t have the impression that we know what peace-establishing effect this team should have as its goal , ” schmidt said .
but there needs to be a clear concept in place , in order to keep a mandate extension from becoming a political football , he said . a suicide bombing in kabul several months ago killed four german troops and injured 29 others , the worst-ever attack on the force .
the killings heated up debate over the country ’ s role in the isaf force , and raised questions about the need to police areas outside of the capital .
germany has the largest number of troops in isaf , with 2,600 soldiers stationed in kabul . germany has been called upon by the united states , united nations , and afghan president hamid karzai to extend its mission beyond the capital .
currently , the only troops operating outside kabul are those in a u.s.-led coalition force hunting down taliban and al-qaeda remnants in the south and east of afghanistan .
nato stays in place meanwhile , nato has said it will stay in afghanistan as long as it is needed following its takeover of command of the isaf forces in august , an isaf spokesman said earlier this week .
" the actual mandate of isaf lasts until june 2004 according to the underlying political frame , which is the bonn agreement , and nato on the other hand is prepared to take over indefinitely as long as there will be a political need for isaf , " german lieutenant colonel thomas loebbering told reporters at a press conference .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .

german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs . despite a two month decline , the german federal labor office announced that unemployment figures were once again on the rise .
at 4.352 million , they are the second-highest since reunification . that represents an increase of 94,500 , up from 10.2 to 10.4 percent since last month and 305,000 more than at the same time last year .
though the july increase can partly be attributed to seasonal factors , including large numbers of recent school graduates who register as unemployed until they find their first job , the news , is still not good . slow economic recovery makes things worse florian gerster , head of the federal labor office , tried to put a positive spin on things , stating that , given the economic situation , the figures are relatively good and would have been much worse without the latest reforms introduced following the harz commission .
they include the introduction of the so-called " ich ag " -lrb- " me incorporated " -rrb- , which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own business . yet , gerster had to concede that the economic situation in germany - the economy grew by less than 0.2 percent last year - was exacerbating the situation .
there simply are n't enough jobs to go around , and unless the economy improves , so say many experts , neither will the unemployment numbers .
however , gerster stated that the worst is over , and he made a " careful prediction " that the economy would grow by 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2004 , when things are likely to improve . but the unemployment situation is so bad , the current government is not inclined to wait for an economic upswing to help turn things around .
the governing spd party is hoping to take what measures it can , through policy decisions , to get people back to work . active labor market policies , german style the spd party is introducing a bill on august 13 , which , if passed , will introduce a more stringent version of active labor market policies in germany .
such policies , which impose sanctions to compel unemployed people to work and , in some cases , offer additional funding for training , have become popular in the united states , england , denmark , and the netherlands . now a version is up for debate in germany , which would combine social assistance and unemployment benefits as of july of 2004 . garnering the most attention are the punitive measures of the draft bill , which will sanction able-bodied long-term benefit recipients who do n't take the jobs offered to them by the federally funded employment agency .
until now , an engineer , for example , could decline a lower paying job outside his field and he would n't face sanctions . that could soon change .
according to the legislation , benefit recipients will face decreased benefits - as a sanction - by 30 percent for up to three months if they do n't take the jobs offered them .
particularly effected will be the unemployed under the age of 25 , who may have their benefits cut entirely for up to three months .
the new legislation will effect 2.1 households and 4.3 individuals . not enough jobs to go around the proposals will face a tough debate as the critics have already voiced their dissatisfaction . many point to the fact that the chance of finding a suitable position through the employment agency are considerably low .
in this weak economy , there are n't enough jobs .
currently , there are 367,00 registered job openings .
that 's just a drop in the bucket , considering that there are more than 4.35 million on the hunt for a new job . according to heinz putzhammer , a member of the board of the federation of german labor unions , " there are not millions of layabouts in germany , there 's just not millions of jobs . " isolde kunkel-weber , a board member of verdi , another german labor organization , concurs : " the proposal gives the impression that if enough pressure is applied to the unemployed to work , then the problem of unemployment will be solved . " to those arguing from this point-of-view , sanctions only make sense if there 's an excess of jobs available and the unemployed make little effort to find work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2003 eu gives microsoft ultimatum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft chairman bill gates has had little luck with the u.s. dept. of justice and the eu commission .
the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

the u.s. software giant microsoft has one last chance to respond to eu allegations that it is exploiting its dominant position in the personal computer market before brussels slaps it with a fine of up to $ 3.2 billion . time is running out on the world ’ s largest software company .
microsoft corporation has just one " last opportunity " to answer to charges that it has unfairly crushed competitors or face the prospect of fines and enforced guidelines for changing its business practices in europe .
the european commission , the executive arm of the european union , has accused microsoft of exploiting its domination in the computer market to unfairly promote its own products such as media player and to further its position in the market for low-end servers which run web sites and e-mail .
competitors such as oracle corporation and sun microsystems have filed complaints with the commission and have called on competition commissioner mario monti to sanction microsoft for breaking antitrust rules .
under european union monopolies law , if microsoft is found guilty of unfair competition practices , brussels may fine the software giant as much as 10 percent of global sales , or $ 3.2 billion according to bloomberg news .
brussels vs. seattle citing a four-year eu antitrust investigation and a recent survey of consumers , monti on wednesday said microsoft was guilty of using its windows operating system , which runs on more than 90 percent of the world ’ s personal computers , to control markets for computer networks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft software on shelf at a computer store in china .
he also accused the software giant of relying on its media player software , which allows users to play videos on pcs , to prevent competing programs such as apple computer ’ s quick time from gaining a foothold in the multimedia sector .
the european probe was triggered in 1998 after sun , one of the biggest makers of computers running web sites , complained of microsoft ’ s unfair market domination .
the commission ’ s initial findings at the time showed that microsoft withheld information about windows and engaged in discriminatory licensing .
since then , regulators have gathered enough evidence to show that the seattle-based software giant ’ s " abuses are ongoing . "
if the case goes to court this time , the commission is confident it will win on the strength of its findings .
competition spokesman tilman lüder said that brussels had gathered extensive evidence and had compiled " such a substantive file " that any decision the commission takes will " withstand the scrutiny of the european court of justice . "
" it would be at the company ’ s own peril and the lawyers ’ own peril to ignore this " lüder said in a press conference discussing the commission ’ s intent to proceed with the case against microsoft .
the european enforcer in the course of its investigation and preparation of the case , the competition commission sent microsoft a " statement of objections " explaining its findings and recommending changes such as stripping media player from the windows operating system and complying with " core disclosure obligations . "
although microsoft would not be forced to reveal the source code that powers windows , it would be obliged to reveal interface information that would be indispensable for competing software to operate with windows-run pcs and servers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario monti " the statement of objections ... gives microsoft the last opportunity to comment before the commission concludes the case , " monti said in a statement .
" we are determined to ensure that the final outcome of this case is to the benefit of innovation and consumers alike , " he said .
under eu law , microsoft has one month to respond to the commission ’ s findings and is entitled to a hearing .
competitors are then allowed another chance to respond .
if the company is found guilty , it will be faced with fines and a set of restrictions designed to keep its market domination in check .
history of antitrust violations the case against microsoft has a history of dragging on .
back in may 2002 commissioner monti said he expected the case to be completed by the end of the year .
since then , the investigation has only continued to gather more evidence as the eu regulators failed to meet prior deadlines to rule on the case .
two years ago microsoft was found guilty of market abuses in the united states , but the regulatory authorities decided that tough fines would impair the company ’ s ability to innovate .
instead the company was forced to implement new measures to change the way it promotes the windows software .
now microsoft is pointing to the earlier u.s. case arguing with brussels that its settlement with the u.s. department of justice along with previous guarantees it has made to the european commission should fulfill the antitrust requirements .
but the eu , which is intent on differentiating the u.s. case from its own , has said that microsoft has continued to take advantage of its dominant market position to squeeze out smaller competitors .
although commission spokesman lüder , has said the eu will press hard against the company if the accusations hold up in court , he said there is " no reason why the decision should have an impact on transatlantic ties .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

the head of the youth group of germany 's christian democrats has sparked a controversial debate on aging , the country ’ s cash-strapped social security system and whether it can afford hip replacements for pensioners . never before has a 23 year-old caused such a commotion in german politics .
germany 's social system is " not responsible for making every senior citizen fit for a pensioner 's adventure holiday , " said philipp missfelder , head of the conservative opposition ’ s youth outfit the junge union .
the up-and-coming politician told the berlin daily tagesspiegel earlier this week that senior citizens over the age of 85 should no longer receive hip implantations at the cost of the national health system .
after all , people used to just walk on crutches in this case , he said .
dental prostheses should also be limited .
missfelder criticized that politicians from all parties had allowed the principle of solidarity between generations to become a " betrayal , " saying germany 's social system favored the elderly at the expense of the younger generation .
such comments have hit home in a nation with a shrinking population and underfunded health care and pensions .
strong reactions but missfelder 's statements have also been met with outraged reactions from politicians of all stripes .
social democrat and family minister renate schmidt labelled it " inhumane polemics ” and added that his comments could not be excused by his young age , either .
schmidt told german public television that such talk could lead to a debate " in which we discuss the value of life . "
she said this could not be allowed to happen , but admitted that more allowances needed to be made for the interests of children and young people than had been the case in the past years .
however , better chances for the younger generation could not be achieved at the expense of senior citizens , schmidt said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt “ we -lsb- can ’ t -rrb- deny older people the right to claim life prolonging measures or tell them : you can just walk on crutches , " she said .
missfelder also received criticism from his own ranks .
manfred weber , head of the junge union in bavaria , said it was alright to provoke and generate attention .
missfelder 's statements , though , were " complete rubbish , " he told the newspaper münchner merkur .
the christian democrats ' general secretary laurenz meyer said he could not understand missfelder 's comments .
but he added that the fears of young people were justified that politics had insufficiently made allowances for the country 's demographic development .
germany does indeed face a serious demographic problem .
according to the federal office of statistics , the proportion of young to old will shift significantly in the next decades .
latest figures show that in the year 2050 , the proportion of people over 60 will increase from currently one-quarter to one-third .
the percentage of senior citizens over 80 is expected to triple to 12 percent of the population by then .
no war , but debate missfelder said he did not intend to provoke a war between generations .
he reassured the country 's pensioners that he did not want to take anything away from them .
rather , he was referring to the health system in 20 or 30 years .
however , the mentality had to shift from one of " comprehensive cover " to that of " personal liability , " he said .
according to missfelder , his understanding of society was that the strong support the weak .
but this assumed that there still had to be a strong counterpart in the future .
it was not fair that just one specific generation be particularly burdened .
despite the strong criticism , missfelder said he would not take back his remarks .
he said as head of the junge union , he needed to represent his generation and saw it as his concern to keep the debate about generational fairness alive .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .
rüdiger erben , district administrator of weissenfels , believes the discovery of the goseck observatory will probably result in some rather unscientific possibilities .

german experts on thursday hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public . the sleepy town of goseck , nestled in the district of weissenfels in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt shimmers under the brutal summer heat , as residents seek respite in the shade .
nothing in this slumbering locale indicates that one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of all times was made here .
but this is indeed exactly where archaeologists digging in the region last september stumbled upon what they believe is europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory ever unearthed .
on thursday , german experts toasted the discovery as a " milestone in archaeological research " as details of the find were made public .
state archaeologist harald meller said the site , which is believed to be a monument of ancient cult worship , provided the first insights into the spiritual and religious world of europe ’ s earliest farmers .
francois bertemes of the university of halle-wittenberg estimated the site to be around 7,000 years old .
he described its significance as " one of the oldest holy sites " discovered in central europe .
through carbon dating of two arrow heads and animal bones found within the site ’ s circular compounds , archaeologists have been able to determine the date of the site ’ s origins .
they say that with all likelihood it can be traced back to the period between 5000 and 4800 b.c. if that is the case , it would make the goseck site the oldest-dated astronomical observatory in europe .
observatory had scientific and religious value but it ’ s not just its age that makes the goseck location so unusual .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reconstruction of the goseck observatory compared to the approximately 200 other similar prehistoric mound sites strewn throughout europe , the goseck site has striking deviations .
instead of the usual four gates leading into the circular compounds , the goseck monument has just three .
the walled-compound also consists of an unusual formation of concentric rings of man-high wooden palisades .
the rings and the gates into the inner circles become narrower as one progresses to the center , indicating perhaps that only a few people could enter the inner-most ring .
wolfhard schlosser of the ruhr university bochum believes the site 's unique construction indicates that it is indeed one of the earliest examples of an astrological observatory .
schlosser , a specialist in astro-archeology , says the southern gates marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and summer solstice and enabled the early europeans to determine with accuracy the course of the sun as it moved across the heavens .
schlosser is convinced the site was constructed for the observation of astronomical phenomena such as the movements of the sun , moon and stars , and for keeping track of time .
these celestial cycles would have been important for the sowing and harvesting of crops in the early civilization .
but , goseck isn ’ t merely a " calendar construction , " schlosser explains , " but rather is clearly a sacred building . "
archeologists have found plenty of evidence to prove that goseck was a place of prehistoric cult worship .
the arrangement of human bones , for instance , is atypical of burial sites , and telltale cut marks on them indicate that human sacrifice was practiced at the site .
bertemes says it is not uncommon for such astronomical observatories to function as places of worship and centers of religious and social life .
the goseck site , erected by the earliest farming communities between the stone and bronze age , came 3,000 years before the last construction phase of the megaliths of stonehenge in great britain .
links between nebra disc and observatory experts are also drawing parallels between the goseck mounds and another equally spectacular discovery made in the region .
" the formation of the site , its orientation and the marking of the winter and summer solstice shows similarities to the world-famous ‘ nebra disc ’ – though the disc was created 2,400 years later , " schlosser says .
the 3,600-year-old bronze nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometers away from goseck in the wooded region of nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos .
the 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun , moon and starts .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
schlosser believes the formations on the disc were based on previous astrological observations , which could possibly have been made at goseck .
archeologists are certain the observatory with its function of tracking time played a crucial role in a society dominated by the changing seasons .
they theorize that both the goseck observatory and the nebra disc indicate that astronomical knowledge was tied to a mythological-cosmological world view right from the beginning .
a mecca for archeologists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excavation at the goseck site .
archaeologists first took note of the location of the goseck site after aerial images taken in 1991 showed geometrically arranged earth mounds .
but it wasn ’ t until last year that excavation actually got underway .
because the site is being used as learning material for students at the university of halle-wittenberg , it is only open for excavation for a limited number of weeks in the year .
next year a group of students from the university of california at berkley will have a chance to dig in the site .

without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .

" the percentage has remained steady , but the number of internet users has risen -lrb- over the past two years -rrb- from 25 to 30 million , " andré hahn of the market research organization research international told deutsche welle in a recent interview .

located on one of the most beautiful coastal strips on the baltic sea , the children are encouraged to spend as much time as possible outdoors with daily computer allowance curtailed to 30 minutes only .
there is just one computer on the site which can be used for half an hour a day - but not for playing games or surfing the net . every morning there are counseling sessions held by the camp psychologist followed by supervised physical activities at the beach such as swimming , volleyball and aerobics .
quite a change for the self-confessed addicts who admit to using the web and computer games for up to six hours a day to escape the boredom of everyday life . unregulated use at home in germany , many school children spend only about four and a half hours a day at school , often coming home at 1.30 p.m. to an empty house if the parents are at work .
without supervision , the time between their arrival and the time their parents come home from work can often be spent surfing , mailing , chatting and playing games on the computer in a darkened room .
demand for the 60 places has been so high since the camp opened in february that getting a spot can been difficult .

researchers say that in the near future , the disease could become endemic in the uk , and the average outbreak of measles could involve a thousand children rather than dozens .
the latest study , by scientists at the health protection agency and the university of london , is published in the journal science .
one of its authors , professor vincent jansen , said parents who did not protect their children against measles could be storing up major health problems for the future .
we are now approaching the danger zone where measles could again become endemic in the uk professor vincent jansen royal holloway , university of london he said : " we expect this trend to increase over the next four years if vaccine uptake does not increase .
" we are now approaching the danger zone where measles could again become endemic in the uk . "
the number of unvaccinated children in towns across the uk means measles - a potentially fatal or disabling disease - is close to becoming permanently established in the community .
that would mean an end to isolated outbreaks of the virus and the arrival of " self-sustaining " disease in which children could catch it at any time .
complex calculation researchers used a complex formula based on the number of unvaccinated children in a community , the average size of outbreaks and the age profile of the population to work out the risk of major outbreaks .

an unvaccinated child living in a town with 95 % mmr coverage - the government target - enjoys " herd immunity " - protected to a great degree because vaccinated children around him or her can not develop or pass on measles .

researchers say that in the near future , the disease could become endemic in the uk , and the average outbreak of measles could involve a thousand children rather than dozens .
the latest study , by scientists at the health protection agency and the university of london , is published in the journal science .
one of its authors , professor vincent jansen , said parents who did not protect their children against measles could be storing up major health problems for the future .
we are now approaching the danger zone where measles could again become endemic in the uk professor vincent jansen royal holloway , university of london he said : " we expect this trend to increase over the next four years if vaccine uptake does not increase .
" we are now approaching the danger zone where measles could again become endemic in the uk . "
the number of unvaccinated children in towns across the uk means measles - a potentially fatal or disabling disease - is close to becoming permanently established in the community .

their cockle beds were closed by the food standards agency after tests showed the presence of a harmful toxin .
a group of more than 40 of the men gathered outside the agency 's headquarters to express their anger at the closure .
they then intended to take their protest to no.10 downing street , where it was planned to hand in a petition .
the cocklers claim the agency 's tests , which showed the presence of diuretic shellfish poisoning , are not reliable .
the test involves injecting mice with a highly-concentrated mix of cockles and other chemicals .
different tests but the cocklers argue that the human equivalent of this would mean someone eating 1.33 times their own body weight of cockles in one sitting .
disputes over the test have led to a different method of analysis being introduced in ireland , the netherlands and new zealand .
but so far the fsa has refused to follow suit .
this is the second time in days that the welsh cockle industry has been in the news .
earlier this week hundreds of fishermen flocked to the dee estuary beds as restrictions imposed for conservation reasons were lifted for three days .
tough controls are maintained to ensure that the number of cockles - an important source of food for wading birds - do not drop to an unacceptable level .
the environment agency issued more than 600 licences for cocklers at thurstaston and mostyn bank in north wales .
cockle-pickers there have called for the beds to be open for longer periods , but under more strict regulation .
they say the beds mean a huge financial difference to the economy of the area .
colin macdonald who owns a cockle production company in holywell , flintshire argued that three days was not enough to harvest the number of cockles in the river dee .
" i 've got a cockle processing plant that 's ready to go if need be but you ca n't run a business on three days of fishing , " he said .
" the price of cockles is so high it could be a bonanza year . "
but the environment agency says it must first ensure that cockle levels are high enough to allow harvesting without causing a threat to future stock levels .
if the tests show numbers are higher and the cockles are mature enough they are hoping to reopen the beds to the fisherman for a longer period at the end of august .
meanwhile , in the north of england there have been complaints that gangs were coming in from as far afield as malaysia , china and europe to pillage the cockle beds .
in morecambe , 37 suspected illegal immigrants were arrested for picking cockles from a beach in the chatsworth road area .

the event - the 20th - looks like breaking all previous records , but a row over funding is threatening the future of street music in the tiny market town in future years .
although this year 's event looks like being bigger and better than ever before , organisers are still concerned they may have to abandon many of the key attractions after powys county council refused to help with a grant .
just a few weeks ago , organisers of the festival claimed it might have to move because of a row over funding , when the council withdrew an £ 11,000 annual grant towards the cost of the event .
earlier this year , the festival was given more than £ 380,000 by the welsh assembly government to secure its future .
festival director andy eagle said the council 's withdrawal of the grant raised some serious questions about its location .
" at the end of the day , does the town want it ? " he said .
" does the local authority want it ?
these are the sorts of things that make us think , why are we bothering ?
" it is a huge international festival - a unique festival where the whole town has a party for the weekend . "
other towns are known to have courted the festival in previous years , and there have been hints that it could move if the right offer is made .
the money previously provided by the council went towards providing free jazz on the streets of brecon during the festival .
defending its decision , the council said it had had to write off debts of £ 6,600 , and pointed out that the festival had not provided accounts in connection with the application .
the festival also been given the use of council premises free of charge .
in view of this , and because funding had been received from the welsh assembly and commercial sources , the council decided to withhold the grant .
a spokesman said that a letter had been sent to the festival organisers explaining the decision .
brian hennessey , secretary of the welsh jazz society , said that , although he did not know the full reasons behind the council 's decision , it had surprised him .
" i think it is a little short-sighted - the festival has a tremendous reputation worldwide , " he said .
" it is quite remarkable such a fine festival has been produced in a small market town in centre of wales .
" it is something they should be appreciative of and want to retain .
" it brings a lot of commercial interest to shops , pubs and restaurants - it is a benefit to the town and a benefit to the county " i would n't be surprised if there are other places anxious to attract the brecon festival , with far greater facilities and potential for bigger audiences .
" it would be a great pity and a loss to brecon . "
mr hennessey added it was possible that the festival could leave wales .

delivering a speech at the national eisteddfod in mid wales , vice-president mr iwan claimed people were leaving england for wales to escape indian and pakistani immigrants who had settled there .
the labour party has called for him to " do the honourable thing " and step down from his party 's leadership race , but plaid 's chairman has defended his comments .
in his speech - which was given in welsh at the annual cultural festival in meifod - mr iwan highlighted the plight of a shortage of affordable housing for local people in rural wales .
his comments - which he later said had been quoted out of context - come just weeks before plaid cymru members decide whether they will choose him as their new president .
he said the number of english people wishing to move to attractive areas in wales had increased but said some came to get away from immigrants in parts of england .
however , speaking to bbc wales after the speech , mr iwan said his comments had been taken out of context . "
we do n't want people with these racist attitudes in wales " plaid cymru 's dafydd iwan " i was referring to the number of people who come to wales for various reasons - and that this number is going to increase , " he explained .
" we ca n't blame people for wanting to live in such a beautiful area as rural wales , but they must realise that we have a different culture and a different language in many areas .
" recently i 've heard of people who have said that they ca n't live any more with people from indian and pakistani backgrounds in english cities , so they come to wales to escape from them .
" we do n't want people with these racist attitudes in wales . "
mr iwan denied any suggestion that his own comments had been racist .
" i 'm saying that there are examples of people with obvious racist attitudes , " he said .
" what we have to understand is that this world is made up of different cultures and different languages and ways of life , but we are seeing the welsh way of life and the welsh language being undermined by people who do not appreciate other cultures .
" and when they say that they are coming to wales to escape from cultures which they do n't approve of , that 's an example of racism .
" it is not racist to perceive the existence of different languages and different ways of life and different traditions .
what is important is that we learn to co-exist , but also that we have the right to protect what is ours .
" the difficulty in rural wales today is that local people can not afford to buy homes and to get jobs in many of our localities .
but when we get people with racist attitudes and colonialist attitudes moving to wales , then that makes the situation even worse . "
a spokesman for the labour party called on mr iwan to resign from the plaid leadership race , and urged the party to condemn the speech .
" this is a pretty crass attempt to brand english people moving into rural wales as racists , hiding behind the fig-leaf that this is what people say , " the spokesman said .
" the only honourable course of action would be for him to withdraw from the race for the presidency . "
but plaid cymru chair john dixon defended mr iwan .
" it is completely absurd and outrageous to compare these comments with the repugnant agenda of the bnp and fascists , " mr dixon said .
" in making such foolish and groundless attacks , the labour party is simply giving a platform to racists and their views .
plaid cymru rejects racism absolutely . "

the event - the 20th - looks like breaking all previous records , but a row over funding is threatening the future of street music in the tiny market town in future years .
although this year 's event looks like being bigger and better than ever before , organisers are still concerned they may have to abandon many of the key attractions after powys county council refused to help with a grant .
just a few weeks ago , organisers of the festival claimed it might have to move because of a row over funding , when the council withdrew an £ 11,000 annual grant towards the cost of the event .
earlier this year , the festival was given more than £ 380,000 by the welsh assembly government to secure its future .
festival director andy eagle said the council 's withdrawal of the grant raised some serious questions about its location .
george melly has been a staunch supporter " at the end of the day , does the town want it ? " he said .
" does the local authority want it ?
these are the sorts of things that make us think , why are we bothering ?
" it is a huge international festival - a unique festival where the whole town has a party for the weekend . "
other towns are known to have courted the festival in previous years , and there have been hints that it could move if the right offer is made .
the money previously provided by the council went towards providing free jazz on the streets of brecon during the festival .
defending its decision , the council said it had had to write off debts of £ 6,600 , and pointed out that the festival had not provided accounts in connection with the application .
the festival also been given the use of council premises free of charge .
andy eagle questioned whether the town wanted the festival in view of this , and because funding had been received from the welsh assembly and commercial sources , the council decided to withhold the grant .
a spokesman said that a letter had been sent to the festival organisers explaining the decision .
brian hennessey , secretary of the welsh jazz society , said that , although he did not know the full reasons behind the council 's decision , it had surprised him .
" i think it is a little short-sighted - the festival has a tremendous reputation worldwide , " he said .
" it is quite remarkable such a fine festival has been produced in a small market town in centre of wales .
" it is something they should be appreciative of and want to retain .
" it brings a lot of commercial interest to shops , pubs and restaurants - it is a benefit to the town and a benefit to the county " i would n't be surprised if there are other places anxious to attract the brecon festival , with far greater facilities and potential for bigger audiences .
" it would be a great pity and a loss to brecon . "
mr hennessey added it was possible that the festival could leave wales .

delivering a speech at the national eisteddfod in mid wales , vice-president mr iwan claimed people were leaving england for wales to escape indian and pakistani immigrants who had settled there .
the labour party has called for him to " do the honourable thing " and step down from his party 's leadership race , but plaid 's chairman has defended his comments .
in his speech - which was given in welsh at the annual cultural festival in meifod - mr iwan highlighted the plight of a shortage of affordable housing for local people in rural wales .
his comments - which he later said had been quoted out of context - come just weeks before plaid cymru members decide whether they will choose him as their new president .
he said the number of english people wishing to move to attractive areas in wales had increased but said some came to get away from immigrants in parts of england .
however , speaking to bbc wales after the speech , mr iwan said his comments had been taken out of context .
we do n't want people with these racist attitudes in wales plaid cymru 's dafydd iwan " i was referring to the number of people who come to wales for various reasons - and that this number is going to increase , " he explained .
" we ca n't blame people for wanting to live in such a beautiful area as rural wales , but they must realise that we have a different culture and a different language in many areas .
" recently i 've heard of people who have said that they ca n't live any more with people from indian and pakistani backgrounds in english cities , so they come to wales to escape from them .
" we do n't want people with these racist attitudes in wales . "
mr iwan denied any suggestion that his own comments had been racist .
" i 'm saying that there are examples of people with obvious racist attitudes , " he said .
mr iwan has been a singer for 40 years " what we have to understand is that this world is made up of different cultures and different languages and ways of life , but we are seeing the welsh way of life and the welsh language being undermined by people who do not appreciate other cultures .
" and when they say that they are coming to wales to escape from cultures which they do n't approve of , that 's an example of racism .
" it is not racist to perceive the existence of different languages and different ways of life and different traditions .
what is important is that we learn to co-exist , but also that we have the right to protect what is ours .
" the difficulty in rural wales today is that local people can not afford to buy homes and to get jobs in many of our localities .
but when we get people with racist attitudes and colonialist attitudes moving to wales , then that makes the situation even worse . "
a spokesman for the labour party called on mr iwan to resign from the plaid leadership race , and urged the party to condemn the speech .
" this is a pretty crass attempt to brand english people moving into rural wales as racists , hiding behind the fig-leaf that this is what people say , " the spokesman said .
" the only honourable course of action would be for him to withdraw from the race for the presidency . "
but plaid cymru chair john dixon defended mr iwan .
" it is completely absurd and outrageous to compare these comments with the repugnant agenda of the bnp and fascists , " mr dixon said .
" in making such foolish and groundless attacks , the labour party is simply giving a platform to racists and their views .
plaid cymru rejects racism absolutely . "

the works , which were taken over by the french company lafarge , had employed nearly 150 people .
a task force was set with the aim of creating hundreds of new jobs , but plans to regenerate the area have been criticised as being impractical .
among these were a proposal for a new model village with hot springs , tapped from 2,000 feet underground .
the tiny community of eastgate relied heavily on the cement works .
new ideas doctor john bridge , is chairman of regional development agency one north east and a member of the weardale task force .
he said : " out of the 147 the total number still seeking work is two , we have to get that into perspective .
" we have also done a great deal of work trying to build up work at local businesses .
" we have also looked at a wide range of ideas to diversify into new jobs in the dale , including tourism . "
harry irwin , parish council chairman at stanhope , said : " the future is going to be very difficult , but we need some manufacturing job in this dale .
renewable energy " we need someone to come in and create from between 100 and 150 jobs - that is what we need badly .
" there was someone who wanted to get a factory going but everything has been put in his way . "
the upper weardale task force , comprises various bodies including one north east , durham county council , and wear valley district council .
other ideas include developing renewable energy systems in the area including solar power systems and the use of hydro-electricity to power the new model village .
plans are also being looked at to re-open an 18-mile stretch of rail track to restore a service to the weardale area .

the figures are confirmation that in its home market the burger chain 's strategy of promoting new , healthier foods such as salads is pulling in customers .
but in japan , the firm 's tofu-burger strategy appears to be meeting with less success : mcdonald 's japan issued a profit warning on friday , slicing 47 % off its full year profit forecast .
us sales at stores open at least a year jumped 10 % in july against the same month last year , the group said late on thursday .
across the mcdonald 's group as a whole , underlying sales rose 4.2 % .
profit warning japan-based mcdonald 's holdings - half-owned by the us group - said it now expects net income of 2.10bn yen -lrb- $ 17.64m -rrb- in 2003 , rather than 3.96bn yen predicted previously .
the japanese firm cut its revenue forecast for 2003 to 303.4bn yen from its previous estimate of 328.3bn.
it recently introduced price rises .
mcdonald 's last week pointed to higher sales as proof of its success in launching a revival in the group 's overall fortunes , although it has not yet achieved an upturn in profits .
the group reported a fall in profits - to $ 471m -lrb- £ 290m -rrb- in the three months to end-june , from $ 498m a year earlier .
but it said it was encouraged by an 11 % jump in sales .
it attributed falling profits to the high costs of restructuring its business , including the closure of hundreds of restaurants and investment in new products .

nick warner said he was told of the deaths during a meeting with the notorious rebel leader harold keke on the island of guadalcanal .
but he also said that mr keke had promised to surrender his weapons to the peacekeepers within a week , and agreed to allow the intervention force to open a police post near his stronghold .
mr warner gave no details of how or when the missionaries had died .
the six hostages were members of an indigenous anglican order called the melanesian brotherhood .
they had been held by harold keke for several months in his hideout in the remote weathercoast region , and at one stage were shown on australian television smiling and sharing a meal with the rebel leader .
in july three of their colleagues were released on the eve of the arrival of the intervention force .
church leaders said they had no idea why the men had been taken hostage , but correspondents say mr keke is thought to have seized them to use as human shields if the peacekeeping force launched an attack against his men .
the multinational intervention force of about 2,000 troops arrived in the solomons on 24 july , to try to restore stability to the pacific nation and end the rampant corruption .
mr keke is one of the chief reasons for their intervention .
he and his militia have been blamed for a string of killings around weathercoast , and he is said to have personally killed a government minister .
at least 1,200 people are said to have fled nearby villages in recent weeks , to escape mr keke and his followers .
one of the intervention force 's main priorities is to disarm the different rebel factions .
since the force 's arrival , mr warner has already led successful talks with leaders of the malaita eagle force -lrb- mef -rrb- , and the leader of another rebel group , andrew te 'e .
both groups have pledged to surrender their arms before a nationwide firearms amnesty expires on 21 august .
it now appears that harold keke may be willing to do the same .

although his tv career is a shadow of its former self , daniels says that has not affected the warmth of his reception , adding : " there is a greater intensity of interest here . "
he is appearing at the st cut 's fringe venue , performing two shows - one is called an audience with paul daniels and involves exactly that - as well as the promise of " showbiz stories " .
the second show - the magic of max malini - sees the magician weave a fascinating yarn about a little-known conjuror-to-the-rich of the 1920s , splicing his tale with some of malini 's old magic .
daniels , who is appearing at the 600-seat venue until the end of august , says he likes " the amateurishness " of the fringe , adding : " i like the fact there are so many bad acts up here . "
and he is certainly happy with how things are going for him , saying he is " already having a fabulous time - better than i expected " , describing himself as a " happy bunny " .
he is quick to point out to bbc news online that just because he has disappeared from our tv screens , he has never stopped doing the job he loves .
daniels has performed his act around the world he touches on this subject in his act , telling the audience that he no longer does television is because he " ca n't cook " .
undeterred by his lack of tv work , he said there was more value in live performance , adding : " it 's better to go and see a bad live show than to watch a bad tv show .
" television is not big time any more . "
daniels , previously a tv entertainer for 20 years , blames " media studies students trained in demographics " for a general " decline " in tv quality today .
and with his focus firmly on edinburgh , he says that doing two shows has kept him so busy that he has only had time to catch a couple of other acts performing at the same venue as him .
he appears to be at home in the scottish capital , saying that as the son of a cinema owner and nephew of a " naughty " dancing icon , he had always fancied a life in showbiz .
' incredibly intense ' but as a shy child he did not make it until he was in his 30s , finally seeing a male stripper and realising he " could never look as stupid as that " .
taking his cue from " all the great stars , like shirley bassey and ella fitzgerald " , he says he admires their ability to " know nothing will go wrong " and " let it all hang out " .
this is what daniels calls " the entertainment factor " .
as well as performing magic shows around the world , he has continued to create his own brand of entertainment , by becoming a regular on the after-dinner and motivational speaking circuits .
so far he does not know whether he will return to edinburgh yet - it will depend on if he can fit it in .
" my life is incredibly intense and i do n't have much spare time , " he says .
" i keep working because people keep asking me to work . "

the film , which has taken nearly $ 210m -lrb- £ 130m -rrb- so far at the american box office , marks orlando bloom 's first major starring role since he sprang to fame as legolas in the lord of the rings trilogy .
he stars as will turner , a blacksmith who is in love with the wealthy elizabeth swann -lrb- bend it like beckham 's keira knightley -rrb- .
but when she is kidnapped by a band of cursed pirates in search of aztec gold , will is forced to spring to the rescue - with rogue pirate jack sparrow -lrb- johnny depp -rrb- in tow .
as bloom reveals , however , he almost missed out on the chance to star in the film .
tempting script " i was committed to doing the calcium kid , a small british film , " he says , " and as the director of that is a friend i did n't want to let him down " .
" when i got the pirates script i did n't want to tempt myself with it .
" but i was working in australia on ned kelly at the time and my co-star in that , geoffrey rush -lrb- who stars in pirates as the evil captain barbossa -rrb- , said it was a great role and i had to read it " .
not that it was plain sailing from that point .
" i picked up a few scrapes from the sword fight , " bloom admits , " but one of the hardest things was learning the routines .
that was intimidating " .
knightley also found herself thrown in at the deep end when it came to stunts , thanks to the film 's director gore verbinski .
keira knightley has emerged as a star in the us thanks to the film " i thought when i first read the script that i would have a really easy time of it , just sit around and pout a bit and scream a lot and it would all be fine - but gore had other plans and thought it would be great if i tried to do as much of it as possible .
" so i ended up climbing up ships and jumping off the other side and hitting people with golden poles - which actually was great fun " .
the pair also had the chance to work with johnny depp , who almost steals the film as the flamboyant jack sparrow - so much so that there 's already talk of him nabbing nominations come next year 's awards season .
huge hit " actually , his character did n't really read like that on the page , " bloom says .
" i felt really privileged to see how he goes about creating a character .
and it could so easily not have worked but his performances always do " .
for knightley , being part of the film was a whole new experience compared to the low-budget bend it like beckham .
johnny depp : bloom and knightley are big fans " we had 50 crew members on that and this was much bigger - so we could take our time with things .
the football scenes in bend it like beckham were shot really quickly , but on this some of the effects scenes took two weeks to film " .
most notably , it 's given bloom another huge hit following the lord of the rings films and turned knightley into a huge star .
but how do the seemingly down-to-earth pair handle their new found fame ?
" i just think it 's great to have the opportunity to do what we want to do , and to work with people like johnny depp , " knightley says .
" there are ' pinch me ' moments when you ca n't believe it 's all happened , but you take each day at a time and try to have as much fun as possible " .
bloom is similarly philosophical .
" a lot of it is about opportunity and timing , " he says .
" i trained in a class of very talented actors , and everyone has an area of excellence .
it 's just a question of when they get to show it .
certainly the opportunities for both of us came early on . "
