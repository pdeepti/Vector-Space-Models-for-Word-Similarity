shackleton was buried on south georgia polly murray and tash wright are among a team of five adventurers on the demanding route , usually followed by all-male outfits .
the expedition is expected to leave chile on monday and will take in elephant island and south georgia , where the team hope to be the first to conquer a series of inhospitable mountains .
it was on elephant island that many of shackleton 's men waited for months to be rescued as he led a small team to south georgia to raise the alarm after their ship , the endurance , was crushed by ice .
high seas over two-and-a-half months the expedition members hope to cover about 2,000 nautical miles .
they will have to cope with temperatures as low as minus 40c and the notoriously high seas of the southern oceans , including cape horn .
ms wright was picked for the expedition for her vast sailing experience , including work as a skipper off the west coast of scotland .
she spends her winters in the french ski resort of chamonix , where she teaches skiing , and has taken part in previous expeditions to greenland and the arctic .
ms murray was the first female scot to climb mount everest and the first person to complete a telemark ski descent from the summit of the coldest mountain in the world , alaska 's mount mckinley .
she dreamed up the expedition with fellow team member chris tiso while they were at mount everest .
' notoriously inhospitable ' mr tiso , a climber and sailor , said he expected the expedition to be " extremely testing and arduous " .
shackleton 's men haul one of their boats at elephant island the team will take part in a series of exploratory dives , before heading on to south georgia .
once there they " will spend a month climbing , diving and skiing the island 's mountains along the east coast " , said mr tiso .
" some ascents will be a first in conditions that can be notoriously inhospitable . "
the last leg of the expedition will take in the falkland islands , before the team head back to puerto williams in chile .
joining ms murray , ms wright and mr tiso on the voyage are diver and ski instructor sven stewart and mountain guide john whittle .
' tortuous months ' mr tiso said the parallels with shackleton 's expedition were important to the team .
he said : " elephant island holds particular interest and significance for me as it was , of course , where shackleton 's men spent four long tortuous months living under their lifeboats waiting to be rescued by the man himself . "
shackleton and a small team travelled on to south georgia , walking across the island to reach stromness on 20 may , 1916 , where a whaling factory provided their first contact with the outside world in 17 months .
shackleton was buried on south georgia following his death in 1922 .
