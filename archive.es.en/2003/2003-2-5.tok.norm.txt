unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

a shift in charges ordered by the hamburg judge overseeing the trial of mounir el motassadeq could make it easier to convict the suspected al qaeda terrorist . hamburg -lrb- dw -rrb- - federal prosecutors are expected to begin closing arguments on wednesday following a hamburg judge 's rejection of the last motions by the defense attorneys for mounir el motassadeq , the moroccan man charged with aiding the sept .
11 hijackers .
chief judge albrecht mentz accepted an explanation on tuesday by germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the german interior ministry that the agencies ' investigative ability and reputations could be damaged if the court be allowed to hear the questioning of mohammed haydar zammar .
officials say zammar is the al qaeda operative who helped bring together the hamburg terror cell , led by mohammed atta , that is suspected of carrying out the sept .
11 attacks .
german intelligence has in its possession copies of zammar 's testimony , conducted shortly after he was taken into custody .
he is believed to be in a syrian jail cell .
the defense submitted a motion last thursday , stating that zammar 's testimony could better define motassadeq 's knowledge of the sept .
11 attacks .
motassadeq , 28 , has been charged with more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for the sept .
11 attacks .
on tuesday , mentz changed the second charge against motassadeq , of membership in a terrorist organization , to support of a terrorist organization .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .

his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2003 in search of a better future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abandoning ship for a better life frustrated with bleak prospects on the job front and unhappy with life at home , an increasing number of germans are leaving their country in search of greener pastures abroad . is germany losing some of its best-educated , highly qualified and talented nationals ? the answer to that may not be straightforward , but christina busch confirms that more germans than ever are looking for ways to get out of germany .
busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .
the berlin office alone , " christina busch told dw-world .
she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .
she works for the organization ’ s foreign service , which advises doctors on having qualifications recognized abroad and ensuring further training will be recognized if they return to germany . “ until now there were comparatively few enquiries , but it is an increasing trend , ” kattelhön admits .
she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .
however , that includes all germans who went abroad , whether temporarily or permanently . red tape and lack of friendiness driving germans away although germany ’ s labor and economics minister announced that unemployment reached a five-year high of 4.5 million in january , lack of work is not necessarily what is driving people away . busch also discounts speculation that the political situation is at fault .
" it has nothing to do with the parliamentary elections -lrb- in september -rrb- , " she exclaims .
the wave of interest in emigrating began earlier , she says . many of the people wanting to emigrate go abroad to further their careers , while others are married to a foreigner and plan to move to their spouse ’ s homeland , says busch . one major reason for people wanting to leave germany , according to busch , is the lack of warmth and friendliness in the country . common complaints she hears while counseling people fed up with gemany are , " i feel increasingly uneasy here , it ’ s just not right here anymore , i don ’ t want to be here anymore .
it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .
craftsmen , medical personnel , architects , it specialists and pensioners come looking for advice .
most of them find jobs abroad before they move . at the moment busch is advising a farming family that has decided to sell its stead here to go farm in canada .
“ we ’ re fed up with the bureaucracy , ” the farmers told her . most of busch ’ s clients see the u.s. as the best option , followed by spain , canada , australia and france respectively . whether the german migrants eventually return home is unclear .
both busch and kattelhön have little contact with people who want to return .
dr. kattelhön , however , speaks from her own experience working as an internal specialist abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2003 germany 's unemployment rate hits five-year high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a number : job hunters wait for assistance in frankfurt .
unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .
she works for the organization ’ s foreign service , which advises doctors on having qualifications recognized abroad and ensuring further training will be recognized if they return to germany . “ until now there were comparatively few enquiries , but it is an increasing trend , ” kattelhön admits .
she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .
however , that includes all germans who went abroad , whether temporarily or permanently . red tape and lack of friendiness driving germans away although germany ’ s labor and economics minister announced that unemployment reached a five-year high of 4.5 million in january , lack of work is not necessarily what is driving people away . busch also discounts speculation that the political situation is at fault .
" it has nothing to do with the parliamentary elections -lrb- in september -rrb- , " she exclaims .
the wave of interest in emigrating began earlier , she says . many of the people wanting to emigrate go abroad to further their careers , while others are married to a foreigner and plan to move to their spouse ’ s homeland , says busch . one major reason for people wanting to leave germany , according to busch , is the lack of warmth and friendliness in the country . common complaints she hears while counseling people fed up with gemany are , " i feel increasingly uneasy here , it ’ s just not right here anymore , i don ’ t want to be here anymore .
it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .
craftsmen , medical personnel , architects , it specialists and pensioners come looking for advice .
most of them find jobs abroad before they move . at the moment busch is advising a farming family that has decided to sell its stead here to go farm in canada .
“ we ’ re fed up with the bureaucracy , ” the farmers told her . most of busch ’ s clients see the u.s. as the best option , followed by spain , canada , australia and france respectively . whether the german migrants eventually return home is unclear .
both busch and kattelhön have little contact with people who want to return .
dr. kattelhön , however , speaks from her own experience working as an internal specialist abroad .
“ if i had wanted to continue working as a doctor , i would have stayed in switzerland , ” she says . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coal miners go west the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2003 interview : wtc design finalist daniel libeskind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first we take manhattan : daniel libeskind 's proposed design the judges in the competition to replace the world trade center like what they have seen of daniel libeskind 's memory foundations .
soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture in england and new york ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war and conflict in manchester daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture in england and new york ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war and conflict in manchester daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2003 in search of a better future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abandoning ship for a better life frustrated with bleak prospects on the job front and unhappy with life at home , an increasing number of germans are leaving their country in search of greener pastures abroad . is germany losing some of its best-educated , highly qualified and talented nationals ? the answer to that may not be straightforward , but christina busch confirms that more germans than ever are looking for ways to get out of germany .
busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .
the berlin office alone , " christina busch told dw-world .
she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture in england and new york ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war and conflict in manchester daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture in england and new york ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war and conflict in manchester daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .
the berlin office alone , " christina busch told dw-world .
she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .
she works for the organization ’ s foreign service , which advises doctors on having qualifications recognized abroad and ensuring further training will be recognized if they return to germany . “ until now there were comparatively few enquiries , but it is an increasing trend , ” kattelhön admits .
she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .
however , that includes all germans who went abroad , whether temporarily or permanently . red tape and lack of friendiness driving germans away although germany ’ s labor and economics minister announced that unemployment reached a five-year high of 4.5 million in january , lack of work is not necessarily what is driving people away . busch also discounts speculation that the political situation is at fault .
" it has nothing to do with the parliamentary elections -lrb- in september -rrb- , " she exclaims .
the wave of interest in emigrating began earlier , she says . many of the people wanting to emigrate go abroad to further their careers , while others are married to a foreigner and plan to move to their spouse ’ s homeland , says busch . one major reason for people wanting to leave germany , according to busch , is the lack of warmth and friendliness in the country . common complaints she hears while counseling people fed up with gemany are , " i feel increasingly uneasy here , it ’ s just not right here anymore , i don ’ t want to be here anymore .
it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .
craftsmen , medical personnel , architects , it specialists and pensioners come looking for advice .
most of them find jobs abroad before they move . at the moment busch is advising a farming family that has decided to sell its stead here to go farm in canada .
“ we ’ re fed up with the bureaucracy , ” the farmers told her . most of busch ’ s clients see the u.s. as the best option , followed by spain , canada , australia and france respectively . whether the german migrants eventually return home is unclear .
both busch and kattelhön have little contact with people who want to return .
dr. kattelhön , however , speaks from her own experience working as an internal specialist abroad .
“ if i had wanted to continue working as a doctor , i would have stayed in switzerland , ” she says . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coal miners go west the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .
the berlin office alone , " christina busch told dw-world .
she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .
she works for the organization ’ s foreign service , which advises doctors on having qualifications recognized abroad and ensuring further training will be recognized if they return to germany . “ until now there were comparatively few enquiries , but it is an increasing trend , ” kattelhön admits .
she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .
however , that includes all germans who went abroad , whether temporarily or permanently . red tape and lack of friendiness driving germans away although germany ’ s labor and economics minister announced that unemployment reached a five-year high of 4.5 million in january , lack of work is not necessarily what is driving people away . busch also discounts speculation that the political situation is at fault .
" it has nothing to do with the parliamentary elections -lrb- in september -rrb- , " she exclaims .
the wave of interest in emigrating began earlier , she says . many of the people wanting to emigrate go abroad to further their careers , while others are married to a foreigner and plan to move to their spouse ’ s homeland , says busch . one major reason for people wanting to leave germany , according to busch , is the lack of warmth and friendliness in the country . common complaints she hears while counseling people fed up with gemany are , " i feel increasingly uneasy here , it ’ s just not right here anymore , i don ’ t want to be here anymore .
it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .
craftsmen , medical personnel , architects , it specialists and pensioners come looking for advice .
most of them find jobs abroad before they move . at the moment busch is advising a farming family that has decided to sell its stead here to go farm in canada .
“ we ’ re fed up with the bureaucracy , ” the farmers told her . most of busch ’ s clients see the u.s. as the best option , followed by spain , canada , australia and france respectively . whether the german migrants eventually return home is unclear .
both busch and kattelhön have little contact with people who want to return .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2003 in search of a better future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abandoning ship for a better life frustrated with bleak prospects on the job front and unhappy with life at home , an increasing number of germans are leaving their country in search of greener pastures abroad . is germany losing some of its best-educated , highly qualified and talented nationals ? the answer to that may not be straightforward , but christina busch confirms that more germans than ever are looking for ways to get out of germany .
busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .
the berlin office alone , " christina busch told dw-world .
she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .
she works for the organization ’ s foreign service , which advises doctors on having qualifications recognized abroad and ensuring further training will be recognized if they return to germany . “ until now there were comparatively few enquiries , but it is an increasing trend , ” kattelhön admits .
she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .
however , that includes all germans who went abroad , whether temporarily or permanently . red tape and lack of friendiness driving germans away although germany ’ s labor and economics minister announced that unemployment reached a five-year high of 4.5 million in january , lack of work is not necessarily what is driving people away . busch also discounts speculation that the political situation is at fault .
" it has nothing to do with the parliamentary elections -lrb- in september -rrb- , " she exclaims .
the wave of interest in emigrating began earlier , she says . many of the people wanting to emigrate go abroad to further their careers , while others are married to a foreigner and plan to move to their spouse ’ s homeland , says busch . one major reason for people wanting to leave germany , according to busch , is the lack of warmth and friendliness in the country . common complaints she hears while counseling people fed up with gemany are , " i feel increasingly uneasy here , it ’ s just not right here anymore , i don ’ t want to be here anymore .
it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .
craftsmen , medical personnel , architects , it specialists and pensioners come looking for advice .
most of them find jobs abroad before they move . at the moment busch is advising a farming family that has decided to sell its stead here to go farm in canada .
“ we ’ re fed up with the bureaucracy , ” the farmers told her . most of busch ’ s clients see the u.s. as the best option , followed by spain , canada , australia and france respectively . whether the german migrants eventually return home is unclear .
both busch and kattelhön have little contact with people who want to return .
dr. kattelhön , however , speaks from her own experience working as an internal specialist abroad .
“ if i had wanted to continue working as a doctor , i would have stayed in switzerland , ” she says . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german coal miners go west the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .

a shift in charges ordered by the hamburg judge overseeing the trial of mounir el motassadeq could make it easier to convict the suspected al qaeda terrorist . hamburg -lrb- dw -rrb- - federal prosecutors are expected to begin closing arguments on wednesday following a hamburg judge 's rejection of the last motions by the defense attorneys for mounir el motassadeq , the moroccan man charged with aiding the sept .
11 hijackers .
chief judge albrecht mentz accepted an explanation on tuesday by germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the german interior ministry that the agencies ' investigative ability and reputations could be damaged if the court be allowed to hear the questioning of mohammed haydar zammar .
officials say zammar is the al qaeda operative who helped bring together the hamburg terror cell , led by mohammed atta , that is suspected of carrying out the sept .
11 attacks .
german intelligence has in its possession copies of zammar 's testimony , conducted shortly after he was taken into custody .
he is believed to be in a syrian jail cell .
the defense submitted a motion last thursday , stating that zammar 's testimony could better define motassadeq 's knowledge of the sept .
11 attacks .
motassadeq , 28 , has been charged with more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for the sept .
11 attacks .
on tuesday , mentz changed the second charge against motassadeq , of membership in a terrorist organization , to support of a terrorist organization .
the change will ease the burden of proof on the prosecution 's side and subsequently ease the possible sentence motassadeq faces from 10 years to 5 years for that charge .
the former moroccan student complained in open court on tuesday that he felt like " collateral damage " in the war on terrorism .
" it may be true that the cooperation between two countries is more important than a person , " he said in response to the court 's rejection of the defense motions .
" but i do n't want to become collateral damage , " he told the court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture in england and new york ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war and conflict in manchester daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities .

chief judge albrecht mentz accepted an explanation on tuesday by germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the german interior ministry that the agencies ' investigative ability and reputations could be damaged if the court be allowed to hear the questioning of mohammed haydar zammar .
officials say zammar is the al qaeda operative who helped bring together the hamburg terror cell , led by mohammed atta , that is suspected of carrying out the sept .

german intelligence has in its possession copies of zammar 's testimony , conducted shortly after he was taken into custody .
he is believed to be in a syrian jail cell .
the defense submitted a motion last thursday , stating that zammar 's testimony could better define motassadeq 's knowledge of the sept .

motassadeq , 28 , has been charged with more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for the sept .

the change will ease the burden of proof on the prosecution 's side and subsequently ease the possible sentence motassadeq faces from 10 years to 5 years for that charge .
the former moroccan student complained in open court on tuesday that he felt like " collateral damage " in the war on terrorism .

officials say zammar is the al qaeda operative who helped bring together the hamburg terror cell , led by mohammed atta , that is suspected of carrying out the sept .
11 attacks .
german intelligence has in its possession copies of zammar 's testimony , conducted shortly after he was taken into custody .
he is believed to be in a syrian jail cell .
the defense submitted a motion last thursday , stating that zammar 's testimony could better define motassadeq 's knowledge of the sept .
11 attacks .
motassadeq , 28 , has been charged with more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for the sept .
11 attacks .
on tuesday , mentz changed the second charge against motassadeq , of membership in a terrorist organization , to support of a terrorist organization .
the change will ease the burden of proof on the prosecution 's side and subsequently ease the possible sentence motassadeq faces from 10 years to 5 years for that charge .
the former moroccan student complained in open court on tuesday that he felt like " collateral damage " in the war on terrorism .
" it may be true that the cooperation between two countries is more important than a person , " he said in response to the court 's rejection of the defense motions .
" but i do n't want to become collateral damage , " he told the court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .

his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture in england and new york ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war and conflict in manchester daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities .

busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .
the berlin office alone , " christina busch told dw-world .
she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .
she works for the organization ’ s foreign service , which advises doctors on having qualifications recognized abroad and ensuring further training will be recognized if they return to germany . “ until now there were comparatively few enquiries , but it is an increasing trend , ” kattelhön admits .
she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .
however , that includes all germans who went abroad , whether temporarily or permanently . red tape and lack of friendiness driving germans away although germany ’ s labor and economics minister announced that unemployment reached a five-year high of 4.5 million in january , lack of work is not necessarily what is driving people away . busch also discounts speculation that the political situation is at fault .
" it has nothing to do with the parliamentary elections -lrb- in september -rrb- , " she exclaims .
the wave of interest in emigrating began earlier , she says . many of the people wanting to emigrate go abroad to further their careers , while others are married to a foreigner and plan to move to their spouse ’ s homeland , says busch . one major reason for people wanting to leave germany , according to busch , is the lack of warmth and friendliness in the country . common complaints she hears while counseling people fed up with gemany are , " i feel increasingly uneasy here , it ’ s just not right here anymore , i don ’ t want to be here anymore .
it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .
craftsmen , medical personnel , architects , it specialists and pensioners come looking for advice .
most of them find jobs abroad before they move . at the moment busch is advising a farming family that has decided to sell its stead here to go farm in canada .
“ we ’ re fed up with the bureaucracy , ” the farmers told her . most of busch ’ s clients see the u.s. as the best option , followed by spain , canada , australia and france respectively . whether the german migrants eventually return home is unclear .

a shift in charges ordered by the hamburg judge overseeing the trial of mounir el motassadeq could make it easier to convict the suspected al qaeda terrorist . hamburg -lrb- dw -rrb- - federal prosecutors are expected to begin closing arguments on wednesday following a hamburg judge 's rejection of the last motions by the defense attorneys for mounir el motassadeq , the moroccan man charged with aiding the sept .

chief judge albrecht mentz accepted an explanation on tuesday by germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the german interior ministry that the agencies ' investigative ability and reputations could be damaged if the court be allowed to hear the questioning of mohammed haydar zammar .
officials say zammar is the al qaeda operative who helped bring together the hamburg terror cell , led by mohammed atta , that is suspected of carrying out the sept .
11 attacks .
german intelligence has in its possession copies of zammar 's testimony , conducted shortly after he was taken into custody .
he is believed to be in a syrian jail cell .
the defense submitted a motion last thursday , stating that zammar 's testimony could better define motassadeq 's knowledge of the sept .

on tuesday , mentz changed the second charge against motassadeq , of membership in a terrorist organization , to support of a terrorist organization .
the change will ease the burden of proof on the prosecution 's side and subsequently ease the possible sentence motassadeq faces from 10 years to 5 years for that charge .
the former moroccan student complained in open court on tuesday that he felt like " collateral damage " in the war on terrorism .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .

his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .

at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .
" they -lrb- the slurry walls -rrb- are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . "
public spaces in the libeskind design include the wedge of light - a space perfectly aligned so that every sept .
11 between 8:46 a.m. and 10:28 a.m. the space will be completely drenched in light .
the periods mark the time when the first plane hit the world trade center and the time when the second tower collapsed .
the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .
" i never think of -lrb- my -rrb- chances .
i think of doing a scheme which has integrity and which has a quality which touches not only the mind but the soul , " he said .

soon , they will announce whether they like it enough to select it as the winner . berlin - daniel libeskind , the architect of berlin 's famous jewish museum , moved one step closer this week to becoming the person who fills the void created by the terrorists who slammed their skyjacked airliners into new york 's world trade center on sept .
11 , 2001 .
" it 's a fantastic responsibility and a wonderful moment , " libeskind told dw-world in a telephone interview from new york on wednesday .
libeskind learned on tuesday that his concept had become one of the two finalists to survive a selection process in which hundreds of ideas submitted last year were whittled down to seven and then to two .
one of those two will emerge as the winner to be announced by the end of the month .
the competition now pits the berlin-based libeskind against a new york-based team called think .
memory foundations libeskind 's design is titled memory foundations .
it bears this name , the polish-born jewish émigré says , because it is about the depth of memory intrinsically linked to the sept .
11 attacks as well as the foundations of the future of new york .
" it 's about how to bring together the seemingly contradictory aspects of the memorial , which is about a tragedy and how it changed the world , but also about creating a vital and beautiful city of the 21st century , " he told dw-world .
" that 's the task , how to do it in a meaningful way and in a way which re-activates the role of manhattan . "
using the bedrock of the former world trade center - massive slurry walls that withstood the attacks - as a basis for his design , libeskind 's proposal will take visitors on a procession 70 feet down into the excavated site at ground zero , something that libeskind said was vital to his vision .
' sacred and spiritual area ' " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said .

the park of heroes - the other main public space - is a matrix linking all the public spaces in the design , and represents the directions and places from where rescuers came to help victims .
the 11 million square feet of office space planned for the new structure will be housed in a ring of lower-rise buildings .
the design also includes public gardens housed in a glass tower .
inspired by the eiffel tower the think team 's design takes its inspiration from the eiffel tower in paris and the dual towers of light beamed from ground zero in march .
it consists of two hollow lattice structures .
the proposal is a " reincarnation of the world trade center into a world cultural center , " team member rafael vinoly told the new york times .
the other team members are frederic schwartz , ken smith and shigeru ban .
as the final decision nears , libeskind is modest about his chances .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel libeskind , architect of the expansion project at the denver art museum , is shown in front of the existing building of the art museum in this undated photograph from 2001 libeskind , born in poland in 1946 , is no stranger to replacing destroyed buildings .
his most famous project to date - the jewish museum in the german capital - opened in september 2001 , more than 60 years after its previous incarnation was destroyed by the nazi regime .
no similarities to museum although both projects deal with memory , libeskind said his design for the wtc replacement is not based on the jewish museum .
" it 's not reminiscent -lrb- of the jewish museum -rrb- although it deals with memory , with how important memory is , with how memory can open itself to something which is positive in the future and not only a skeletal reminder of the event , " he said .
for libeskind , designing buildings was not his first career choice .
after leaving postwar poland for the united states , libeskind first studied music and became a virtuoso pianist in new york .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture in england and new york ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war and conflict in manchester daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities .

busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .

she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .

she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .

it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.02.2003 germany 's unemployment rate hits five-year high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a number : job hunters wait for assistance in frankfurt .
unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .
and officials see no immediate relief in sight . there used to be a time when german chancellor gerhard schröder had high hopes for cutting the country 's unemployment rolls .
he talked of cutting the total to 3.5 million and urged voters to measure his performance by this standard before they went to the polls in 2002 .
his high hopes also once seemed to be shaping up into real gains .
at the end of 2000 , the chancellor looked back on a period in which around 550,000 people joined the working world starting in late 1999 .
and he could look confidently ahead at more gains , fueled by a blend of tax breaks and other measures he had pushed through .
barely two years later , schröder can only look with horror at the numbers .
on wednesday , he and the rest of the country learned that the number of jobless people climbed to 4.623 million in january .
it was the highest figure for the month in five years and a total that amounts to more than the entire population of the eastern german state of saxony .
within a month , the country 's unemployment rate jumped 1 percentage point , to 11.1 percent , as 398,000 people lost their jobs .
slump , weather blamed florian gerster , the head of the german labor office in nürnberg who had the task of spreading the bad news , blamed the increase on the winter weather and the country 's slumping economy .
gerster also offered little hope that the situation would change soon .
instead , he said an improving economy would not help the economy until year 's end .
the numbers sent a shock through the country .
" it is clearly worse than expected , " andreas scheuerle of the dekabank told the reuters news agency .
" those are horrible numbers . "
angela merkel , who leads the opposition christian democratic union , said germany needed a powerful push to overcome the problem .
" and the federal government must provide this powerful push , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wolfgang clement , the social democratic economics and labor minister charged with bringing down the numbers , responded to the report in a more sober language .
" the numbers show that the weak economy and the pressing structural problems continue to have an effect on the economy , " he said . analyzing the problems to holger schäfer of the cologne institute for business research , the growing numbers are nothing new .
for years , economists like him have been analyzing the problems of the german job market and been coming to similar conclusions .
part of the current problem , these economists know , lies beyond the control of the government .
when the economy falls into a slump , employment suffers , schäfer said .
and the german economy has been in the doldrums for two years .
it grew 0.6 percent in 2001 and about 0.2 percent last year , according to the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
the second set of problems , however , has little to do with the ups and downs of a country 's economy .
instead , they are caused by germany 's highly regulated job market , schäfer said .
in this environment , job creation sometimes becomes " the course of last resort , " he said .
one reason that employers are reluctant to hire people is the non-labor costs associated with their employment , he said .
" these costs know only one direction - up , " schäfer said .
the costs , generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employer and employee , cover such things as health insurance and payments into the country 's pension system .
this january , the pension payments climbed from 19.1 percent of gross pay to 19.5 percent .
some officials expect that they will climb once again this year .
many people also are paying higher health insurance premiums as the deficit of the public health funds climbs .
regulations on layoffs beyond these money issues , other regulations make employers reluctant to hire workers , schäfer said .
one such regulation defines procedures that employers must follow when they decide to lay off someone .
among other things , these rules regulate the notification period for layoffs and the payment of severance pay .
in larger companies , employers also must consult the workers ' council , which represents employee interests in a company , before they can lay off workers .
a change in these regulations would allow employers to dismiss employees more easily during bad times , he said .
but " they could hire people more quickly during good times , " schäfer said .
clement , as he noted wednesday , recognizes the need for structural reforms and has suggested relaxing this law to make it easier to dismiss and hire workers .
but he encountered immediate opposition from many of germany 's unions , which are heavily represented in clement 's social democratic party .
in the wake of wednesday 's unemployment report , the head of the german trade union federation continued to raise objections the such ideas .
" i can only advise people to keep their hands off such superficial , knee-jerk reactions , " michael summer said .
change in statistics planned clement is also planning to introduce one sure-fire way to cut the rate : he plans to base germany 's unemployment rate on european union standards .
the centerpiece of the change will be that officials will count only those unemployed people who are available to take jobs .
under germany 's rules , a person is considered to be unemployed if he or she works less than 15 hours a week and is registered with the country 's labor office .
officials said the change was necessary in order to create a universal standard within the european union .
the change is expected to cut the total by more than 1 percentage point . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the reform problems of germany following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems .

busch works for rafaels-werk , a german catholic charity that gives advice to people who want to move away - not just to another city , but to another country . " i got 500-800 enquiries last year .
the berlin office alone , " christina busch told dw-world .
she says the number of requests for information on emigration went up dramatically in 2002 , 50 percent more than the previous year . germans in demand abroad at the same time an increasing number of foreign companies , in search of skilled labor , are making a beeline to germany to lure the best . for instance , about two weeks ago , the zentralstelle für arbeitsvermittlung -lrb- zav -rrb- organised a recruiting drive for four companies from switzerland who were looking for painters , masons , roofers and plumbers .
the employers were particular that the applicants had completed their training and had work experience to show . the zav consultant for the foreign labor market , hans groffebert said that qualified germans were much in demand internationally . " their work organization , qualifications , discipline and their readiness to work hard is treasured , " he told the berliner zeitung . working conditions better abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susann kattelhön of the german medical association too , has noticed a change among doctors .
she works for the organization ’ s foreign service , which advises doctors on having qualifications recognized abroad and ensuring further training will be recognized if they return to germany . “ until now there were comparatively few enquiries , but it is an increasing trend , ” kattelhön admits .
she says the reasons are usually the same : working conditions are better elsewhere . the doctors tend to go to england , the netherlands , scandinavia and france , countries that have a need for medical personnel and actively recruit well-qualified doctors and nurses from abroad .
there the pay is better than in germany , and the working hours are shorter . official statistics belie trend towards going abroad but despite the obvious demand for well-qualified germans abroad , official figures within germany do n't point towards a brain-drain trend in the country . although the german federal statistics office says the amount of people leaving the country has increased from 466,300 in 1980 to 674,000 in 2000 , it says that foreigners made up for the high amount of people turning their backs on germany . the number of germans who moved away actually dropped from 116,400 in 1999 to 109,500 in 2001 , according to the statistics office .
however , that includes all germans who went abroad , whether temporarily or permanently . red tape and lack of friendiness driving germans away although germany ’ s labor and economics minister announced that unemployment reached a five-year high of 4.5 million in january , lack of work is not necessarily what is driving people away . busch also discounts speculation that the political situation is at fault .
" it has nothing to do with the parliamentary elections -lrb- in september -rrb- , " she exclaims .
the wave of interest in emigrating began earlier , she says . many of the people wanting to emigrate go abroad to further their careers , while others are married to a foreigner and plan to move to their spouse ’ s homeland , says busch . one major reason for people wanting to leave germany , according to busch , is the lack of warmth and friendliness in the country . common complaints she hears while counseling people fed up with gemany are , " i feel increasingly uneasy here , it ’ s just not right here anymore , i don ’ t want to be here anymore .
it ’ s too hectic , too stressful , too bureaucratic , ” they tell her . and surprisingly , it ’ s not just foreigners or germans who have spent longer stretches abroad who complain about the “ sozialkälte ” - social coldness - in germany .
busch is reminded of a comment she says sums it up : “ where the grouchy people are - that must be where the plane to germany goes . ” u.s. tops the list busch estimates that two-thirds of the people who seek her out have work .
craftsmen , medical personnel , architects , it specialists and pensioners come looking for advice .
most of them find jobs abroad before they move . at the moment busch is advising a farming family that has decided to sell its stead here to go farm in canada .
“ we ’ re fed up with the bureaucracy , ” the farmers told her . most of busch ’ s clients see the u.s. as the best option , followed by spain , canada , australia and france respectively . whether the german migrants eventually return home is unclear .
both busch and kattelhön have little contact with people who want to return .
dr. kattelhön , however , speaks from her own experience working as an internal specialist abroad .
“ if i had wanted to continue working as a doctor , i would have stayed in switzerland , ” she says . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german coal miners go west the german government ’ s latest strategy to tackle its unemployment rate says workers need to be more mobile .

a survey by the prison reform trust , released in august 2002 , found ashfield had the highest number of assaults on staff and inmates of any prison in the country .
problems at other young offenders ' institutions include suicides , bullying and unsafe conditions for prisoners .
this led the director general of the prison service , martin narey , to ask for his budget to be doubled .
' disgraceful ' regime in 2000 , police were asked to investigate allegations of a 20-year history of abuse of inmates by prison staff at the portland young offenders ' institution in dorset .
the then chief inspector of prisons , sir david ramsbottom , said of the prison : " it appears not to be safe nor am i satisfied that the right staff are working there . "
bullying is a problem at some prisons in march 2001 , sir david condemned another youth jail , brinsford near wolverhampton , as a " disgrace " .
his report into the jail concluded : " brinsford 's regime , with all the indicators we found of self-harm , fear for safety and bullying , puts most of its juvenile population at risk of harm . "
another jail to hit the headlines was the onley young offenders ' institution in warwickshire which was the subject of a year-long inquiry .
there had been a series of complaints by inmates and the new chief inspector , anne owers , said the jail suffered from an " impoverished regime " which was " one of the worst " she had seen .
privatisation row many prison reform groups have argued that privatised prisons have worse standards than those in public control .
however , blakenhurst prison in worcestershire was taken back into public control in 2001 .
a year later , it was described by ms owers as " squalid " and " rife with bullying " .
perhaps the most notorious jail in england is the feltham young offenders ' institute in west london .
a series of initiatives there led to huge improvements but martin narey acknowledged that more needed to be done to bring the system up to an acceptable level .
after a rare favourable report in october 2002 , this time into feltham , he said a doubling of his budget would " provide the care of young people which can really turn their lives around . "

in memory tests , they appear to draw on a particular part of the brain not normally associated with this function .
researchers say the ability of the brain to compensate for the damage done by alzheimer 's does diminish as the disease progresses .
but they say the discovery could point towards treatments which could maintain the compensatory effect .
what that means in real life i 'm not sure dr richard harvey , alzheimer 's society however , uk experts cast doubt on whether the discovery could advance treatment for alzheimer 's disease .
alzheimer 's is an incurable degenerative brain disorder that causes intellectual impairment , disorientation and eventually death .
people in the early stages of the disease experience problems with their episodic memory - of events in their life , such as graduating or a trip to the dentist - and semantic memory , general knowledge such as the names of people or places and major historical events .
tests researchers from the rotman research institute at baycrest centre for geriatric care , in toronto , canada compared 12 healthy elderly people with 11 thought to be in the early stages of alzheimer 's .
each was given quick-fire memory tests on a computer .
in the test of their semantic memory , a word or object appeared on one side of the screen , and a visual noise pattern appeared on the other .
they were asked to decide whether or not the object was living .
the episodic recognition task involved patients being shown two objects or words on screen at the same time , one of which they had seen in the previous task .
they were asked to select which object or word they had seen before .
brain activity was monitored using positron emission tomography -lrb- pet -rrb- , which measures blood flow to various regions of the brain .
overall , alzheimer 's patients performed less well in each test .
but some did better than others .
investigation researchers found that those who did better had more activity in the prefrontal network area of the brain than those who made more errors .
none of the healthy patients showed this pattern of brain activity .
dr cheryl grady , who led the research , said : " we found that patients who were able to recruit the prefrontal cortex of the brain ' to a greater degree ' than other patients , performed more accurately on memory tests .
she added : " the development of compensatory responses in relation to early cognitive changes in alzheimer 's is an area in need of more investigation .
" the goal , until more definitive preventive treatment is found , is to develop more effective treatments that extend this compensatory effect and delay the degenerative effects of alzheimer 's for longer periods . "
real life dr richard harvey , head of research for the uk alzheimer 's society : " this shows that some people with alzheimer 's who have specific tests are able to learn better than others .
" but what that means in real life , i 'm not sure .
" we already know that the brain does compensate when there 's a problem . "
dr harvey said there was a large part of the brain which people did not use in everyday life - the cerebral reserve .
but he added : " as far as i can see , there is no way this research could be developed into treatment . "
the research is published in the journal of neuroscience .

the plan is to shift the high-volume , low-margin side of its two-thirds owned japan telecom subsidiary onto someone else 's shoulders while keeping hold of the more lucrative mobile service , j-phone .
first in the line of suitors is us investment fund ripplewood , japan telecom said on wednesday after a blizzard of news reports suggesting a deal was close .
leading business newspaper the nihon keizai shimbun had reported earlier in the day that the deal could be sealed as early as march , prompting a 7 % rise in japan telecom shares .
gadget lovers japan has been a good market for newbury-based vodafone , at least so far as the mobile business is concerned .
although the takeup rate of expensive third-generation phones has been slow , the japanese are avid users of new services on existing networks .
but japan telecom was a fixed-line company long before it entered the mobile market , and just as japanese number one ntt docomo is seeing more of its profits from broadband , japan telecom 's margins on the landline business are wafer thin .
the company turned in its first ever loss in the year to march 2002 , amounting to 66bn yen -lrb- $ 528.6m ; £ 326m -rrb- , and promptly vowed to do something about the ailing fixed-line business .
internet telephony and the popularity of mobiles has hammered japan 's landline market .
according to the nihon keizai shimbun , the deal could be worth 300bn yen -lrb- $ 2.5bn ; £ 1.5bn -rrb- in cash to vodafone - although the uk company would hold onto debt worth 150bn yen , effectively halving its yield .

an accounts commission report found wide variations between councils , with dundee city doing best and the western isles worst .
the study said 90 % of refuse is still buried in landfill sites .
only 7.4 % of the three million tonnes of household and commercial waste collected by councils in 2001/02 was recycled .
recycling record a target has been set to recycle 25 % of all waste by 2006 dundee city council comes out top , recycling 21.1 % of its waste the western isles comes last , recycling 1.9 % the chairman of the accounts commission attacked councils over their record , saying that they " still have a lot of work to do " .
alastair macnish said : " it is not acceptable for councils to recycle low levels of waste and some councils are nowhere near meeting the target .
" if scotland 's recycling record is to improve , councils need to make recycling easy and convenient . "
the scottish executive has set a target of 25 % of all waste being recycled or composted by 2006 , more than three times the current figure .
to reach this , every council would have to reduce the amount of refuse going to landfill by one tonne per household over the next three years .
the executive has announced funding of almost £ 110m to help achieve these targets .
a spokesman said : " we will shortly be announcing scotland 's first national waste plan , which will provide the framework for reducing the dependence on landfill . "
however , friends of the earth 's -lrb- foe -rrb- head of research , dr dan barlow , said the figures showed that " we are simply not doing enough " .
he said : " we need to see the rapid introduction of doorstep recycling for every household in scotland and the funds made available to allow councils to deliver the types of recycling and composting schemes the public desires . "
figures from foe show that , while scotland recycles less than 8 % of its waste , switzerland recycles 52 % and the netherlands 45 % .

the farcical outcome means he can now kick the entire embarrassing distraction into the long grass . "
there is no consensus on any of the options in the house of commons " mr blair 's spokesman ordinary citizens , on the other hand , could be forgiven for being astonished and dismayed that , after all the talk , mps defeated every one of the eight options in front of them - leaving the issue in an utter shambles .
and it would be a brave or foolhardy punter who would now bet on it being resolved before the next general election .
as one labour backbencher declared , presumably tongue-in-cheek : " we can now dump this mess and leave it to the next tory government to sort out . "
free vote mr blair will also take some pleasure from the fact that leader of the house robin cook 's call for a fully elected chamber was also defeated - albeit by a significantly smaller majority .
mr cook had openly and enthusiastically opposed mr blair 's option and , even though this was a free vote , no prime minister likes that sort of criticism .
so now , the whole issue can be kicked out to a committee charged with the task of coming up with yet another proposal , or set of proposals .
like fox hunting , lords reform has become more trouble than it is worth , and the prime minister already has enough on his plate .
he can argue he has met his manifesto commitment to reform the upper house - even though most voters may have expected something more radical , or even a decision .
and he can , in effect , shrug off all responsibility for what happens to it now .
sleep on it frankly , if he never hears to words " lords reform " ever again he will probably be a happy man .
it has even been suggested that his decision to announce that he favoured a fully appointed chamber was spurred by a desire to muddy the waters .
and it may have worked .
some mps will certainly have used their free vote to back their leader , making it even more difficult to get a clear cut result .
unsurprisingly , the turkeys in the lords did not vote for christmas but decided that , in future , they should be appointed rather than elected .
mr cook probably summed up the overall mood at the end of the pantomime when he declared the best plan would be for mps to go home an have a good night 's sleep before making any further moves on this particular policy .
