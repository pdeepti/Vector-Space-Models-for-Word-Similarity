the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .
we must have different financial routes . the interview was conducted by monika lohmüller . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these sunspots show the coronal mass ejections , or sun storms , that send clouds of charged particles hurtling towards the earth at the speed of light .
power plants from sweden to new jersey cut production in anticipation of energy surges caused when what scientists call coronal mass ejections , or cmes , hit the earth at the speed of light .
the phenomenon can lead to massive blackouts if utility companies do not take the necessary measures to prevent power surges .
under clear skies , the aurora , which are usually only seen at the north pole , were visible as far south as milan , italy .
cmes come around every few years but this one was especially strong .
the x-ray and solar radiation storms rank as the second largest such events recorded in the latest 11-year cycle , according to the noaa .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these sunspots show the coronal mass ejections , or sun storms , that send clouds of charged particles hurtling towards the earth at the speed of light .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.10.2003 germany hints at loosening of stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin floats a trial balloon for a possible change to embryo restrictions .
germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .
the german bishops ' conference , the national catholic leadership body , accused the justice minister of seeking to cast doubt on the human value of an in vitro embryo .
the church reiterated its demand that human dignity be respected at " every stage in human life .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.10.2003 germany hints at loosening of stem cell law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin floats a trial balloon for a possible change to embryo restrictions .
germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .
the german bishops ' conference , the national catholic leadership body , accused the justice minister of seeking to cast doubt on the human value of an in vitro embryo .
the church reiterated its demand that human dignity be respected at " every stage in human life .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these sunspots show the coronal mass ejections , or sun storms , that send clouds of charged particles hurtling towards the earth at the speed of light .
power plants from sweden to new jersey cut production in anticipation of energy surges caused when what scientists call coronal mass ejections , or cmes , hit the earth at the speed of light .
the phenomenon can lead to massive blackouts if utility companies do not take the necessary measures to prevent power surges .
under clear skies , the aurora , which are usually only seen at the north pole , were visible as far south as milan , italy .
cmes come around every few years but this one was especially strong .
the x-ray and solar radiation storms rank as the second largest such events recorded in the latest 11-year cycle , according to the noaa .
germany 's max planck institute says the sun has been more active over the last 60 years than in the previous thousand .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these sunspots show the coronal mass ejections , or sun storms , that send clouds of charged particles hurtling towards the earth at the speed of light .
power plants from sweden to new jersey cut production in anticipation of energy surges caused when what scientists call coronal mass ejections , or cmes , hit the earth at the speed of light .
the phenomenon can lead to massive blackouts if utility companies do not take the necessary measures to prevent power surges .
under clear skies , the aurora , which are usually only seen at the north pole , were visible as far south as milan , italy .
cmes come around every few years but this one was especially strong .
the x-ray and solar radiation storms rank as the second largest such events recorded in the latest 11-year cycle , according to the noaa .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .

it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these sunspots show the coronal mass ejections , or sun storms , that send clouds of charged particles hurtling towards the earth at the speed of light .
power plants from sweden to new jersey cut production in anticipation of energy surges caused when what scientists call coronal mass ejections , or cmes , hit the earth at the speed of light .
the phenomenon can lead to massive blackouts if utility companies do not take the necessary measures to prevent power surges .
under clear skies , the aurora , which are usually only seen at the north pole , were visible as far south as milan , italy .
cmes come around every few years but this one was especially strong .
the x-ray and solar radiation storms rank as the second largest such events recorded in the latest 11-year cycle , according to the noaa .
germany 's max planck institute says the sun has been more active over the last 60 years than in the previous thousand .

not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .
we must have different financial routes . the interview was conducted by monika lohmüller . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .

the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .
the german bishops ' conference , the national catholic leadership body , accused the justice minister of seeking to cast doubt on the human value of an in vitro embryo .

a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .
the german bishops ' conference , the national catholic leadership body , accused the justice minister of seeking to cast doubt on the human value of an in vitro embryo .
the church reiterated its demand that human dignity be respected at " every stage in human life .

the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .

besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .
the german bishops ' conference , the national catholic leadership body , accused the justice minister of seeking to cast doubt on the human value of an in vitro embryo .
the church reiterated its demand that human dignity be respected at " every stage in human life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 14 years of german unification opinion : a progress report on german unity communism sunk by the hunk in trunks ? dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules has rebuilding east germany failed ? business -pipe- 30.10.2003 solbes blames reunification for german economic woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu economy will recover slightly in 2004 , but no end of the misery is in sight for germany .
europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .
we must have different financial routes . the interview was conducted by monika lohmüller . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .
we must have different financial routes . the interview was conducted by monika lohmüller . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .
we must have different financial routes . the interview was conducted by monika lohmüller . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these sunspots show the coronal mass ejections , or sun storms , that send clouds of charged particles hurtling towards the earth at the speed of light .
power plants from sweden to new jersey cut production in anticipation of energy surges caused when what scientists call coronal mass ejections , or cmes , hit the earth at the speed of light .
the phenomenon can lead to massive blackouts if utility companies do not take the necessary measures to prevent power surges .
under clear skies , the aurora , which are usually only seen at the north pole , were visible as far south as milan , italy .
cmes come around every few years but this one was especially strong .
the x-ray and solar radiation storms rank as the second largest such events recorded in the latest 11-year cycle , according to the noaa .

rau and his polish counterpart , aleksander kwasniewski , issued a joint statement in gdansk , poland , on wednesday , in which they called for a spirit of reconciliation and friendship .
rau criticized the ongoing discussion about building a documentation in berlin center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.10.2003 boosting confidence in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economy minister wolfgang clement gave deutsche welle an exclusive interview .
the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .

the german government 's reform plans are supposed to spur the struggling economy , encourage job creation and consumer spending .
but there 's no way to avoid sacrifices , clement told deutsche welle . a graying population , low birth rate and record unemployment are weighing down on germany 's economy . health , pensions and welfare systems are all teetering on the brink of collapse . making things worse , germany has the unfortunate status of being the slowest growing economy in the entire euro zone . with his " agenda 2010 " plan of lower taxes , structural reforms and social system cuts , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to breath life into the economy .
the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , approved some of the measures in mid-october , but they still must be passed by the upper chamber , the opposition-controlled bundesrat , before they become law .
even then there 's no guarantee they will give the german economy the kick start it needs . deutsche welle spoke to economy and labor minister wolfgang clement about the challenges facing germany .
you have said that everyone in germany underestimated the situation the country was in , and now serious changes are urgently needed .
what must be done ? we all failed for years to rationally analyze the need for renewal , and we did n't draw the consequences .
we have experienced continually declining growth in recent years and now , during a difficult phase worldwide , we have had three years of stagnation … what must be done ?
besides the things that naturally play a much more important role - that world trade develops as forecast , that the economy gets stronger in the united states , in central and eastern europe , in china and in the southeastern asian states - we need a monetary policy here in europe that accompanies that prudently . but we have to continue to implement our reform measures ourselves , and for that to happen the government and the opposition in germany need to cooperate .
we must lower taxes and non-wage labor costs , restructure the labor market , the healthcare system , the pensions system .
a comprehensive reorganization or modernization is necessary , and the necessary laws are already on the table . the bills will only become law if the opposition approves them in the bundesrat .
will it allow the government to begin implementing the reform legislation starting from january 1 , as planned ?
is n't time running out ? no , i do n't think so … i assume everyone knows that it is of the utmost importance for building confidence that the most important laws are in force on january 1 - that is , the tax reforms , the tax reductions , … the municipal finance reforms , since we also need municipal investments , especially for small- and medium-sized businesses .
the healthcare system reforms will surely be in force by then .
the pension system reform - the acute measures above all - must be in force and the labor market legislation as well .
we still have the trades legislation and similar things relating to it to free up forces in germany . we need investment and we need citizens who go shopping again .
we need things to reassure us , and we need a bit more confidence .
then we will get the economy going und slowly but surely see a positive development in the labor market . people will have to pay more for healthcare , pensions will be frozen and unemployment benefits will be cut .
all the same , you still expect the national economy to improve ? yes , i do .
not everyone will be effected by the measures equally , but all taxpayers will be effected by lower taxes .
we 're taking the lowest tax bracket down 15 points and raising the exemption limit .
a family with two children and a yearly income of up to € 35,000 -lrb- $ 40,900 -rrb- wo n't have to pay taxes anymore .
we 're talking about substantial tax relief that includes the top tax bracket - which will be at 42 percent .
it applies to everyone who pays taxes , while pensions or healthcare do n't effect citizens across the board . we know there are victims , that we are asking for sacrifices ...
there 's just no avoiding it .
everyone knows that in reality the economic situation is not only to blame , but the demographic situation as well .
we ca n't finance the pensions system or the healthcare system like we did 30 or 40 years ago anymore … we age 10 , 15 , up to 20 years more than 30 or 40 years ago , and we must adapt the social welfare systems accordingly .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .
the german bishops ' conference , the national catholic leadership body , accused the justice minister of seeking to cast doubt on the human value of an in vitro embryo .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .

germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . in a speech at berlin 's humboldt university on wednesday , zypries said that embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists , and added that lawmakers should ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations on the use of embryos in research are too strict . when parliament passed germany 's law on stem cell research in april 2002 , it prompted a huge ethical debate in the bundestag .
the result was a compromise : the law states research on stem cells is only allowed if they were imported and created before january 1 , 2002 . when does life begin ? in her speech , zypries , a social democrat , challenged another area of german law on the protection of embryos , which states that human life begins at the moment of conception .
zypries ' predecessor , herta däubler-gmelin , consistently defended this position , which proponents of genetic technology say restricts embryonic research and progress on in-vitro fertilization -lrb- ivf -rrb- . an embryo created in a petri dish currently enjoys the same protection as an embryo inside the womb .
but zypries ' view is that as long as the embryo is in vitro , it lacks the necessary conditions to develop into a human being . the abstract possibility of further development is not sufficient to guarantee protection of human rights , the minister said . " we ca n't find the ' right ' answers to the questions of biomedicine simply by looking them up in our basic law , " zypries said .
" instead , we have to make the effort , for each issue that arises , to carefully analyze and weigh the opportunities and the risks of biomedicine . " the justice minister 's speech could signal a shift in the stance of the german government on stem cell research .
a spokesman for gerhard schröder said the chancellor supported a discussion over whether the boundaries set in the current law go too far . conservative approach zypries ' opinions suggest a new basic understanding by the government on questions of bioethics and , especially , the use of embryos in medical research . but rather than advising an immediate lifting of the current restrictions , she opted for a more conservative approach . contrary to previous statements , she said she opposed in principle the use of pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- . the procedure is designed to help parents with the risk of passing on genetic diseases to their offspring by doing tests on embryos before they are implanted in the womb .
only those embryos considered not at risk of developing the disease are implanted , the others are discarded . zypries explained her rejection of pid by arguing that no one has the right to decide which lives are worthy of living . she advised couples wishing to use pid to instead choose , " as hard as it may be , " to not have biological children . the justice minister also said she was against therapeutic cloning of embryos for the harvesting of stem cells since , in this case , embryos are created with the knowledge that they will be destroyed . more permissible , in her view , is the use of " leftover " embryos that are created for ivf but are not implanted in the womb . church , politicians condemn speech the suggestion that the government might loosen the stem cell law in the coming months drew criticism from many quarters . maria böhmer , deputy chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union 's parliamentary group , warned the government not to create any leeway in a law intended to protect human dignity , saying any effort to loosen the law threatened to transform " embryos from people to material . " meanwhile , the deputy chairman of the green 's parliamentary group , reinhard loske , said the law needed " in no way to be amended , " arguing that the existing supply of stem cells in germany was sufficient for research needs . germany 's roman catholic also criticized zypries ' speech .
the german bishops ' conference , the national catholic leadership body , accused the justice minister of seeking to cast doubt on the human value of an in vitro embryo .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .
next tuesday , the european economic and finance ministers will determine which , if any , penalty measures are to be taken . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback will germany once again escape the wrath of the eu or will the sick man of europe finally get punished as the rules dictate ?

the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .
previously , the commission had blamed the country 's restrictive labor market , high unemployment and inability in recent years to push through needed structural reforms for the swollen deficit .
solbes ’ forecast noted that germany is not expected to fully profit from an forecasted upturn in the eu economy next year .
he also expects the country ’ s unemployment rate to continue rising into 2005 , a trend that will lead to expensive social outlays that will make a balanced budget difficult and decrease confidence among consumers and businesses .
germany ’ s tight budget is also leading to a reduction in public investment , he warned .
brussels calls for reforms noting berlin ’ s dire economic situation , solbes encouraged germans to push through an ambitious package of structural reforms now working its way through parliament and the country ’ s upper legislative chamber .
only with the passage of structural reforms will german be able to bring its budget in line with the stability and growth pact , which guarantees the secure course of the euro , solbes cautioned .
for next year , the eu is forecasting a german budget deficit of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product , a figure that far exceeds the three percent permitted under the european stability pact .
the german government recently conceded that its budget deficit for 2003 would exceed four percent .
" we assume that , despite their efforts , france , germany and portugal will continue to break this reference value , " solbes said .
the eu report also warned that italy is also on track to violate the deficit limit in 2005 .
the commission said it was also concerned about the greek and dutch budget positions .
key leaders call for easing of pact euro zone member states introduced the growth and stability pact as part of the maastricht treaty in order to ensure the stability of the common european currency , the euro .
more recently , the viability of the pact , crafted by german and france , has come into question .
just last week , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the three percent ceiling should not be seen as " an absolute " restriction . berlusconi 's statement echoed previous calls in recent months by german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac for a looser interpretation of the stability pact .
solbes , however , insisted that the eu would not stray from the stability pact .
" the commission doesn ’ t have any intention of changing the pact .
we want to maintain it as it is , " he said .
by breaking the stability pact for a third consecutive time in 2004 , germany could face serious consequences , including billions of euros in penalties , though the commission has not indicated it would push for such grave action .

europe ’ s commissioner for monetary affairs warns that germany is in danger of breaking euro zone rules again in 2004 and 2005 , but concedes that the problems have been fueled by the merging of east and west germany . germany ’ s weak growth remains a serious problem for the european union .
not only will germany break the eu ’ s deficit spending cap of three percent in 2004 for the third time in a row , it will also lag behind the rest of europe in economic growth .
in his latest report released on wednesday , pedro solbes said he expected the eu ’ s total economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2004 .
however , germany will only attain growth of 1.6 percent during that period .
according to the commissioner , limited gains in germany , the eu ’ s largest single economy , will also put a drag on growth throughout the euro zone .
" there was , this year , one big country , germany , which had very weak growth .
we know the causes - among them the costs of reunification , " he said .
" there is also weak growth in italy , but above all we see the problem in germany and france . "
the commissioner 's admission that the reunification of east and west germany has contributed to economic woes is likely to take some pressure off of the federal government in berlin .

the defendant , abdelghani mzoudi , was still suspected of having aided several of the suicide hijackers in preparing the 9/11 attacks , the judge said .
mzoudi 's defense lawyers had petitioned for his release after a government intelligence official told the court last week that the terrorist attacks were planned in afghanistan .
the defense argued that the case against mzoudi was based on evidence that the attacks were planned in hamburg , and thus it should be dropped .

one of the biggest solar storms in recent years hits the earth 's magnetic field , generating spectacular northern lights and scrambling satellite communications . the ufo hotline in mannheim , germany , was inundated with calls as concerned skywatchers rang up to report strange lights on the horizon .
what they were seeing was no alien invasion , but the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights which are generated when charged particles from the sun interfere with the earth 's magnetic field .
while the storms can have a major impact on some high-tech devices , scientists say they are harmless to human beings .
" there are people who really worry about these things , but there is absolultely no cause for concern .
a sunstorm is practically irrelevant to humans " , said the president of the german society for environmental medicine , professor claus piekarski , in an interview with the german news agency dpa .
satellite data scrambled the solar storms , which are expected to continue for another day or two , temporarily interfered with communications systems and satellites had to be switched to stand-by mode .
some airline passengers had to put up with delays because aviation safety agencies took the precaution of cutting back on traffic volume as radar and radio communications were hit .
planes disappeared from radar screens for seconds at a time , but aviation experts said that at no stage were passengers at risk . the u.s. national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 's -lrb- noaa -rrb- space environment center in boulder , colorado said the sun unleashed a cloud of charged particles 13 times the size of planet earth .
the cosmic rays were so intense that transmissions by the european space agency 's soho satellite , the german satellite champ and the nasa satellite ace all failed temporarily .
gps briefly disoriented the u.s. global positioning system , or gps , sporadically delivered inaccurate or incomplete data , according to frank jansen , director of the space weather institute in the german town of greifswald .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these sunspots show the coronal mass ejections , or sun storms , that send clouds of charged particles hurtling towards the earth at the speed of light .
power plants from sweden to new jersey cut production in anticipation of energy surges caused when what scientists call coronal mass ejections , or cmes , hit the earth at the speed of light .
the phenomenon can lead to massive blackouts if utility companies do not take the necessary measures to prevent power surges .
under clear skies , the aurora , which are usually only seen at the north pole , were visible as far south as milan , italy .
cmes come around every few years but this one was especially strong .
the x-ray and solar radiation storms rank as the second largest such events recorded in the latest 11-year cycle , according to the noaa .
germany 's max planck institute says the sun has been more active over the last 60 years than in the previous thousand .

the number of post-war deaths rose to 115 following the killing of two soldiers north of baghdad .
the pentagon says 114 us soldiers were killed by hostile fire during the war .
us officials said the latest victims were soldiers of the 4th infantry division , who died when an explosive device was detonated as their convoy passed by .
a row has also erupted over mr bush 's actual speech on 1 may , which he made aboard an aircraft carrier after a dramatic landing on the deck .
us death toll in iraq 114 deaths in combat up to 1 may 115 killed in hostile incidents since 1 may 79 us deaths in 1991 gulf war in pictures : bush 's carrier speech behind him on that day was a banner proclaiming " mission accomplished " and , earlier this week , the president said it had all been the idea of the ship 's crew .
however , the white house now says it helped produce the banner .
the issue may seem trivial but , the bbc 's rob watson reports from washington , it has been leapt on by critics who argue the bush administration never really prepared the american people for just how bloody the post-war phase might be .
iraqi losses the bbc 's jonny dymond in baghdad says attacks against us forces have ebbed and flowed since major hostilities officially ended on 1 may , but every week has brought some fatalities .
bush compared suicide bombings in iraq to the 11 september attacks our correspondent says the deaths of us and british troops receive much publicity , but iraqis have been killed in far greater numbers .
according to findings by independent us researchers made available this week , about 13,000 iraqis , including as many as 4,300 civilians , were killed during the major combat phase of the war .
our correspondent says there are no official figures for how many iraqis are currently killed every day .
however , one assessment based on the number of bodies coming into baghdad 's morgue suggests that just over 1,500 deaths are attributable to the breakdown in law and order since the fall of the old regime .
bush defiant on tuesday , president bush said the united states would not be intimidated by those trying to create a " climate of fear " in iraq .
the president drew a parallel between recent suicide bombings in iraq and the 11 september 2001 attacks in the united states .
" it 's the same mentality , " mr bush said .
" we 'll just destroy innocent life and watch the united states and their friends and allies , you know , crater in the face of hardship . "
president bush said the us was " constantly looking at the enemy " and adjusting its response accordingly .
he said the us would set up more blockades and inspections and seek to give iraqis a bigger role in intelligence-gathering to thwart attacks .
analysts said mr bush 's words appeared intended to address criticism that the white house had failed to anticipate rising violence in iraq and was uncertain about how to deal with it and protect american lives .

the senate voted against the privatisation bill by a majority of 34 to 26 on thursday .
ministers have said the government plans to reintroduce the bill within three months but may call an early election if the senate rejects it again .
the planned sale of the government 's 50.1 % stake in telstra would have been australia 's biggest ever privatisation , expected to raise about a $ 35bn -lrb- $ 23bn ; £ 14.5bn -rrb- .
rural anger opponents of the sale argue it could result in poorer services in rural and outback areas of australia , where telstra is often the only telephone operator .
supporters say it would make the company more competitive , and remove the conflict between the government as regulator and owner .
treasurer peter costello said the issues had been fully debated and that the government would resubmit the bill .
" the australian government will be calling on the senate , yes , to pass its legislation , " said mr costello , who is the ruling liberal party 's designated successor to prime minister john howard .
poll option finance minister nick minchin said a second rejection could spark an election as it would be " a double dissolution trigger " .
australia 's constitution gives the government the option of calling an early election if the senate rejects a bill twice .
it it won , it would then be permitted to hold a joint sitting of both houses of parliament to push through the disputed legislation .
the telstra privatisation bill has already passed the lower house , where the government has a majority .
four independent senators voted against it .

the new report rates countries on various measures of business competitiveness .
in the key global competitiveness category , finland has overtaken the united states as the country which has the best climate for economic growth .
and five northern european countries are represented in the top 10 , while only taiwan and singapore are from asia .
the new ratings may reflect a change in the way the scale was constructed , which gave less weight to the size of the public sector and more weight to the perceptions of honest government when considering the quality of public institutions .
" if there is one lesson to be drawn from our report , it is that the strength and coherence of government policies have an enormous bearing on a country 's ranking , " said augusto lopez-claros , chief economist of the world economic forum .
public institutions the united kingdom and canada both slipped down in the ratings to 15th and 16th place , due to a perceived drop in the quality of their public institutions .
this also affected china , which fell to 44th place , from 33rd place last year .
the survey includes 102 countries , with most of the developing world ranking at the bottom .
ranking : growth competitiveness 1 .
finland 2 .
usa 3 .
sweden 4 .
denmark 5 .
taiwan 6 .
singapore 7 .
switzerland 8 .
iceland 9 .
norway 10 .
australia the lowest ranking countries for competitiveness were zimbabwe , bangladesh , chad , mali , and haiti .

in one of the worst atrocities of the northern ireland troubles , two gunmen from the ulster freedom fighters opened fire on the rising sun bar at greysteel , county londonderry in october 1993 .
they shot dead seven people , both men and women .
another man later died of his injuries .
it was an act of retaliation for the ira 's bombing on the shankill road in west belfast just days earlier , in which 10 people , including one of the bombers , were killed .
customers at first thought it was a halloween prank as the gunmen shouted " trick or treat " before opening fire on the bar .
you ca n't help but think about that night and it does bring back memories which are very vivid adrian mcauley paramedic adrian mcauley of the northern ireland ambulance service , who was a paramedic on duty the night of the killings , said the anniversary was poignant .
" we knew it was a shooting , but we did n't know the numbers of casualties and when we walked inside and looked round , it looked like there were just bodies everywhere , " he said .
" it does n't actually seem like 10 years .
in this sort of job you do n't really spend a lot of time lingering on the things that have happened .
you face a lot of trauma , day in and day out .
" but on the tenth anniversary , and with it being in the papers and television , you ca n't help but think about that night and it does bring back memories which are very vivid . "
three people were convicted in connection with the greysteel killings but were later granted early release from prison under the terms of the 1998 good friday agreement .

the mersey tunnels bill will now be sent on to the house of lords after mps voted in favour on wednesday .
merseytravel - the body which runs the tunnels - says it needs the powers to raise tolls in order to fund improvements .
it says the money raised would also pay for other projects including public transport across the merseyside region .
but the bill was attacked by many merseyside mps , including birkenhead 's frank field who said it was " outrageous " that merseytravel would be able to use extra revenue raised on tunnel tolls to subsidise other local transport .
safety standards opponents have also warned it could give the green light for substantial year-on-year increases .
john mcgoldrick , from the pressure group mersey tunnels users group , said tolls should be going down rather than up .
" we have had tolls since the tunnels opened in 1934 , " he said .
" we believe the amount they already collect is sufficient that they should be able to reduce tolls , and perhaps even make them free at weekends . "
but supporters of the bill say increasing the toll would help bring the tunnels up to european safety standards .

the mersey tunnels bill will now be sent on to the house of lords after mps voted in favour on wednesday .
merseytravel - the body which runs the tunnels - says it needs the powers to raise tolls in order to fund improvements .
it says the money raised would also pay for other projects including public transport across the merseyside region .
but the bill was attacked by many merseyside mps , including birkenhead 's frank field who said it was " outrageous " that merseytravel would be able to use extra revenue raised on tunnel tolls to subsidise other local transport .
safety standards opponents have also warned it could give the green light for substantial year-on-year increases .
john mcgoldrick , from the pressure group mersey tunnels users group , said tolls should be going down rather than up .
" we have had tolls since the tunnels opened in 1934 , " he said .
" we believe the amount they already collect is sufficient that they should be able to reduce tolls , and perhaps even make them free at weekends . "
but supporters of the bill say increasing the toll would help bring the tunnels up to european safety standards .

private consultants are expected to be appointed shortly by the scottish executive to negotiate the removal of the charges .
it is hoped they can agree a deal which would allow the contract for the tolls to be bought out .
the skye bridge has been the subject of controversy since it opened in october 1995 .
more than £ 27m has been collected from drivers and protesters argue the bridge has paid for itself many times over .
in a letter to the highland msp john farquhar munro , the transport minister nicol stephen has confirmed that independent consultants are to meet management from the skye bridge company .
mr farquhar munro said he is hopeful a solution will be found by christmas .
tolls for crossing the bridge are currently set at £ 5.70 one-way for a car in the summer and £ 4.70 in the winter .

after the collapse of itv digital last year the short-term prospects for digital tv through an aerial in the uk looked bleak .
bskyb 's satellite service , with hundreds of channels , was enjoying rude health with well over five million users .
but the supposedly simpler itv digital alternative , where viewers picked up a smaller number of pay-tv channels through their aerial , was deemed to be an inferior rival .
its 40-or-so channels were overshadowed by the 500 on sky , and it was finally crippled by a costly deal to cover the football league , one which most of its 1.2 million subscribers showed little interest in .
but six months later , the old itv digital boxes crackled back into life thanks to freeview .
freeview offered viewers the chance to pick up a basic set of 30 channels without having to sign up for a monthly subscription .
all they had to do was buy a box for £ 100 .
freeview facts freeview viewers can recieve digital tv through their regular aerials all they need is a decoder box , or a specially-adapted tv its backers are the bbc , bskyb and transmitter company crown castle it can now be seen in more than two million homes at least 1.4m are new freeview households around 600,000 use the old itv digital boxes source : freeview now , a year later , 2.1m homes are watching freeview .
many are still watching through old itv digital equipment .
but freeview boxes are selling well , with executives saying 24,000 boxes are being sold each week .
some analysts believe that number could double again in the next year .
channels on offer include bbc three , bbc four , itv2 , sky news , uk history and music and shopping services .
the list is set to grow .
earlier this month disney announced it was launching an entertainment channel which would appear in the winter . £ 80 boxes channel 4 is also said to be preparing an entertainment channel - much like its pay-tv service e4 - to launch on freeview next year .
set-top boxes cost as little as £ 80 now - and the price of the cheapest boxes could fall to as low as £ 20 in the future .
some commentators believe freeview has attracted tv viewers who would never have considered paying to for services such as sky .
gordon macmillan , editor of uk media website brand republic , said : " with two million homes signed up to freeview , the service has exceeded expectations and it does it at a very affordable price .
" testament to its success is easy to find .
you just have to look at disney 's decision recently to launch on the free-to-air service .
" the only thing that is surprising is sky holding off launching its own entertainment channel on the system .
that looks like a missed opportunity . "
freeview general manager matthew seaman told bbc news online he is looking to add new channels as soon as possible .
but he said freeview was still trying to come to terms with its first 12 months .
' more choice ' " after the collapse of itv digital , people thought digital terrestrial television would n't even survive , " he said .
" we needed to regain the confidence of the consumers , the industry and manufacturers . "
he added : " sales have surpassed even our most optimistic forecasts - even at the height of summer - and we 're really hopeful about sales this christmas . "
there are now 99 different boxes which can be used to receive freeview , from set-top boxes to interactive pcs and dvd players with freeview installed .
" we 're finding that people are not just buying freeview at the normal electronic stores , they are buying them at supermarkets and other stores , " said mr seaman .
" it 's attracting people who do not want to pay a monthly fee for their tv , but they do want more choice . "
freeview 's range of channels is still too limited for some .
" there is not enough quality general entertainment programming , and i think there is too much reliance on music and news , " said ian darby , media editor of advertising trade magazine campaign .
" they might have to extend it a bit , because there is weakness in their programming . "
but mr darby said freeview 's rapidly rising viewing figures would only make the service more attractive to broadcasters wanting to put their channels on the system .
" if it really does have more than four million households by the end of next year then you may see the serious contenders like sky deciding to put more channels on - even sky one , " he explained .
" that could be the next stage of their evolution . "

the decision by the billionaire owner of bhs and arcadia leaves bradford-based grocer morrisons with a clear run to acquire rival safeway .
a competition commission inquiry last month excluded larger rivals tesco , asda and j sainsbury from the bid race .
morrisons is expected to announce a new formal bid in the next few weeks .
its original offer - worth £ 2.9bn at the time - was 1.32 morrisons shares for each safeway share but that lapsed after safeway decided to consider other suitors .
a bid from mr green had been exempted from the competition inquiry because he has no interests in the grocery sector .
announcing his withdrawal , he said his bid team had undertaken " detailed analysis " of the safeway business and held discussions with the office of fair trading over the details of the competition commission inquiry .
frenzied activity in a statement from his bid vehicle trackdean investments , he said : " following advice from its professional advisers , trackdean has now decided not to proceed with an offer for safeway . "
the owner of high street stores including top shop , dorothy perkins and bhs had in january expressed an interest in buying safeway .
he stepped in during a frenzied period of activity in the supermarket sector after morrisons ' £ 2.9bn offer for safeway 's 479 stores .
a spokesman for safeway said : " we have noted that philip green has decided not to issue an offer . "
other expressions of interest followed the morrisons offer .
but trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt agreed with the competition watchdog 's view that a takeover by any of the big three retailers would " operate against the public interest at both a local and national level " .
profit warning that ruling preventing tesco , sainsbury 's and asda from acquiring any safeway stores in the near future may have made a bid less attractive for mr green , analysts say .
henk potts , of barclays stockbrokers , said : " it 's likely he would have wanted to reduce some of the cost of taking over safeway by selling off the unwanted stores to the likes of tesco .
" the competition commission has effectively stopped him doing that , so taking away some of the economic benefit of the deal . "
on wednesday safeway warned that its half-year earnings were set to slip .
it said underlying pre-tax profits would be around £ 173m for the first-half of 2003 , down from £ 187m a year earlier .
chief executive carlos criado-perez said the firm 's performance had been stable in the face of 10 months of uncertainty over safeway 's future .
