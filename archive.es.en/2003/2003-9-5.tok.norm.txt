german editorialists reflect on rau ’ s performance and offer up mixed reviews . the süddeutsche zeitung had only praise for rau in its friday edition .
" rau carried out his job as president smartly and pleasantly , " the editors wrote .
" rau always wanted to serve a second term .
but the times didn ’ t co- operate with him .
at his age , he has to think about the risk to his health .
and politically , he has to think about the risk that he might get voted down .
we wish that his respectable performance could have been recognized across party lines , with an extension into a second term . "
but the lausitzer rundschau newspaper in cottbus offered a more critical perspective .
" anybody who has observed johannes rau in the last few months has got to wonder if five more years would have been good for the 72-year-old man , " the paper wrote .
" but he himself didn ’ t recognize this fact , and gave the impression that he was nurturing further political hopes .
this throws a kind of shadow over an otherwise generally respectable presidency .

commenting on the meeting , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " france isn ’ t actually refusing to help militarily in the peacekeeping , stabilizing and rebuilding of iraq .
but france is putting big conditions on that help .
the german government , on the other hand , has completely refused to provide any military help .
berlin is sticking by its previous statements , but paris is giving itself room to maneuver and is open to negotiation .
there ’ s no difference in substance here ; but the differences in tactics show that the germans and the french don ’ t have the same interests in iraq . "
according to the editors of cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , " gerhard schroeder and jacques chirac are taking a clear political stand .
they are calling for an ‘ iraqisation ’ of the government in baghdad , to get rid of the impression that iraq is being occupied .

with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "
he added that a " forgotten country " was more appropriate than a " powerful one " like germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .

under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "

in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "
he added that a " forgotten country " was more appropriate than a " powerful one " like germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 will hutton inquiry leave a political body trail ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord hutton warned that no party to the inquiry is safe from criticism .
the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

german editorialists reflect on rau ’ s performance and offer up mixed reviews . the süddeutsche zeitung had only praise for rau in its friday edition .
" rau carried out his job as president smartly and pleasantly , " the editors wrote .
" rau always wanted to serve a second term .
but the times didn ’ t co- operate with him .
at his age , he has to think about the risk to his health .
and politically , he has to think about the risk that he might get voted down .
we wish that his respectable performance could have been recognized across party lines , with an extension into a second term . "
but the lausitzer rundschau newspaper in cottbus offered a more critical perspective .
" anybody who has observed johannes rau in the last few months has got to wonder if five more years would have been good for the 72-year-old man , " the paper wrote .
" but he himself didn ’ t recognize this fact , and gave the impression that he was nurturing further political hopes .
this throws a kind of shadow over an otherwise generally respectable presidency .
now that rau has announced he ’ s leaving , the gates are open for nominations . "
in other topics , the new proposal from the united states for a resolution on iraq has sparked heated commentary .
die welt , a newspaper from berlin , wrote that " even the toughest critics of american political decisions have to admit that george w. bush is going right up to the united nations and changing the previous plan .

but now the tide has turned .
now that gis are coming home in body bags and the costs of the iraq adventure are climbing into astronomical figures , washington is looking for the support of the world community .
it ’ s a declaration of bankruptcy .
the superpower has overextended itself .
this embarrassing confession is also a personal low point for george w. bush .
it puts him under unavoidable pressure in the current race for the white house . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met thursday and discussed the possibility of putting more european soldiers in iraq .
commenting on the meeting , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " france isn ’ t actually refusing to help militarily in the peacekeeping , stabilizing and rebuilding of iraq .
but france is putting big conditions on that help .
the german government , on the other hand , has completely refused to provide any military help .
berlin is sticking by its previous statements , but paris is giving itself room to maneuver and is open to negotiation .
there ’ s no difference in substance here ; but the differences in tactics show that the germans and the french don ’ t have the same interests in iraq . "
according to the editors of cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , " gerhard schroeder and jacques chirac are taking a clear political stand .
they are calling for an ‘ iraqisation ’ of the government in baghdad , to get rid of the impression that iraq is being occupied .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .

and doggie makes four german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife have a new member of the family : a puppy .
holly , a pure breed border terrier , was delivered to the schröder 's home in hannover by dog breeders from the german state of lower saxony .
" we considered for over a year whether we wanted a dog and , if so , what breed , " chancellor schröder told the celebrity gossip magazine bunte .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "

the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .

schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 will hutton inquiry leave a political body trail ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord hutton warned that no party to the inquiry is safe from criticism .
the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

"
a new research-based institute opens in essen dedicated to studying the threats of global terrorism . the institute for research on terrorism and security policy -lrb- iftus -rrb- has been set up to offer information on terrorism to a wider public as well as analyzing just how bad the global terrorist threat really is . the institute is to be headed up by one of germany 's top terrorism experts , rolf tophoven , and will provide associations , private customers and businesses with information and advice on understanding militant terrorism . no clear and present danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven tophoven -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had a stint at the end of the 1980s as the deputy head of bonn 's institute for terrorism research , told deutsche welle at the institute 's opening ceremony on thursday that germany was not in clear and present danger from the global terrorist threat , but the risk of attack was still there . " germany is not first in the firing line for international terrorists , " he said .
" the usa , great britain as well as other countries involved in the war on iraq are more at risk , as well as jewish and israeli interests .
but there are certainly jewish and israeli interests in germany , and it is here where there is a risk . " however , tophoven said , there is a high " abstract danger " to germans and added it was likely german tourists would be targeted again , as was the case with the recently released adventure tourists taken hostage by islamic militants in the sahara desert . tophoven said recent car bomb attacks in post-saddam hussein iraq confirmed how necessary a basic analysis of terrorism and its threat has become .
above all , he said , it is necessary to have a clear picture of the enemy the world is now dealing with . " i am absolutely certain that what the americans are currently experiencing in iraq is the result of a poor understanding of the ideology behind islamic terrorism , " he said .
" any regime can be taken out with tanks and aircraft warfare .
but what comes afterwards is another matter .
it 's necessary to recognize the structure of militant islam . " engaging with the terrorist threat as well as engaging in top-flight research in the coming months , iftus will also provide interested parties with seminars and day courses as well as a quarterly newsletter .
that will pick up on the main issues of security policy as well as focusing on current terrorism-related news . tophoven has a few questions he 'd like to pose the institute himself . " what sort of defense mechanisms can free democratic societies create to ensure that our citizens are protected , but also ensure that their rights are not limited ?
and what are the chances of being able to predict future terrorist attacks ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .

they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .

the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .

in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .

they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "
he added that a " forgotten country " was more appropriate than a " powerful one " like germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .

at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

" the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "

with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" rau carried out his job as president smartly and pleasantly , " the editors wrote .
" rau always wanted to serve a second term .

at his age , he has to think about the risk to his health .
and politically , he has to think about the risk that he might get voted down .

but the lausitzer rundschau newspaper in cottbus offered a more critical perspective .
" anybody who has observed johannes rau in the last few months has got to wonder if five more years would have been good for the 72-year-old man , " the paper wrote .
" but he himself didn ’ t recognize this fact , and gave the impression that he was nurturing further political hopes .

commenting on the meeting , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " france isn ’ t actually refusing to help militarily in the peacekeeping , stabilizing and rebuilding of iraq .

"
a new research-based institute opens in essen dedicated to studying the threats of global terrorism . the institute for research on terrorism and security policy -lrb- iftus -rrb- has been set up to offer information on terrorism to a wider public as well as analyzing just how bad the global terrorist threat really is . the institute is to be headed up by one of germany 's top terrorism experts , rolf tophoven , and will provide associations , private customers and businesses with information and advice on understanding militant terrorism . no clear and present danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven tophoven -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had a stint at the end of the 1980s as the deputy head of bonn 's institute for terrorism research , told deutsche welle at the institute 's opening ceremony on thursday that germany was not in clear and present danger from the global terrorist threat , but the risk of attack was still there . " germany is not first in the firing line for international terrorists , " he said .
" the usa , great britain as well as other countries involved in the war on iraq are more at risk , as well as jewish and israeli interests .
but there are certainly jewish and israeli interests in germany , and it is here where there is a risk . " however , tophoven said , there is a high " abstract danger " to germans and added it was likely german tourists would be targeted again , as was the case with the recently released adventure tourists taken hostage by islamic militants in the sahara desert . tophoven said recent car bomb attacks in post-saddam hussein iraq confirmed how necessary a basic analysis of terrorism and its threat has become .
above all , he said , it is necessary to have a clear picture of the enemy the world is now dealing with . " i am absolutely certain that what the americans are currently experiencing in iraq is the result of a poor understanding of the ideology behind islamic terrorism , " he said .

"
a new research-based institute opens in essen dedicated to studying the threats of global terrorism . the institute for research on terrorism and security policy -lrb- iftus -rrb- has been set up to offer information on terrorism to a wider public as well as analyzing just how bad the global terrorist threat really is . the institute is to be headed up by one of germany 's top terrorism experts , rolf tophoven , and will provide associations , private customers and businesses with information and advice on understanding militant terrorism . no clear and present danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven tophoven -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had a stint at the end of the 1980s as the deputy head of bonn 's institute for terrorism research , told deutsche welle at the institute 's opening ceremony on thursday that germany was not in clear and present danger from the global terrorist threat , but the risk of attack was still there . " germany is not first in the firing line for international terrorists , " he said .
" the usa , great britain as well as other countries involved in the war on iraq are more at risk , as well as jewish and israeli interests .
but there are certainly jewish and israeli interests in germany , and it is here where there is a risk . " however , tophoven said , there is a high " abstract danger " to germans and added it was likely german tourists would be targeted again , as was the case with the recently released adventure tourists taken hostage by islamic militants in the sahara desert . tophoven said recent car bomb attacks in post-saddam hussein iraq confirmed how necessary a basic analysis of terrorism and its threat has become .
above all , he said , it is necessary to have a clear picture of the enemy the world is now dealing with . " i am absolutely certain that what the americans are currently experiencing in iraq is the result of a poor understanding of the ideology behind islamic terrorism , " he said .
" any regime can be taken out with tanks and aircraft warfare .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "

with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

"
a new research-based institute opens in essen dedicated to studying the threats of global terrorism . the institute for research on terrorism and security policy -lrb- iftus -rrb- has been set up to offer information on terrorism to a wider public as well as analyzing just how bad the global terrorist threat really is . the institute is to be headed up by one of germany 's top terrorism experts , rolf tophoven , and will provide associations , private customers and businesses with information and advice on understanding militant terrorism . no clear and present danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven tophoven -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had a stint at the end of the 1980s as the deputy head of bonn 's institute for terrorism research , told deutsche welle at the institute 's opening ceremony on thursday that germany was not in clear and present danger from the global terrorist threat , but the risk of attack was still there . " germany is not first in the firing line for international terrorists , " he said .
" the usa , great britain as well as other countries involved in the war on iraq are more at risk , as well as jewish and israeli interests .
but there are certainly jewish and israeli interests in germany , and it is here where there is a risk . " however , tophoven said , there is a high " abstract danger " to germans and added it was likely german tourists would be targeted again , as was the case with the recently released adventure tourists taken hostage by islamic militants in the sahara desert . tophoven said recent car bomb attacks in post-saddam hussein iraq confirmed how necessary a basic analysis of terrorism and its threat has become .
above all , he said , it is necessary to have a clear picture of the enemy the world is now dealing with . " i am absolutely certain that what the americans are currently experiencing in iraq is the result of a poor understanding of the ideology behind islamic terrorism , " he said .
" any regime can be taken out with tanks and aircraft warfare .
but what comes afterwards is another matter .
it 's necessary to recognize the structure of militant islam . " engaging with the terrorist threat as well as engaging in top-flight research in the coming months , iftus will also provide interested parties with seminars and day courses as well as a quarterly newsletter .
that will pick up on the main issues of security policy as well as focusing on current terrorism-related news . tophoven has a few questions he 'd like to pose the institute himself . " what sort of defense mechanisms can free democratic societies create to ensure that our citizens are protected , but also ensure that their rights are not limited ?
and what are the chances of being able to predict future terrorist attacks ? " he asks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany arrests terrorist helper 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell .

but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

german editorialists reflect on rau ’ s performance and offer up mixed reviews . the süddeutsche zeitung had only praise for rau in its friday edition .
" rau carried out his job as president smartly and pleasantly , " the editors wrote .
" rau always wanted to serve a second term .
but the times didn ’ t co- operate with him .
at his age , he has to think about the risk to his health .
and politically , he has to think about the risk that he might get voted down .
we wish that his respectable performance could have been recognized across party lines , with an extension into a second term . "
but the lausitzer rundschau newspaper in cottbus offered a more critical perspective .
" anybody who has observed johannes rau in the last few months has got to wonder if five more years would have been good for the 72-year-old man , " the paper wrote .
" but he himself didn ’ t recognize this fact , and gave the impression that he was nurturing further political hopes .
this throws a kind of shadow over an otherwise generally respectable presidency .
now that rau has announced he ’ s leaving , the gates are open for nominations . "
in other topics , the new proposal from the united states for a resolution on iraq has sparked heated commentary .
die welt , a newspaper from berlin , wrote that " even the toughest critics of american political decisions have to admit that george w. bush is going right up to the united nations and changing the previous plan .
iraq needs to be set on a course of self-administration , in accordance with at least part of the u.n. mandate . "
the offenbach post , also pointed to what it described as a turnaround in the u.s. approach .
" after their so-called victory , " said the paper , " the allies gave the un the cold shoulder .
but now the tide has turned .
now that gis are coming home in body bags and the costs of the iraq adventure are climbing into astronomical figures , washington is looking for the support of the world community .
it ’ s a declaration of bankruptcy .
the superpower has overextended itself .
this embarrassing confession is also a personal low point for george w. bush .
it puts him under unavoidable pressure in the current race for the white house . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met thursday and discussed the possibility of putting more european soldiers in iraq .
commenting on the meeting , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " france isn ’ t actually refusing to help militarily in the peacekeeping , stabilizing and rebuilding of iraq .
but france is putting big conditions on that help .
the german government , on the other hand , has completely refused to provide any military help .
berlin is sticking by its previous statements , but paris is giving itself room to maneuver and is open to negotiation .
there ’ s no difference in substance here ; but the differences in tactics show that the germans and the french don ’ t have the same interests in iraq . "
according to the editors of cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , " gerhard schroeder and jacques chirac are taking a clear political stand .
they are calling for an ‘ iraqisation ’ of the government in baghdad , to get rid of the impression that iraq is being occupied .
neither the french or the germans are pushing to participate .
but the real question is : how long can they hold out ? " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "
he added that a " forgotten country " was more appropriate than a " powerful one " like germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”
they were protesting eu trade and foreign policies .
though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .
their numbers are expected to swell to well over 20,000 on the second day of the informal gathering on saturday .
inside and outside the closed doors of this meeting , the number of divergent voices - offering opinions over the future of world politics and the european union - is growing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "

" germany is not first in the firing line for international terrorists , " he said .

above all , he said , it is necessary to have a clear picture of the enemy the world is now dealing with . " i am absolutely certain that what the americans are currently experiencing in iraq is the result of a poor understanding of the ideology behind islamic terrorism , " he said .
" any regime can be taken out with tanks and aircraft warfare .
but what comes afterwards is another matter .
it 's necessary to recognize the structure of militant islam . " engaging with the terrorist threat as well as engaging in top-flight research in the coming months , iftus will also provide interested parties with seminars and day courses as well as a quarterly newsletter .

german editorialists reflect on rau ’ s performance and offer up mixed reviews . the süddeutsche zeitung had only praise for rau in its friday edition .
" rau carried out his job as president smartly and pleasantly , " the editors wrote .
" rau always wanted to serve a second term .
but the times didn ’ t co- operate with him .
at his age , he has to think about the risk to his health .
and politically , he has to think about the risk that he might get voted down .
we wish that his respectable performance could have been recognized across party lines , with an extension into a second term . "
but the lausitzer rundschau newspaper in cottbus offered a more critical perspective .
" anybody who has observed johannes rau in the last few months has got to wonder if five more years would have been good for the 72-year-old man , " the paper wrote .
" but he himself didn ’ t recognize this fact , and gave the impression that he was nurturing further political hopes .
this throws a kind of shadow over an otherwise generally respectable presidency .
now that rau has announced he ’ s leaving , the gates are open for nominations . "
in other topics , the new proposal from the united states for a resolution on iraq has sparked heated commentary .
die welt , a newspaper from berlin , wrote that " even the toughest critics of american political decisions have to admit that george w. bush is going right up to the united nations and changing the previous plan .

it puts him under unavoidable pressure in the current race for the white house . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met thursday and discussed the possibility of putting more european soldiers in iraq .
commenting on the meeting , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " france isn ’ t actually refusing to help militarily in the peacekeeping , stabilizing and rebuilding of iraq .
but france is putting big conditions on that help .
the german government , on the other hand , has completely refused to provide any military help .
berlin is sticking by its previous statements , but paris is giving itself room to maneuver and is open to negotiation .
there ’ s no difference in substance here ; but the differences in tactics show that the germans and the french don ’ t have the same interests in iraq . "
according to the editors of cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , " gerhard schroeder and jacques chirac are taking a clear political stand .

german editorialists reflect on rau ’ s performance and offer up mixed reviews . the süddeutsche zeitung had only praise for rau in its friday edition .
" rau carried out his job as president smartly and pleasantly , " the editors wrote .
" rau always wanted to serve a second term .
but the times didn ’ t co- operate with him .
at his age , he has to think about the risk to his health .
and politically , he has to think about the risk that he might get voted down .
we wish that his respectable performance could have been recognized across party lines , with an extension into a second term . "
but the lausitzer rundschau newspaper in cottbus offered a more critical perspective .
" anybody who has observed johannes rau in the last few months has got to wonder if five more years would have been good for the 72-year-old man , " the paper wrote .
" but he himself didn ’ t recognize this fact , and gave the impression that he was nurturing further political hopes .
this throws a kind of shadow over an otherwise generally respectable presidency .
now that rau has announced he ’ s leaving , the gates are open for nominations . "
in other topics , the new proposal from the united states for a resolution on iraq has sparked heated commentary .
die welt , a newspaper from berlin , wrote that " even the toughest critics of american political decisions have to admit that george w. bush is going right up to the united nations and changing the previous plan .
iraq needs to be set on a course of self-administration , in accordance with at least part of the u.n. mandate . "
the offenbach post , also pointed to what it described as a turnaround in the u.s. approach .
" after their so-called victory , " said the paper , " the allies gave the un the cold shoulder .
but now the tide has turned .
now that gis are coming home in body bags and the costs of the iraq adventure are climbing into astronomical figures , washington is looking for the support of the world community .
it ’ s a declaration of bankruptcy .
the superpower has overextended itself .
this embarrassing confession is also a personal low point for george w. bush .
it puts him under unavoidable pressure in the current race for the white house . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met thursday and discussed the possibility of putting more european soldiers in iraq .
commenting on the meeting , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote : " france isn ’ t actually refusing to help militarily in the peacekeeping , stabilizing and rebuilding of iraq .
but france is putting big conditions on that help .
the german government , on the other hand , has completely refused to provide any military help .
berlin is sticking by its previous statements , but paris is giving itself room to maneuver and is open to negotiation .
there ’ s no difference in substance here ; but the differences in tactics show that the germans and the french don ’ t have the same interests in iraq . "
according to the editors of cologne ’ s stadt-anzeiger , " gerhard schroeder and jacques chirac are taking a clear political stand .
they are calling for an ‘ iraqisation ’ of the government in baghdad , to get rid of the impression that iraq is being occupied .
neither the french or the germans are pushing to participate .
but the real question is : how long can they hold out ? " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .
they object to the idea of a permanent eu president to replace the current rotating presidency and proposals to streamline the european commission , whereby each member state will no longer have a permanent representative .
they argue both changes would undermine the representation of smaller countries .
whether or not the ministers will confront these issues head-on or leave that to their representatives at the igc remains to be seen .
one eu official thought the negotiations would be carefully controlled : “ today it ’ s about procedure , italy will be determined not to let them discuss the substance at this stage . ”
anti-globalization protesters crash the party as the foreign ministers took up their agenda , anti-globalisation activists hoped to gain attention for their issues .
a group of 400 gathered outside the building and pushed back police lines , chanting , “ we have nothing to hide . ”

though the activists usually pass-up this kind of informal meeting , they were likely hoping to gain momentum running up to the world trade organization conference scheduled to begin in mexico next week .

" the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "
the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .
moving beyond the past and looking ahead this time round , the past played just a fringe role in schröder ’ s visit to prague . the chancellor seemed eager to bury the hatchet and move on .
" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .
czechs dissatisfied with eu draft constitution but apart from the niceties and eagerness to let bygones be bygones , the two leaders had their work cut out for them on the political front .
this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .
spidla raised objections to the draft text of the eu constitution , which foresees reducing the european commission from the current 20 representatives to 15 -lrb- whereby each country wo n't have a permanent representative -rrb- and proposes a longer-term eu president to replace the bloc ’ s six-month rotating presidency .
the czechs , along with other smaller candidate countries , fear that the constitution favors larger eu states like germany and france .
in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .
on friday , however , spidla toned down his rhetoric .
he stressed that he wanted to " negotiate successfully with an eye on the larger interest . "
schröder against fiddling with the draft constitution but the czech republic ’ s stance towards the draft constitution has alarmed germany , which wants to avoid fiddling with the document .
recently , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to smaller eu candidate countries not to torpedo the compromise text .
on friday , after talks with spidla , schröder spoke out against tampering with the draft constitution .
he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .
" czechs and germans are among those who have a common responsibility to ensure that the eu can be led politically and that it remains operational , " he said .
" center of expulsion " an unresolved issue another thorny issue that dominated the czech-german talks involved the location of a controversial " center of expulsion " for millions of europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century .
the german government has been reluctant to house such a center in berlin , and , on friday , the czechs came up with a host of alternate suggestions .
prime minister spidla said sweden could be a possible location for the center because of its neutrality .
" when one is doing something like this , it should be in a country that isn ’ t burdened by history – like sweden , " he said .
the czech president , vaclav havel , took a different view : " to be honest , i would prefer it if it -lrb- the center -rrb- was in sarajevo instead of berlin , or , better still , in pristina or kosovo . "

the statements sparked outrage and anger in germany and led to a souring of relations between the two neighbors .

" the past shouldn ’ t be allowed to dominate the future , " he told journalists .
" the czech republic and germany have every reason to look forward ; what has sometimes led to misunderstandings or differences of opinion should be relegated to the past . "
in fact - schröder pointed out - a 1997 czech-german declaration binds the two countries not to burden bilateral relations with controversies from the past .
the current czech prime minister , vladimir spidla , concurred with schröder 's forward looking remarks , stressing that relations between the two countries should be focussed on the future .
" the bilateral relationship is at its highest point in the long-running common history of the two countries , " he said .
schröder was honored on friday by several czech organizations for his role in supporting compensation payments for the 75,000 czech victims of forced labor under the nazis .
spidla said schröder ’ s initiative was an important contribution towards the development of good relations between the two countries .

this week , the czech republic , due to join the european union on may 1 , 2004 along with 14 other small and medium-sized countries , insisted on changes to the draft european union constitution .

in an interview with the german radio station deutschlandradio earlier this week , spidla said he expected " relatively tough " negotiations over the document , referring to an intergovernmental conference planned for october to prepare for the inking of the future constitution .
" if the big countries hold out , the conference will fail , " he said . spidla urged the larger members of the eu to compromise on the sticking points .

he said that he feared , " dismantling the packet would make it impossible to put it back together . "
in an interview published by the czech paper mlada fronta dnes on friday , schröder called on czechs to make every effort to ensure that the future constitution was adopted before the end of the year by all members of the enlarged eu .

chancellor schröder was in the czech republic on friday to mend strained relations with prague .
the nation 's looming eu entry and the delicate issue of a new european constitution topped talks with his czech counterpart . german chancellor gerhard schröder made a long-delayed visit to prague when he arrived in the czech capital for a one day visit on friday .
in march last year , schröder abruptly scrapped a visit to the city amid an ugly row over the so-called benes decrees .
under the decrees , 2.5 million germans were expelled by the czech authorities from the sudeten territories after world war ii .
they were stripped of property and citizenship ; most had supported the nazis when they annexed the borderlands in 1938 and the rest of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
at the time of the row last march , the country ’ s then prime minister , milos zeman , described the sudeten germans as " hitler ’ s fifth column " and defended their expulsion as a " mild punishment . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.09.2003 eu foreign ministers ponder iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu foreign ministers are meeting in this picturesque italian village , riva del garda , for informal talks .
with a number of topics on the agenda - an eu constitution and a " common strategic concept " - eu foreign ministers gathered in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
but debate over iraq threatens to dominate . ten eu foreign ministers met for a two-day informal meeting in riva del garda , italy , on friday .
scheduled a month before the start of an intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in rome , where eu representatives will debate the draft for a european constitution , the meeting in riva was meant to be a forum for ministers to iron out remaining constitution-related differences .
also on the agenda : how the eu can henceforth present a united front in foreign and security policy matters and timely topics including the middle east peace process .
events unfolding in iraq , particularly the latest u.s. draft of a u.n. resolution paving the way for more international involvement , may test eu members ' willingness to proceed together .
and debates over the future distribution of power within the eu that were outlined in the draft version of the constitution may also prove divisive .
ministers debate iraq resolution following the months leading up to the war in iraq - european nations were split , rendering efforts to create a common foreign and security policy -lrb- cfsp -rrb- ineffective - foreign ministers have been looking for ways to improve cooperation and speak with one voice -lrb- or at least a more harmonious sounding chorus -rrb- .
the eu ’ a high representative for common foreign and security policy , javier solana , presented a “ common strategic concept ” at the eu summit in saloniki , greece , in june , and he is scheduled to discuss it in further detail in riva .
it ’ s hoped that a “ common concept ” will help foster cooperation on matters relating to foreign and security policy and help avoid such public divisions in the future .
but as they look for ways to improve cooperation , it is unclear whether or not the ministers will be able to reach an agreement over the united state ’ s draft resolution on iraq .
“ there ’ s bound to be a bit of back-and-forth in the corridors on the iraq resolution , ” said one eu diplomat heading to the meeting .
france and germany , both opponents of the invasion , have thus far been reluctant to lend their support .
at a bilateral meeting in dresden , germany , on thursday , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder warned that the resolution did not promise to quickly cede power to the iraqis or the united nations .
meanwhile , britain is considering sending more troops .
iraq will also be a topic of conversation on saturday , when the ministers discuss the unravelling peace talks in the middle east and look for ways to get the process back on track .
big countries square off against small countries a month before the opening of the igc in rome on oct .
4 , the ministers will discuss the draft proposal for a european constitution .
the holders of the current eu presidency , italy , are hoping to wrap up the igc by the end of the year .
but they may face an uphill battle , as there are still some remaining divisions - primarily in how power should be distributed in the reformed eu .
france and germany , despite some misgivings , have both agreed to accept the constitution as it is , with german foreign minister joschka fischer warning that efforts to change any portion could result in the unravelling of carefully negotiated compromises .
smaller eu members , led by austria and finland , are not happy with the draft constitution .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

the senior british judge leading the investigation into the death of government weapons expert david kelly has warned against " ill-founded speculation " as to who may be criticised in his report . lord hutton , who has already heard evidence into the circumstances leading up to kelly 's death from prime minister tony blair , his defence secretary and top aides , said some witnesses will be recalled for cross examination when the inquiry resumes on sept .
15 . " the fact that i recall a witness to give further evidence in the second stage of the inquiry does not necessarily mean that i regard that person as a possible object of criticism , " hutton said . the four weeks of hearings so far have focused on whether the government deliberately exposed kelly as the source of a bbc report which accused the government of deliberately exaggerating claims about saddam hussein 's weapons program in a dossier making the case for war with iraq . the dossier claimed that saddam had the capability of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes . kelly denied being the source for the bbc story when he was questioned by a parliamentary committee , just days before he was found dead in a park near his home . evidence presented in the inquiry so far suggests that kelly did take his own life .
the pathologist who examined kelly 's body said he had probably died from blood loss after slashing his wrist , though he had also taken up to 30 prescription painkillers . a key question now is who was behind the government strategy of naming kelly as the source , as this is believed to have added to his mental strain in the week before his death . hoon in the hot seat much of the speculation is revolving around the role of defense secretary geoff hoon .
during his testimony , hoon said he was not involved in any discussions about going public with kelly 's identity . but on thursday , hoon 's special advisor , richard taylor , told the inquiry that hoon was present at a key meeting on july 9 , in which the policy of naming kelly was approved .
in light of taylor 's testimony , observers at the inquiry say it 's almost certain that hoon will be recalled for more questioning during the second stage . blair admitted during his testimony that his director of communications and strategy , alastair campbell , had wanted kelly named as the source of the bbc report .
campbell said that he followed the prime minister 's instructions to leave the matter to the ministry of defense . campbell announced his resignation last week , but insisted his decision had been made long ago and had nothing to do with kelly 's death or the contentious iraq dossier . campbell said he had no input into the dossier , but e-mails shown to the inquiry prove that he and other top aides pressed for it to be as hard-hitting as possible . kelly not alone in misgivings just where the now famous claim that saddam hussein could unleash weapons of mass destruction with only 45 minutes ' notice came from remains a mystery . but from the testimony of brian jones , who headed a team of chemical and biological weapons experts on the ministry of defense 's intelligence service , it has become clear that kelly was not the only government expert who was uncomfortable with the strength of the language used in the dossier . " i had some concerns about the 45 minute point myself , " jones told the inquiry .
" some of my staff had said that they were unhappy with all the detail that was in the dossier .
my expert analyst on chemical weapons expressed particular concern . " the hutton inquiry , through its use of testimony combined with internal e-mails and memos that were never meant to become the subject of such public scrutiny , is shining an unprecedented light on the inner workings of the blair 's government .
few reputations have emerged unblemished after the first stage of the inquiry .
at a news conference on thursday , blair declined to say whether he would resign if hutton criticizes his government . the bbc , too , is unlikely to escape criticism after an internal memo showed that editors believed the report accusing the government of sexing up the iraq dossier had been " marred by flawed reporting .

"
a new research-based institute opens in essen dedicated to studying the threats of global terrorism . the institute for research on terrorism and security policy -lrb- iftus -rrb- has been set up to offer information on terrorism to a wider public as well as analyzing just how bad the global terrorist threat really is . the institute is to be headed up by one of germany 's top terrorism experts , rolf tophoven , and will provide associations , private customers and businesses with information and advice on understanding militant terrorism . no clear and present danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven tophoven -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had a stint at the end of the 1980s as the deputy head of bonn 's institute for terrorism research , told deutsche welle at the institute 's opening ceremony on thursday that germany was not in clear and present danger from the global terrorist threat , but the risk of attack was still there . " germany is not first in the firing line for international terrorists , " he said .
" the usa , great britain as well as other countries involved in the war on iraq are more at risk , as well as jewish and israeli interests .
but there are certainly jewish and israeli interests in germany , and it is here where there is a risk . " however , tophoven said , there is a high " abstract danger " to germans and added it was likely german tourists would be targeted again , as was the case with the recently released adventure tourists taken hostage by islamic militants in the sahara desert . tophoven said recent car bomb attacks in post-saddam hussein iraq confirmed how necessary a basic analysis of terrorism and its threat has become .
above all , he said , it is necessary to have a clear picture of the enemy the world is now dealing with . " i am absolutely certain that what the americans are currently experiencing in iraq is the result of a poor understanding of the ideology behind islamic terrorism , " he said .
" any regime can be taken out with tanks and aircraft warfare .
but what comes afterwards is another matter .
it 's necessary to recognize the structure of militant islam . " engaging with the terrorist threat as well as engaging in top-flight research in the coming months , iftus will also provide interested parties with seminars and day courses as well as a quarterly newsletter .
that will pick up on the main issues of security policy as well as focusing on current terrorism-related news . tophoven has a few questions he 'd like to pose the institute himself . " what sort of defense mechanisms can free democratic societies create to ensure that our citizens are protected , but also ensure that their rights are not limited ?
and what are the chances of being able to predict future terrorist attacks ? " he asks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany arrests terrorist helper 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell .

"
a new research-based institute opens in essen dedicated to studying the threats of global terrorism . the institute for research on terrorism and security policy -lrb- iftus -rrb- has been set up to offer information on terrorism to a wider public as well as analyzing just how bad the global terrorist threat really is . the institute is to be headed up by one of germany 's top terrorism experts , rolf tophoven , and will provide associations , private customers and businesses with information and advice on understanding militant terrorism . no clear and present danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven tophoven -lrb- photo -rrb- , who had a stint at the end of the 1980s as the deputy head of bonn 's institute for terrorism research , told deutsche welle at the institute 's opening ceremony on thursday that germany was not in clear and present danger from the global terrorist threat , but the risk of attack was still there . " germany is not first in the firing line for international terrorists , " he said .
" the usa , great britain as well as other countries involved in the war on iraq are more at risk , as well as jewish and israeli interests .
but there are certainly jewish and israeli interests in germany , and it is here where there is a risk . " however , tophoven said , there is a high " abstract danger " to germans and added it was likely german tourists would be targeted again , as was the case with the recently released adventure tourists taken hostage by islamic militants in the sahara desert . tophoven said recent car bomb attacks in post-saddam hussein iraq confirmed how necessary a basic analysis of terrorism and its threat has become .
above all , he said , it is necessary to have a clear picture of the enemy the world is now dealing with . " i am absolutely certain that what the americans are currently experiencing in iraq is the result of a poor understanding of the ideology behind islamic terrorism , " he said .
" any regime can be taken out with tanks and aircraft warfare .
but what comes afterwards is another matter .
it 's necessary to recognize the structure of militant islam . " engaging with the terrorist threat as well as engaging in top-flight research in the coming months , iftus will also provide interested parties with seminars and day courses as well as a quarterly newsletter .
that will pick up on the main issues of security policy as well as focusing on current terrorism-related news . tophoven has a few questions he 'd like to pose the institute himself . " what sort of defense mechanisms can free democratic societies create to ensure that our citizens are protected , but also ensure that their rights are not limited ?
and what are the chances of being able to predict future terrorist attacks ? " he asks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany arrests terrorist helper 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell .

the women lived in sheltered homes for the elderly in the london borough of harrow and worked a basic 37 hour week .
but they were kept on call for another 76 hours .
an employment tribunal said the council had breached working time regulations and awarded the women £ 1,500 compensation each .
during their standby time they could not leave the sheltered housing , and the women said this led to social isolation .
this recognises the right of every working person to enjoy some sort of social life away from work solicitor anita vadgama the tribunal said the council had not given the women proper daily rest or given them the national minimum wage for their time on standby .
it decided the 76 hours the workers were on call counted as work .
the women are also likely to get back pay worth thousands in addition to the £ 1,500 compensation .
tony warr , the gmb union official who backed the women 's case , said : " this is a major breakthrough for low paid and over-worked employees .
" the conditions imposed on these dedicated workers made a nonsense of the requirement that they should enjoy a minimum of 11 hours of uninterrupted rest from work every day . "
' trapped for 24 hours ' solicitors thompsons , engaged by the union to fight the case , said it was a " landmark " decision .
" this recognises the right of every working person to enjoy some sort of social life away from work .
" these women were trapped for 24 hours a day , five days a week and could not leave their homes because they were on call , " said solicitor anita vadgama .
the workers had been able to regain control over their family and social lives , thompsons said .
harrow council did not comment but said it was considering an appeal .

the latest meeting of the 21-country asia pacific economic co-operation -lrb- apec -rrb- group , was expected to be dominated by the value of china 's currency , the yuan , which has been pegged at 8.30 to the dollar for a decade .
chinese ministers , however , stayed well away from the limelight , offering only to loosen controls on companies ' rights to own foreign currencies .
too fast a move away from the peg , they hinted , would spell disaster for an economy already breeding uncomfortably high unemployment .
reluctance and the other apec ministers were little keener on any rapid move to the kind of pure market-based currency system the us wants .
we expect our trading partners to treat our people fairly ... and we do n't think we 're being treated fairly when a currency is controlled by the government president george w bush in a statement , the 21 said the priority was regional structural reform , refusing to commit to the " flexible " exchange rate policies sought by the us .
" we emphasized the importance of accelerating structural reform , adopting macroeconomic policies that promote sustainable growth , supported by appropriate exchange rate policies that facilitate orderly and balanced external adjustment , " the ministers said in a statement .
" while recognizing that there is no single exchange rate regime that suits all economies at all time , we noted a view expressed at the meeting that more flexible exchange rate management , in some cases , would promote this objective . "
' deal with it ' those considerations did not play well in washington , where president george w bush responded to building pressure about the dismal job situation at home with an outspoken attack on china 's currency policy .
in an interview on the business tv channel cnbc , president bush said his treasury secretary , john snow , would be delivering a " strong message " .
" we expect our trading partners to treat our people fairly - our producers and workers and farmers and manufacturers - and we do n't think we 're being treated fairly when a currency is controlled by the government , " he said .
" we believe the currency ought to be controlled by the market . "
after mr snow returned from meetings in beijing to discuss china 's yuan policy , the two of them would " deal with it accordingly " , president bush said .
unions and some lawmakers accuse china 's weak yuan policy of stealing american jobs by pricing us companies out of the international market , and the issue could play heavily during the run-up to the presidential elections in november next year .
but it is not only china in the firing line , as some diplomats believe japan 's return to selling the yen - trying to reduce its value to support its own exporters - could also incur us ire .

the anti-racist charity positive action in housing has branded the dungavel immigration and removal centre in lanarkshire " an ugly scar " on scotland 's conscience and condemned labour msps for their " wall of silence " .
it wants to see the centre shut down immediately and is appealing to politicians to speak out on behalf of the children held there .
the call was backed by housing associations and opposition msps .
positive action director robina qureshi said : " ordinary scots are becoming increasingly outraged when they hear that children are being imprisoned without time limit , trail or having committed a crime on scottish soil and our political leaders have nothing to say about it .
" the scottish executive appears to not want to say anything publicly on this growing embarrassment for fear of upsetting westminster . "
" there are some absolutes in any civilised society , one of these is that we do not imprison children especially children who 've done nothing wrong . "
david orr she added : " refugees came here to seek sanctuary but now it looks like they should be seeking asylum from britain because we take away their liberty for claiming asylum in this country .
" we lock them up without crime , time limit or trial .
that 's as bad as the countries they fled . "
aamer anwar , a human rights lawyer who represented the ay family detained at dungavel before being deported , described dungavel as " barbaric " .
he said : " the dungavel regime refuses mothers the right to feed children as and when they want and refuses the children the right to play in freedom .
" the logic that this government is following is one of fascism and can no longer claim to be a civilised society when political points are being scored by incarcerating children .
" dungavel should be immediately shut down. the home office has repeatedly breached international law , the un convention on the rights of the child , and these crimes are being carried out on scottish soil .
right to education david orr , chief executive of scottish federation of housing associations , backed the call for dungavel 's closure .
he said : " there are some absolutes in any civilised society , one of these is that we do not imprison children especially children who 've done nothing wrong .
" given the opportunity and the policy framework we are capable of finding better ways of housing asylum seekers .
" the continuing incarceration of our children is a disgrace for all parts of our government . "

all three - a bronze age copper mine and historic hall , both in north wales , and a former townhouse in the south - are competing in the welsh leg of the bbc series restoration .
they are among 30 dilapidated buildings and heritage sites from around the uk which are being featured in the interactive 10-programme series .
viewers are asked to vote for one site to win enough money from a special fund to save it from dereliction .
parys mountain - including nearby amlwch port - in anglesey and faenol old hall near bangor , a few miles away , are two of the welsh contenders vying for the multi-million pound prize .
llanelly house in llanelli - said to be one of the finest examples of an 18th century townhouse in the country - is the third venue exposed to the vote .
already an inner city swimming baths in manchester , a non-conformist chapel and a scottish castle are among those regional winners which have reached the restoration final .
a survey for the series , presented by cardiff-born griff rhys jones , found that 72 % of people in wales said they felt depressed by empty derelict historic buildings in their area .
each venue has an " advocate " to sing its praises .
changing rooms interior designer laurence llewelyn-bowen is supporting llanelly house - for the building itself , the impact of a restoration programme and for its architecture .
pink fur he also warns that if the programme 's viewers do not save it he will buy it .
" i will paint it purple , i will cover the roof in pink fur fabric , and i will sell it to kylie for £ 65 billion , " says llewellyn-bowen .
anglesey-born euro mp glenys kinnock meanwhile is the celebrity advocate who is " passionate " about parys mountain 's bid .
copper mining took place at parys mountain from as far back as the bronze age until 1915 .
" where else in britain , where else in the world indeed , could you go and actually see the bronze age workings , see where the foundations of the british industrial revolution were laid ? " she said .
actor robert hardy , meanwhile is championing the faenol old hall .
thought to date back to the 1550s , the hall was home to local aristocratic families until 1980 when it was sold at auction and later fell into disrepair .
now the estate is the venue for an annual summer weekend concert organised by opera star bryn terfel .
" faenol is remarkable for its ability to take you into the past , " said hardy .
the winner from the welsh heat will progress to a uk final at the tower of london later this month .
then the public will decide on the project most worthy of the multi-million pound restoration .
restoration is screened on bbc 2 on friday 5 september at 2100 bst .

all three - a bronze age copper mine and historic hall , both in north wales , and a former townhouse in the south - are competing in the welsh leg of the bbc series restoration .
they are among 30 dilapidated buildings and heritage sites from around the uk which are being featured in the interactive 10-programme series .
viewers are asked to vote for one site to win enough money from a special fund to save it from dereliction .
parys mountain - including nearby amlwch port - in anglesey and faenol old hall near bangor , a few miles away , are two of the welsh contenders vying for the multi-million pound prize .
faenol old hall near bangor dates back to the 1550s llanelly house in llanelli - said to be one of the finest examples of an 18th century townhouse in the country - is the third venue exposed to the vote .
already an inner city swimming baths in manchester , a non-conformist chapel and a scottish castle are among those regional winners which have reached the restoration final .
a survey for the series , presented by cardiff-born griff rhys jones , found that 72 % of people in wales said they felt depressed by empty derelict historic buildings in their area .

cathy peattie , who chairs the scottish parliament 's equal opportunities committee , described as " crazy " the policy of locking up asylum seekers and called for the closure of dungavel as soon as possible .
ms peattie urged the first minister , jack mcconnell , to intervene and said many of her labour colleagues shared the same view .
mr mcconnell has distanced himself from the controversy , consistently saying that immigration and asylum are the responsibility of the home office and do not fall within the remit of the devolved scottish parliament .
ms peattie , msp for falkirk east , told the bbc 's good morning scotland programme : " it is a reserved issue , it is for the uk ministers to be dealing with this and i do n't think we can expect jack mcconnell to stand up in the scottish parliament and make a speech on this issue . "
i think the scottish community are appalled at the stories they are hearing , mothers having to sneak food into rooms to feed children " cathy peattie " but i would urge our scottish ministers to be speaking to uk ministers to find a solution and to move this forward quickly .
i think it 's an appalling system and we can do better than this .
" i know that scottish ministers over the summer have been speaking to uk ministers .
i know they have been speaking around education etc .
" i think the scottish community are appalled at the stories they are hearing , mothers having to sneak food into rooms to feed children .
" i 'm sure my labour colleagues are equally concerned .
i 'm sure people are equally concerned and are aware it 's a reserved issue but i 'm sure they feel exactly the same as i do that this situation is unacceptable . "
asked if she felt her comments would jeopardise her career , she said : " " who knows ?
i do n't think so . "
another labour msp , elaine smith , described dungavel as an " aberration " .
' unsustainable ' position bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said that mr mcconnell 's current line in which he was insisting that he could not even share his personal view was unsustainable .
if he did speak out , he would feel under pressure to support the westminister line which would provoke problems among labour msps and cause a rift with his party 's coalition partners in scotland , the liberal democrats .
pressure for action is being increased by campaigners who want the former prison to be shut with newspapers falling in behind those pressing for closure .
an editorial in friday 's herald is headlined " dungavel , scotland 's shame ...
first minister should voice his opinion on centre . "
in a letter to the newspaper from the roman catholic bishop of paisley , john mone , wrote : " our first minister must have a view on this subject .
i call on him in a spirit of openness to make it known . "
a spokesman for mr mcconnell insisted that immigration policy was reserved to the uk government and scottish ministers were unable to discuss issues publicly .
at a public meeting in glasgow on friday night , campaigners will repeat their insistence that the centre should be closed and children held there integrated into mainstream education .
a protest is being organised to take place outside the centre at midday on saturday .
' ugly scar ' the anti-racist charity positive action in housing has branded the dungavel immigration and removal centre in lanarkshire " an ugly scar " on scotland 's conscience and condemned labour msps for their " wall of silence " .
in a further twist , the secretary of the scottish trades union congress -lrb- stuc -rrb- , bill speirs , described dungavel as being like guantanamo bay , the camp in cuba where the us is holding terror suspects .
his claim was rejected by home office minister beverley hughes , who said it was a " slur " on staff who worked diligently at dungavel .

a third of children under four have a television in their bedrooms , research by the early learning centre has found .
chief inspector of schools david bell says young children 's communication and behaviour are worse than ever because parents put the television on rather than talk and play with children .
critics say allowing children uncontrolled access to tv will slow their development but an educational psychology professor paul van den broek says children who can follow tv storylines may become better readers .
is tv so bad ?
are parents under more pressure to stimulate their children ?
do you think performance at school is directly affected by tv ?
what did you do with your free time as a child ?
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : hey adults do it ... and it appears not to affect them much .
in fact apart from some of our pathetic soaps it 's a pretty good education tool when science facts and history are shown .
richard sweetman , england the problem with children watching too much tv is that communication is only one way .
they get " input " but do n't communicate outwards .
when i was a child , we used to spend a lot of time playing games , ludo , snakes and ladders and also making things -lrb- using shoe boxes to make our own theatres with cut-outs from comics .
who remembers doing that ? ! -rrb- .
have a look at the population aged 50-60 -lrb- who did n't have tv as children -rrb- and then those who are aged under 40 .
speaks for itself really , does n't it ?
dave owens , uk i remember in the 70s hearing about kids addicted to tv john , uk this is old news .
i remember as a teenager in the 70s hearing about kids addicted to tv .
at least there was less children 's tv then , and we were forced to watch the dramas , documentaries and comedies for grown-ups instead , from which i learned a lot about the world .
john , uk i lived without a tv for years on my own , it was only my wife that really missed it .
she wanted cartoons to entertain the kids , well it entertains them and i just do n't go in the lounge any more .
mike , uk for all those worried about leaving their children in front of the tv - worry not , for the radio times is at hand !
yes , every week they take a children 's tv programme , get two kids and two parents to watch it , and then discuss if it 's suitable for your child to watch tv on its own or not .
this week , one mother said something along the lines of " i would watch it with my daughter -lrb- 4 -rrb- if she asked me to but it 's not necessary . "
thanks to the radio times you need never watch tv with your children ever again !
mark , scotland you would n't dream of sending your kids to the library , roaming free in the adult section , so why do the same with tv ?
juliette , uk my son , aged 26 months , knows tony blair is prime minister chris mcgeachin , poland -lrb- ex uk -rrb- calm down .
my son , aged 26 months , knows tony blair is the prime minister of britain and that george bush is ' prime minister ' of america , he recognises both of them .
he knows the capitals of france , uk , poland and germany .
he always says please and thank you , can differentiate between football , rugby and cricket , knows that baseball is a girl 's game called rounders and that the nearby park is a great place to kick a ball .
quality tv -lrb- believe me , it exists -rrb- , when matched with other physical and mental stimulus is n't just good for you , it 's fantastic .
chris mcgeachin , poland -lrb- ex uk -rrb- i dislike it that my 12-year-old has for years found her main entertainment on the small screen .
however she is mildly dyslexic and finds reading on her own very difficult .
she watches too many soap episodes for my liking , but she has also watched romeo and juliet , pride and prejudice , middlemarch , the mill on the floss , countless science and art programmes , sport and david attenborough .
she is a fierce jane austen fan because of these bbc costume dramas for which i am immensely grateful .
when she slumps down in front of hollyoaks or eastenders after a long day at school , i have to ask myself what i would choose to watch if i were exhausted and wanted to chill out for a couple of hours before bed .
there are moments of sheer pleasure on tv for me as an adult , and i see no reason why my children should n't use tv in the same way .
mick , uk i would never have coped with school if i were in front of the tv kate , uk what is all this nonsense about dyslexics need tv more than other children ?
i am dyslexic and dyspraxic and i would never have coped with school if i were stuck in front of the tv all the time .
i improved my chances of doing well by taking part in sports and passtimes which enabled me to improve my co-ordination and were well away form the tv .
kate , uk i work with old people living alone .
those trying to alleviate their loneliness using television , often rapidly develop a mental deterioration associated with alzheimer 's .
those involved in some activity , it does n't seem to matter what so long as other people are involved , invariably stay mentally alert much longer .
andrew , uk i think too much tv is bad .
what happened to the art of conversation and providing your own entertainment ?
too many people use the tv instead of making their own enjoyment .
reading and playing games is far more stimulating for a child 's growth both physically and mentally .
catherine ruffy , england ' just switch off your television set and go out and do something less boring instead ! '
everyone over the age of 25 will know what i 'm talking about !
wendy , uk the tv is an entertainment device and nothing more pg , australia / uk tv has a lot of educational benefits - there is a plethora of educational material to be had , but , the tv should be regarded as one aspect of entertaining .
a half hour children 's show in the morning is ample for my two-year-old .
but he has learned so much more from physical interaction with other children when at school , as well as my own time with him bonding and reading .
the tv is an entertainment device and nothing more .
if you do n't feel safe having your child playing in the park by themselves , go with them and encourage them to exercise by being an active role model .
pg , australia / uk i am puzzled at all these people who watch tv so much - what on earth do they find to watch ?
we have found nothing to watch since last friday except the news so it has stayed off .
have people no discernment any more ?
catherine davies , england as a full time working mum to an active two-year-old i am exhausted after a hard day at work but can honestly say that there is nothing more rewarding and relaxing than spending the remainder of the day playing and educating my daughter .
i think the key is to engage yourself and your children in a variety of activities and show them that you enjoy their company .
susan , uk i know too many parents who want their children to watch tv so that they do n't disturb them .
one lazy generation of parents are making their children even lazier by letting them watch hours of mind numbing tv which does not stimulate them to be productive .
i think too many tv programs are cheap , un-stimulating or at there worse full of violence .
this goes for adult programmes as well .
too many channels and not enough intellect .
frances , uk we are all too busy watching rubbish on tv to bother actually living james mcnamara , london what do people expect ?
children watch too much tv because the grown ups do too .
the problem is that people ca n't be bothered to do anything else .
some people do n't even cook anymore .
we are all too busy watching rubbish on tv to bother actually living .
james mcnamara , london i know everyone complains about how tv is affecting children 's outdoor lives , but times have changed .
when you were young , you probably played in the park all the time , but back then , your grandparents were probably grumbling about how it was n't proper .
how you should be working .
as the times change , tv is an increasingly important part of our lives .
in the modern day of metropolis ' playing outdoors is definitely unattractive and , at that age , like it or not , the parks are probably dominated by teenagers playing football .
the decrease in interest to sports can not be attributed solely to tv .
quincy , hong kong it is not suitable for children to have tv in their own bedroom .
parents have the responsibilities to watch over their kids and guide the kids if they have any questions .
it is easy for them to absorb everything shown on tv , what they see and what they listen .
as we know , nowadays many inappropriate words or scenes shown on tv which is not suitable for kids .
are we going to let them be uncontrolled children ?
hillwan , uk in my opinion , so long as children are receiving stimulation from other sources - books etc - watching a lot of tv does n't have to be a bad thing , it can teach a lot of things and children can absorb it quicker because it 's via a medium that they enjoy .
sarah , uk it is more crucial to talk about what they watch .
there is a lot of informative , entertaining quality programmes on tv , if you look for them .
unfortunately there is also a lot of cheap dross , and more damaging a lot of rubbish that perpetuates the myth of " laddish " culture being cool .
the only people who can have any influence on this are the programme commissioners - they alone bear the responsibility of the plethora of trash tv on our screens .
graeme , england using tv while parents do something else is wrong vik , middx , uk children probably do watch too much tv in the wrong situations and under the wrong circumstances .
my two year old likes the tv , but we sit and watch together , talking about what we see and what people are doing .
and if we 're not watching something specific , the tv is off .
it 's quality of viewing as well that 's the problem , not just quantity .
he likes to watch nature programmes , and therefore has a wonderful recognition of animals .
using tv as a distraction while parents -lrb- or babysitters -rrb- do something else is wrong .
developing a child 's mind and imagination is critically important , and while some tv can contribute to this , nobody should be fooled into thinking it can replace social interaction .
vik , middx , uk i have two children under the age of three and the only thing they watch is cbeebies - and they do n't even like that very much .
they would much rather play with their cars and trucks .
children need to be encouraged to interact with each other and toys , not with the tv .
playing with toys helps then to develop there imagination .
some children 's tv programmes are good because i can see that my son gets excited with the sounds , colours and actions of the characters .
we sit there and watch it together so that he can explain to me what 's happening and i feel he has a better understanding about what he is watching .
suzanne o 'keeffe , england sure , there are probably better things for your child to be doing , like playing outside with friends .
whether that is any safer than a life in front of the tv , who knows .
the " educational value " of some of these children 's tv programmes is decidedly questionable though .
in later life , tv becomes more important because it is often the focus of conversation at social gatherings .
tv also satisfies a lot of our emotional needs .
it 's full of sex , violence , drama , turmoil and information about the world that many can not and will not afford to see in their lifetime .
gavin , wales i was at a church picnic a few weeks ago , we were playing rounders and football , then i noticed that there were loads of adults , but only around half the kids were running about and playing , the other half -lrb- notably the " chubby " half -rrb- were sat under trees playing on games etc .
what a sad state of affairs , when that is the most natural thing for them to do on cannock chase on a sunny hot day !
tv has created these habits that these people will suffer with for the rest of their lives !
paul sealey , england the telly is a great addition to real life but a terrible substitute for it charles moore , scotland it 's not so much a case of too much tv as too little of other things .
if you get your kids out walking in the countryside , playing sport , bird watching , cooking , playing an instrument etc , it does n't matter how much tv they watch on top -lrb- if they 've got time ! -rrb- .
the bottom line is that the telly is a great addition to real life but a terrible substitute for it .
charles moore , scotland television is the substitute babysitter of today .
it is a quick easy alternative to creating other activities .
tell most children to go without tv for a week and look at the face of horror they create .
david adama , usa i think tv can be a great teacher for kids - if they watch the right things .
but your picture of the tellytubbies is apt - do we want the next generation to prance around talking gibberish all the time ?
it 's insulting to their young intelligence .
tim , uk to watch tv in solitude is even worse harriet , uk the fact that 60 % of children under six have a tv in their bedroom is awful .
to watch tv in solitude is even worse .
it reduces their basic interaction skills from a very early age .
it then becomes apparent that parents are complaining that their children do n't communicate enough with them .
i 'm 15 , and when i was younger my parents set rules about the amount of tv my brother and i watched .
we were also not allowed to watch game shows and soaps .
this meant that the quality and quantity of the tv we saw was increased , and decreased , respectively .
harriet , uk i watch tv , but i do n't watch mindless programmes , as the people who try to make a name for themselves by digging up age-old social issues would have you believe .
i watch quality tv like the west wing , which is both entertaining and educational .
jefferson regan , 15 , uk tv is fine , it is just the amount children watch that 's the problem .
putting a tv in a child 's room is absolute madness : children should be outdoors , running around , interacting with other children and learning things first hand , not being spoon fed stuff from a screen .
wendy , uk every adult in this country is to blame for any behavioural problems in children resulting from that box that sits in the corner .
from adults not supervising children and what they watch and the length of time they watch , to those who work in the media , be it programming or advertising .
to the teachers who still use the tv as a teaching tool or for that end of term ' treat ' .
to those that complain about behaviour of our young adults but do n't see the connection between bad language and violence and the constant bombardment of advertising on tv before 10pm .
we are all to blame , every time we turn on our tvs whether there is a child in the room or not .
society in this country has a lot to answer for and i do believe its getting worse .
elaine , uk i agree with david bell that poor parenting is to blame .
parents have lost control of their children .
tv is educational and it is the parents ' responsibility to guide .
let 's start with the basics : when my parents said no more tv they meant no more .
ojay , uk in all the commenting on how much brits watch tv , no one is actually telling the populace that they have the option to turn the tv off .
my husband and i have chosen not to have a tv - the radio serves for news and we can watch dvds when we want on the computer .
because of this we can choose the images which imprint themselves indelibly on our memories , and hold out against the bombasting of adverts .
we have much more time for reading , going for walks , playing games - and talking to each other !
when friends come to visit -lrb- adults and children alike -rrb- , we engage with each other rather than sit and absorb whatever the television has to fill us with .
k johnson , scotland young children are wasting valuable time emma jacobs , england i completely agree , young children are filling their minds with useless information and wasting valuable time .
instead they could go out on an enjoyable trip out to the park or maybe visit children of similar ages , therefore they can interact and communicate , which could help them to deal with relationships as they grow .
hopefully in the future these tv addicts will not spend all there time on the couch , not moving an inch , not knowing what day it is and frankly not living a normal or healthy life .
in my opinion it is down to the parents .
another thing this country is failing in ... parenting .
emma jacobs , england no tv cuts us off from a billion people .
too much tv prevents us off from participating in the world instead of viewing it .
how about trying moderation instead of knee-jerk responses to every single scientific and psychological study that comes down the pike ?
emma , uk i think people in general , not just children , watch too much tv .
it often seems as though those of us who are not into soaps , game shows , reality tv and what passes for " sit-coms " these days are considered odd-balls .
and when the tv -lrb- and radio -rrb- is n't filled with this trivia , it seems to be filled with endless chat about the trivia .
children only follow the example of others , after all .
david hazel , uk nowadays it is pretty difficult to take control of what our children are watching while we are out .
i think that some activities like football , swimming could be a good solution to keep them off tv .
cintia ribeiro , brazil society now is driven by superficial needs , greed , money and sex , and tv is a big part of it .
i think it 's disgusting that children as young as three have their own tv set in their room .
young children do n't need tv - i was n't allowed to watch it until i was 5 and i was taught how to read , write and i learnt very quickly .
of course children should be allowed to watch children 's programmes and educational ones , but should always be supervised .
soaps like eastenders are totally unsuitable for young children to watch .
victoria parker , england you tell a child to do something else other than watch tv so they log on to the pc and join internet chat rooms .
then you tell them to find something else to do so they start texting friends on their mobiles !
is fresh air and exercise now forbidden to the under 16 's ?
andy , uk the tv should play only a secondary role in children 's ' lives graeme phillips , germany , normally uk the tv should play only a secondary role in children 's ' lives .
i remember reading to kill a mockingbird by harper lee , where jean-louise -lrb- scout -rrb- finch learned to read , when calpurnia gave her passages out the bible to copy , so that she could be kept off her hands .
if this sort of thing does actually happen in real life , perhaps we could try it on children when we are busy .
at least an approach like that would make things easier for them at school .
graeme phillips , germany , normally uk every morning my four year old wakes up at about 6am , goes downstairs on her own and opens the back door for the dog to be let out .
she then turns on the tv , presses 617 on the remote and watches two hours of cbeebies before anyone else wakes up !
it 's marvellous .
she gets her own tv time , the wife and i get a lie in and when the other two kids get up they argue about the tv because they each want a different channel on .
tv is a part of our life .
it 's full of educational programmes and i think my four year old has it sussed down to a tee .
paul cook , uk my child who is now three has watched tv since birth and is the brightest child in his nursery .
charlene , london i think it depends on the programmes the kids watch , some parents do n't have the knowledge about things kids can watch on educational tv programmes , maybe more vetting of the programmes and encouraging play or reading at other times ?
lena wright , uk i think tv is a bad influence on children , especially now there is so much poor language on television .
children need good examples to which to aspire , not the inane semi-literate drivel one can hear on shows such as eastenders and many others .
tv was rationed when i was a child and it was only ever switched on when one of us was going to watch a particular programme .
if visitors arrived it was switched off immediately .
kulu , uk it 's a case of tv being used as a free babysitter gareth dean , ex-pat it 's not a case of too much tv .
it 's a case of tv being used as a free babysitter .
today 's society is more hectic for adults which consequently leaves less time for proper human interaction with kids .
it 's about cause and effect .
adults have less time and energy to dedicate to raising children because of the necessity of both parents working / longer hours / high cost of living yet the government finds a way of shifting the blame for the effects of unacceptable extra loads they have put on parents back to them !
gareth dean , ex-pat julie says that " good social , behavioural and communication skills are far more important " than reading .
that 's true , but tv does n't improve those things either .
in our household we watch no tv whatsoever .
not only do we save the $ 40 / month cable tv bill , but that leaves us time for art , music , meals together , and family projects .
peter nelson , usa it 's terrible !
it means they 're not playing enough computer games .
games designer , uk this summer we limited our two primary-age children to two hours tv / dvds / videos a day , which they timed themselves using a stopwatch .
the benefits : they became selective in their viewing , used listings magazines to decide what to watch -lrb- developing research and negotiating skills -rrb- , worked out what they could fit into the time available -lrb- maths and planning skills -rrb- , my younger daughter learned to tell the time and they both spent a lot of time doing other things !
interestingly , when they planned their viewing carefully themselves rather than simply channel hopping they very rarely used up their full two hours .
suzanne b , uk if you ca n't afford anything else you put the tv on lorraine , uk why on earth do we think children need constant stimulation ?
if you ca n't afford anything else you put the tv on .
those who have money are taxiing them to tennis lessons , chess clubs and drama groups or buying them a pc .
children today are entertainment junkies .
boredom encourages creativity .
do n't believe me ?
give a three year-old a few cardboard boxes and see how long it is before it 's a train , a car , a shop , a hat , a cooker .
lorraine , uk when i was a child there was only about two hours worth of children 's tv on during the day .
so we had to find something else to do - usually reading or playing pretend games .
tv is still passive no matter how educational it is .
jane , wales , uk everybody watches too much tv .
how about talking , or reading ?
interact !
do n't rely on the tv for everything !
pete , uk gone are the days of low quality pulp tv .
today 's tv is full of educational and stimulating media .
my four-year-old son is already learning spanish because one of his favourite shows has a spanish speaking character and the shows website has a game which allows him to practice his spanish .
i think parents should not allow children unrestricted access to tv but tv is not the demon it used to be and it should not be made a scapegoat or excuse for drugging our children into mindless conforming zombies .
paul clarke , uk many parents just do n't know how to play effectively with their kids steve f , notts , uk so much of what is on offer is imported , cartoon-based , and aimed at selling products to kids .
i grew up with johnny ball and swap shop , which were more about informing kids .
rightly or wrongly , the perception is that it just is n't safe allowing children the freedom to play outside on their own as was the case when i was growing up .
i suspect many parents just do n't know how to play effectively with their kids .
not all of us are blessed with the creativity necessary to invent games and constantly keep them amused !
steve f , notts , uk i watched a huge amount of tv when i was a child .
i also read a lot of books though and did n't have a tv in my bedroom till i was quite a lot older .
nowadays i 'm happy , well-educated and gainfully employed .
i do n't watch much tv anymore , but i do n't regret the time i did because i learned a lot .
i wish i could be confident though that children watching tv now were watching educational entertainment , rather than reality tv dross .
katherine , uk this seems to be a pretty useless discussion to me .
the fact is , all people writing in are evidently internet and pc literate , and hence are likely to be reasonably intelligent and well educated .
as such , the parents writing in are not the people who david bell was commenting on .
tragically , the kids who are not brought up well and will be disruptive at school , will tend to be from families who are badly educated themselves , with little social understanding , and likely not able to find , let alone contribute to a forum such as this .
paul johnson , uk parents need support in the form of nursery school provision and parenting clubs charles moore , scotland can we get back to the real world please ?
it 's all very well moaning about parents not matching up to the standards of the " goody two shoes " tendency in society .
the point is that we have an urgent and real problem and we need to find solutions , not scapegoats .
it is clear that a large number of parents need support in the form of enhanced nursery school provision , parenting classes and parenting clubs .
unless we grasp the nettle and pay for these things now we are going to paying a lot more in years to come .
charles moore , scotland people should remember that there are quite a few children starting school with dyslexia and dyspraxia , amongst other disorders , and they will be quite likely be clumsy and not as adept as other children .
this does not mean they are lacking in intelligence , but it may make them appear to be " behind " in some skills .
it is very frustrating for the child , who has to put up with " grown-ups " showing disappointment with them as well as being upset at not being able to do what the other children do .
i agreed to my son starting school a year late due to his dyspraxia -lrb- after 3 years of nursery -rrb- to give him a chance of keeping up , skills-wise , with the other children , and it has worked out well .
alison bell , scotland my older daughter is 7 , and recently outperformed in her ks1 sats tests , gaining level 3 or 2a -lrb- expected is 2 -rrb- on all tests .
she can only just use a knife and fork , has difficulty following instructions in a group situation , had difficulty with speech when she started school , and did not talk at all until she was 30 months -lrb- although she could read before this -rrb- .
my younger daughter is 3 1/2 , and can not do any of the things mr bell wants - she has never said more than one word .
both daughters receive all my wife 's and my care , attention and love , and we strive with every waking hour to help them progress .
both have been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum , but both are making huge progress using special diets which remove wheat and milk products , but also all artificial colours , flavourings , processed and non-organic ingredients .
in my view it would be worth ofsted or some other government body investigating whether there are other influences on the trend in young children ' ! s behaviour than parenting .
mass - and cheaply-produced - foodstuffs would be a possible starting point .
neil , uk he was bored because he knew too much jenny , scotland my son only developed behavioural difficulties when he got to school proper - not otherwise .
and his problems were exacerbated by a head teacher lacking adequate training to deal with a family bereavement .
yes , he used a knife and fork the wrong way round - still does , but that 's an hereditary issue .
my husband and i did take time to talk , explain and show lots of things to our son ; what happened at school was that he was bored because he knew too much .
we did n't have enough money or resources to keep him off school or to send him to a school -lrb- none existed locally -rrb- which could expand on his knowledge whilst letting his emotional and social skills catch up with his intellect .
the system can not cope with children who develop at different rates in different skills and the back up for teachers and parents needs to be much more effectively targeted .
jenny , scotland many of the comments posted here today sum up exactly what the problem is with our society today - " it 's always somebody else 's fault " .
everyone must start taking responsibility for their actions .
this govt may not be my cup of tea , but i do n't have the bare faced cheek to blame them for my children 's behaviour !
i hear parents swearing at their kids and then tell them off when they use the same words .
children as young as 7 hanging around the streets after dark because parents say they ca n't watch them 24 hrs a day - hello !
yes you can if they misbehave , you are their parents !
we should all stop trying to blame somebody else and start parenting responsibly .
pete wilde , gb well , i 'm convinced that i 'm wasting my life working all hours just to see half my income disappear in taxes .
i 'm going to drop out , become a part time owl tickler , and spend more time with my -lrb- adored , sole , produced late in life -rrb- infant son .
now , which of you fine moral crusaders is going to volunteer to work even harder yourself in order to pay for me sponging off the state rather than contributing to it ?
speak up , i ca n't hear you .
colin macdonald , scotland the real problem is that in modern society there are so many interesting distractions john m , lyne meads , uk the same criticism is often levelled at teachers : students are not being adequately prepared for the wide world of work and leave school without even the basic 3rs .
the real problem is that in modern society there are so many interesting distractions especially for entertainment that any activity involving serious concentration and effort is becoming more difficult to first of all engage and then secondly to see through that many essential skills are not being learned .
this is as true of pre-school as it is of during school and even in adulthood .
the problem which must be tackled is of how to enable and encourage people to acquire skills which may require extended concentration and commitment .
if nothing is done to address this issue we 'll become a society of shallowness able only to press many buttons but eventually unable to supply the things which the buttons provide : empty heads will have nothing to fill them !
john m , lyne meads , uk if the child behaves well then that child can learn and catch up other skills very quickly .
so my opinion is to bring up children with good discipline which is that greatest responsibility of parents and teachers -lrb- at school -rrb- .
i have found that more working parents ' children behave well than housewives ' children .
mal , uk well , since the kids are not as able as they used to be , it 's a good job the gcses and a levels are getting easier to pass is n't it ?
joey , uk i spent 25 years teaching and part of the reason i changed careers was the deteriorating behaviour of the children .
i overheard parents in a cafe blaming the school for their child 's lack of table manners !
the year i left in 97 we had our first child enter the nursery still in nappies !
i have a friend in her 70s who has had to teach her grandchildren to use the toilet as her daughters are too busy working .
we used to teach basic cookery , sewing and parenting in " domestic science " classes , but these were lost many years ago .
perhaps it is time to revive them : for girls and boys !
jan , uk / us if parents have n't got the time to spend with their children , then why did they have them in the first place ?
it 's not society 's fault that people are too stupid to plan for their own futures !
blame house prices , blame working hours ... but god forbid you should blame yourself !
j brown , uk my daughter is four and can do buttons and use a knife and fork .
this is largely because when she was two i gave up work to look after her full time .
during this time i have received little government support due to my wife " earning too much " -lrb- we are paying more tax on less income because it only goes in to one wage packet and a higher tax band -rrb- .
nor has mr bell taken the trouble to come round my house and lend a hand .
we need tax breaks for couples with only one income and better support for working parents so that we can be the best that we can be .
john , uk if parents could prepare their children better , school would be less of a shock anthony , great britain i think that parents should be further encouraged to teach preschool , as it is such a large jump for the child who is left to watch tv , rather than learn to read which is often more than not left up to the teachers .
if parents could prepare their children better , school would be less of a shock and more enjoyable for the child and life would be made easier for the teachers who could concentrate on excelling the child 's performance much more .
anthony , great britain my mother has made the decision to keep my five year old brother away from school till the age of seven .
this is so that he can develop his basic three rs at his own rate without being pressed to learn faster than he ought .
this option has worked extremely well , he is blossoming in all aspects and thriving .
he learns through play and does not have half the cares of his fellows attending school .
i think that children should be free to develop at their own rate and only attend school at the age of seven at the least .
in short , no .
rob clohesy -lrb- 16 -rrb- , uk david bell is absolutely right - as a school governor , i know that there is a minority of parents -lrb- at all income levels -rrb- who are guilty of failing to take responsibility for giving their children a grounding in basic skills - nobody expects all children to be necessarily able to reach the same level of attainment when they start school , but allowing teaching time to be wasted trying to address a " shortfall " -lrb- which could have been avoided by some parents taking more of an interest in their children -rrb- is impossible to justify .
robert crosby , nottingham , uk so what else is new ?
when i started school in 1965 , i could n't do buttons , use a knife and fork , or tie my own shoelaces ... but i could read .
parenting skills are probably no worse now than they were back in the 1960s .
teaching skills on the other hand ...
alcuin , uk alcuin uk , perhaps you should think of doing some research before making such ill-informed suggestions about teaching skills .
as a teacher of some years , i have seen the standards of teaching rise phenomenally recently .
i have , however , also observed a very sad decline in parental interest and influence over their children .
many are too quick to point the finger at the teachers when their darling is behind on his / her coursework .
the fact is that children need to be encouraged to take responsibility for their learning , and the message needs to come loud and clear from the parents .
working parents should make no difference at all .
my own wife returned to work two weeks after the birth of our son .
you simply have to make the time to educate your children , or why bother having them ?
ant , uk ant -lrb- uk -rrb- gives a classic teacher response to criticism .
any shortcomings are the parent 's fault .
as a former teacher i know the reverse is usually true .
the typical attitude of many of my colleagues in the ' 70s was that most parents were not fit to have children !
parenting is even tougher now , with great commercial pressure on kids and more busybodies telling you how and how not to be a parent .
let 's face it , there is no such thing as an " ideal " mode of parenting .
circumstances differ even between siblings .
love your children , talk to them as much as possible , and they will do as well as they can .
tom , uk people must accept responsibility for their children 's education david phillips , uk t

kate brunstrom , 18 , was allegedly recorded by reporters from a tabloid newspaper driving along a 50mph limit road near llandudno junction , north wales , at 61mph and 69mph on two separate occasions .
her father has led a crackdown on speeding motorists , and recently compared a 71-year-old man to a " 17-year-old yob " for complaining about being fined .
the criminal prosecution service outside north wales is dealing with the investigation .
last week , the sun claimed its reporters had used a speed gun to record ms brunstrom breaking the limit while driving her family 's ford focus .
criticism a north wales police spokeswoman said at the time it would investigate claims of speeding against anybody .
now the paper has sent its evidence to the force and an investigation is underway .
a police spokesman said : " due to the sensitive nature of the allegations , the matter will be dealt with by the crown prosecution service outside the north wales area . "
mr brunstrom has spearheaded an anti-speeding campaign which has caught 32,333 drivers in five months .
but it has prompted criticism that officers from the force are spending too much time concentrating on speeding .
however , mr brunstrom has defended the stance , calling speeding " a form of anti-social behaviour " .

kate brunstrom , 18 , was allegedly recorded by reporters from a tabloid newspaper driving along a 50mph limit road near llandudno junction , north wales , at 61mph and 69mph on two separate occasions .
her father has led a crackdown on speeding motorists , and recently compared a 71-year-old man to a " 17-year-old yob " for complaining about being fined .
the criminal prosecution service outside north wales is dealing with the investigation .
last week , the sun claimed its reporters had used a speed gun to record ms brunstrom breaking the limit while driving her family 's ford focus .
criticism a north wales police spokeswoman said at the time it would investigate claims of speeding against anybody .
now the paper has sent its evidence to the force and an investigation is underway .
a police spokesman said : " due to the sensitive nature of the allegations , the matter will be dealt with by the crown prosecution service outside the north wales area . "
mr brunstrom has spearheaded an anti-speeding campaign which has caught 32,333 drivers in five months .
but it has prompted criticism that officers from the force are spending too much time concentrating on speeding .
however , mr brunstrom has defended the stance , calling speeding " a form of anti-social behaviour " .

so says david levin , head of phone software firm symbian , reviewing the firm 's future prospects .
he said the falling cost of putting extras , such as cameras , into handsets would mean big changes for the consumer electronics market .
but , he added , it would take time for consumers to start using all the features in their increasingly smart phones and perhaps longer for operators to work out ways to generate significant amounts of cash from new services .
digital doom mr levin said makers of personal digital assistants -lrb- pdas -rrb- and digital cameras were likely to suffer as phones became more powerful .
" the pda is dead , " mr levin told bbc news online .
he asked why anyone would opt for an expensive , bulky handheld computer when smartphones like the sonyericsson p800 were now available for about £ 200 .
he said the p800 and many others like it had onboard all the programs , such as e-mail , address book and calendar , which many people used to look for in a pda .
and , he said , makers of digital cameras could also be in for a shock .
" at some point in the next six-nine months there will be more digital cameras sold on mobiles than stand alone , " said mr levin .
already 70-80 % of phones sold in asia have a camera on-board and europeans look like they will follow this lead .
figures revealed by analysts gartner reveal that the arrival of camera phones has boosted handset sales .
according to gartner , during the second three months of 2003 total phone sales were 114.9 million units , 12 % higher than the same period in 2002 and 2 % up on the first three months of this year .
journey time mr levin said the cost of adding extra functions to phones was falling all the time .
as a result , he said , phones might become the camera , games machine , music player and radio that many people turn to first .
phone makers could soon be outselling camera firms but , he said , the killer application for mobile operators for the near future was likely to be voice calls .
it was going to take time for people to use all the functions they find in their handset , he said .
" we need to appreciate that human behaviour evolves and we can not just announce a technology and have mass adoption , " he said , " some things will hit quicker than others . "
many experts had under-estimated how long consumers took to adopt and adapt to new technologies and ways of doing things , said mr levin .
the fact that it was taking longer than originally thought for consumers to use their phones for more than talking was also leading some experts to under-estimate the long-term prospects for phone firms .
mr levin said symbian would do well out of the growing sales of smartphones .
in the first six months of 2003 there were 10 symbian-based phones on sale around the world produced by three licensees of the software maker 's operating system .
during those six months more than 2.68 million symbian devices were sold .
currently under development , said mr levin , were 26 phones by nine licensees .
one of the new firms to sign up for symbian was benq , the leading maker of mobiles in taiwan .
symbian as a company would break even when 20 million handsets using its software were sold per year , he said .

so says david levin , head of phone software firm symbian , reviewing the firm 's future prospects .
he said the falling cost of putting extras , such as cameras , into handsets would mean big changes for the consumer electronics market .
but , he added , it would take time for consumers to start using all the features in their increasingly smart phones and perhaps longer for operators to work out ways to generate significant amounts of cash from new services .
digital doom mr levin said makers of personal digital assistants -lrb- pdas -rrb- and digital cameras were likely to suffer as phones became more powerful .
" the pda is dead , " mr levin told bbc news online .
he asked why anyone would opt for an expensive , bulky handheld computer when smartphones like the sonyericsson p800 were now available for about £ 200 .
he said the p800 and many others like it had onboard all the programs , such as e-mail , address book and calendar , which many people used to look for in a pda .
and , he said , makers of digital cameras could also be in for a shock .
" at some point in the next six-nine months there will be more digital cameras sold on mobiles than stand alone , " said mr levin .
already 70-80 % of phones sold in asia have a camera on-board and europeans look like they will follow this lead .
figures revealed by analysts gartner reveal that the arrival of camera phones has boosted handset sales .
according to gartner , during the second three months of 2003 total phone sales were 114.9 million units , 12 % higher than the same period in 2002 and 2 % up on the first three months of this year .
journey time mr levin said the cost of adding extra functions to phones was falling all the time .
as a result , he said , phones might become the camera , games machine , music player and radio that many people turn to first .
phone makers could soon be outselling camera firms but , he said , the killer application for mobile operators for the near future was likely to be voice calls .
it was going to take time for people to use all the functions they find in their handset , he said .
" we need to appreciate that human behaviour evolves and we can not just announce a technology and have mass adoption , " he said , " some things will hit quicker than others . "
many experts had under-estimated how long consumers took to adopt and adapt to new technologies and ways of doing things , said mr levin .
the fact that it was taking longer than originally thought for consumers to use their phones for more than talking was also leading some experts to under-estimate the long-term prospects for phone firms .
mr levin said symbian would do well out of the growing sales of smartphones .
in the first six months of 2003 there were 10 symbian-based phones on sale around the world produced by three licensees of the software maker 's operating system .
during those six months more than 2.68 million symbian devices were sold .
currently under development , said mr levin , were 26 phones by nine licensees .
one of the new firms to sign up for symbian was benq , the leading maker of mobiles in taiwan .
symbian as a company would break even when 20 million handsets using its software were sold per year , he said .

tim martin , the firm 's chairman , also warned that the pub industry as a whole could be hit hard by the increasing burden .
he said pubs pay about 40 % of their turnover in taxes of one kind or another , and further increases in this burden will mean that pubs become less competitive and more expensive .
mr martin 's comments came as the pub group said full-year profits for the year to july rose 5 % to £ 56.1m -lrb- $ 89.76m -rrb- .

if it were to have hit , the 1.2 kilometre-wide -lrb- 0.75 mile -rrb- rock would have caused widespread damage and global climate change .
but new data indicates the earth will be safe on 21 march 2014 .
in fact , it always was .
asteroid 2003 qq47 will be elsewhere in the solar system , moving on an orbit that will be watched by astronomers just in case it becomes worrisome again , but that is highly unlikely .
' own goal ' the scare started with a press release from the relatively newly established near earth object information centre -lrb- neoic -rrb- .
funded with uk government money , it is based at the national space centre .
the neoic said that an object had just been found that might pose a small risk of colliding with us .
it was rated as torino scale 1 , " deserves special monitoring " .
it also said that any threat was likely to evaporate soon .
many astronomers were unimpressed .
they pointed out that torino scale 1 objects are found every few weeks .
and since new objects were often given an initial classification of t1 , in the absence of information , it would certainly be reduced to t0 , " no significance " , as more data came in , they explained .
the headlines about doomsday were predictable ; the date of 21 march 2014 became stuck in people 's minds , some astronomers moaned about an " own goal " , and the media declined to mention the all-clear when it came a day later .
if you think you have heard this type of thing before you are right .
perennially hazardous asteroids asteroid flaps are becoming as regular as the first cuckoo in spring .
we get about one a year .
in 1998 , there was 1997 xf11 due to strike in october 2028 .
it showed , unsurprisingly , that different groups of astronomers disagreed about the -lrb- low -rrb- chances of it striking us .
with new observations the risk went away .
there was 1999 an10 .
this taught astronomers a lot about how not to release their information about potentially hazardous objects to the public .
so , astronomers revised their rules for releasing information to the public .
the new millennium brought 2000 sg344 , a very small object , which might even be a spent rocket upper stage .
at one point , astronomers claimed that it had a 1 in 500 chance of striking the earth , so media attention was immediate and justified .
but within hours new calculations showed no impact was possible , and astronomers looked a little foolish .
the rules were changed , again .
roll on 2002 and 2002 mn , a small asteroid that whizzed by at about a third of the earth-moon distance - quite close really .
because this happened without astronomers realising it until after the event , some in the media suggested they had egg on their faces in not providing any warning .
the scientists replied , slightly off the point , that it did not matter as 2002 mn did not pose any danger anyway .
and then there was 2002 nt7 .
' most threatening object ' i have regard for 2002 nt7 , as far as one can for a rock that could threaten the earth , as i broke the story and it won me an award .
it had a large diameter and was described by one expert as " the most threatening object ever found in space " .
fortunately , and as predicted in my original report , the threat receded .
initially , astronomers said nothing about it .
they were following their media rules modified after the sg 344 incident .
after nt7 those rules were revised once again .
one thing is for certain .
there will be another object and another date for doomsday that will be retracted a day or so later .
and i wonder if we will soon begin to take no notice of false claims .
but then what happens when the big one comes ?

the neoic said that an object had just been found that might pose a small risk of colliding with us .
it was rated as torino scale 1 , " deserves special monitoring " .
it also said that any threat was likely to evaporate soon .
many astronomers were unimpressed .
they pointed out that torino scale 1 objects are found every few weeks .
and since new objects were often given an initial classification of t1 , in the absence of information , it would certainly be reduced to t0 , " no significance " , as more data came in , they explained .
the headlines about doomsday were predictable ; the date of 21 march 2014 became stuck in people 's minds , some astronomers moaned about an " own goal " , and the media declined to mention the all-clear when it came a day later .
if you think you have heard this type of thing before you are right .
perennially hazardous asteroids asteroid flaps are becoming as regular as the first cuckoo in spring .
we get about one a year .
in 1998 , there was 1997 xf11 due to strike in october 2028 .
it showed , unsurprisingly , that different groups of astronomers disagreed about the -lrb- low -rrb- chances of it striking us .
with new observations the risk went away .
there was 1999 an10 .
this taught astronomers a lot about how not to release their information about potentially hazardous objects to the public .
so , astronomers revised their rules for releasing information to the public .
the new millennium brought 2000 sg344 , a very small object , which might even be a spent rocket upper stage .
at one point , astronomers claimed that it had a 1 in 500 chance of striking the earth , so media attention was immediate and justified .
but within hours new calculations showed no impact was possible , and astronomers looked a little foolish .
the rules were changed , again .
roll on 2002 and 2002 mn , a small asteroid that whizzed by at about a third of the earth-moon distance - quite close really .
because this happened without astronomers realising it until after the event , some in the media suggested they had egg on their faces in not providing any warning .
the scientists replied , slightly off the point , that it did not matter as 2002 mn did not pose any danger anyway .
and then there was 2002 nt7 .
' most threatening object ' i have regard for 2002 nt7 , as far as one can for a rock that could threaten the earth , as i broke the story and it won me an award .
it had a large diameter and was described by one expert as " the most threatening object ever found in space " .
fortunately , and as predicted in my original report , the threat receded .
initially , astronomers said nothing about it .
they were following their media rules modified after the sg 344 incident .
after nt7 those rules were revised once again .
one thing is for certain .
there will be another object and another date for doomsday that will be retracted a day or so later .
and i wonder if we will soon begin to take no notice of false claims .
but then what happens when the big one comes ?

the bbc has learned local health planners are being forced into signing contracts for the new diagnostic and treatment centres .
surgeons claim the units - which the government says will cut waiting times for minor surgery - will drain nhs income by up to half , and limit their ability to treat patients with chronic eye disease .
they also predict the move could mean restricting training and research , the closure of smaller outreach clinics and redundancies .
" serious threat " health minister lord warner said there had been " misconceptions " about the reforms . "
you need a critical mass to attract the referrals and to provide the specialist expertise " nhs surgeon john elston the new centres would offer up to 250,000 operations a year , with the aim of taking pressure off local nhs services across the country , according to the department for health .
but specialists at oxford eye hospital - a leading uk centre specialising in eye surgery - have warned the viability of their unit will be threatened by the number of procedures private contractors have promised .
john elston , a consultant surgeon at the hospital , told bbc radio 4 's today programme the private scheme was " a serious threat " .
" the cataract work subsidises the work in chronic eye disease so it could well mean that we would lose numbers of our trainees and if we lose staff , then we lose the ability to offer the full range of services , " he said .
" you need a critical mass to attract the referrals and to provide the specialist expertise . "
mr elston said the unit was already set to meet government targets on waiting times .
not final primary care trusts -lrb- pcts -rrb- - which organise healthcare locally - were given a large amount of autonomy over where they choose to send their patients for treatment .
they are given control of 75 % of total health budgets for their region .
but when three thames valley pcts made a joint approach to nhs bosses asking to opt out of the diagnostic and treatment centre for their region , they were refused .
the department of health said it would create " insurmountable problems " in the viability of the contracts with the private firm , documents have revealed .
the cost of a cataract operation at one of the new centres , according to documents , would be more than under existing nhs services .
in a speech to nhs chief executives on thursday , health secretary john reid said : " we want to empower and enable all patients and clinicians to make shared and sustainable decisions about their health and social care needs . "
cataracts he added : " the nhs needs more money and autonomy going to the front line . "
" there are absolutely no plans to close down the oxford eye hospital as this unit will serve the whole of the thames valley " department of health spokesman in response to the comments from oxford , a spokesman for the department of health said final arrangements for the centres had yet to be agreed .
he said : " the diagnostic and treatment centre will be a series of mobile units that can travel across a wide area in order to meet patient need and will therefore be operating in areas beyond the oxford eye hospital 's catchment area .
" while these units will concentrate on simple cataract procedures the oxford eye hospital will continue to provide a wider ranging ophthalmic service for patients . "
" there are absolutely no plans to close down the oxford eye hospital as this unit will serve the whole of the thames valley .
" the consultants will now be actively discussing how they can work alongside the dtc in order to deliver the best possible ophthalmology services to the thames valley region . "
liberal democrat health spokesman evan harris - who brought the story to light - said the government had made it very clear the centres would be for additional capacity and that operations would not be transferred out of the nhs .
but it had now " reneged " on agreements about cost and the non-involvement of nhs staff , he claimed .
" it 's a breach of the promise .
it does n't offer value for money and , as we heard from the surgeons , it destabilises the nhs because the routine stuff , which is the simple stuff , subsidises the work they do , which they will be left with , which is chronic disease and the simple cases . "
shadow health secretary dr liam fox said : " john reid knows this is bad for patients , completely undermines his own diabetes national service framework , will devastate local eye services and is completely unnecessary . "
he accused the nhs of " bullying " local consultants in order to force the change through , adding : " john reid spent this week going round the uk , telling doctors and nurses how highly he values their services .
given this shocking evidence , what would he do to people he did n't like ? "
