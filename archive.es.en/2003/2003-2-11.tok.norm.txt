but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .

in the surprise hit german flick at the berlin film festival , an east german teen tries to recreate the communist lifestyle after the fall of the wall in order to save his ailing mother . sunday , 2:30 p.m. , berlinale palace cinema : one long joke ?
or a tale told to enlighten , illuminate and inform ?
those were the questions buzzing in the heads of those attending the first public screening of wolfgang becker ’ s " goodbye , lenin ! " on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl set at the time of the fall of the wall , becker ’ s new film is about an eastern german family that attempts to recreate east german life in order to save their ailing mother .
for months , the life of alex , played by young german actor daniel brühl -lrb- photo -rrb- , revolves around digging up relics from the former communist state , bribing the neighbors to play their old selves , and even making up his own gdr television .
it 's all part of an elaborate illusion he 's created in order to make sure his mother - who falls into a coma , missing one of history 's most-important chapters , and wakes up in a frail condition eight months later - doesn ’ t excite herself over the news of german reunification .
a film full of colorful images of brühl filling pickles from holland into legendary east german glasses of " spreewald pickles " or making up excuses for a coca-cola advertisement outside the sick mother ’ s window - the film offers both a reflection and a parody on the former gdr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.02.2003 german social democrats uneasy with chancellor 's course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the voice of the workers : members of ig metall take their message to the streets as unemployment rises , members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government are letting him know they are worried about his political course .
but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.02.2003 european observers react to nato crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alliance under pressure european defense analysts say this week 's iraq rift inside nato carries greater risks than sour relations between germany , france and the u.s. - it could force the military alliance into an existential crisis . the issue of a looming war in iraq continues to divide nations at every level of organization .
the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .
" think of the months after sept .
11 , 2001 .
france offered substantial help to the u.s. but got rejected .
that infuriated french officials . in belgium , the greens have threatened to leave the government coalition if the government goes to war .
and having general elections in two months time , this is not a thing prime minister verhofstadt wants . "
houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .
position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .
" this nato split has huge implications for the european union .
the new countries coming in are mostly pro-american , for genuine historical reasons , and this could cause problems when consulting as a whole on common foreign and security issues . "
marc houben had his own thoughts on the implications of the nato split for the eu .
" we used to think of a dominant european caucus in nato , but the real dominant caucus is the caucus of spain , italy , poland , and the uk -lrb- the friends of the united states -rrb- . "
still , although nato has seen better times , keohane maintains there is reason for guarded optimism .
the organization may be at the end of its life as a unified political and military alliance but , by embracing change in an ever-changing world , the organization can still be relevant in other areas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two nato states block turkey aid plan germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq .

the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .

houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .
position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .

the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .
" think of the months after sept .

france offered substantial help to the u.s. but got rejected .
that infuriated french officials . in belgium , the greens have threatened to leave the government coalition if the government goes to war .
and having general elections in two months time , this is not a thing prime minister verhofstadt wants . "
houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .
position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .
" this nato split has huge implications for the european union .
the new countries coming in are mostly pro-american , for genuine historical reasons , and this could cause problems when consulting as a whole on common foreign and security issues . "
marc houben had his own thoughts on the implications of the nato split for the eu .
" we used to think of a dominant european caucus in nato , but the real dominant caucus is the caucus of spain , italy , poland , and the uk -lrb- the friends of the united states -rrb- . "
still , although nato has seen better times , keohane maintains there is reason for guarded optimism .
the organization may be at the end of its life as a unified political and military alliance but , by embracing change in an ever-changing world , the organization can still be relevant in other areas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two nato states block turkey aid plan germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq .

skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant . skilled workers protest high taxes more than 16,000 german skilled workers and craftsmen protested against the government in berlin and munich on monday .
they say recent tax hikes and and expensive labor costs are ruining the country 's small- and medium-sized businesses .
guild representatives accuse the government of not doing enough to combat bureaucracy and reduce high taxation , and small companies feel overlooked . but german economic and labor minister wolfgang clement sought to reassure protestors and said the government planned to ease the burden on small companies by reducing non-labor wage costs .
court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .
the ruling applies to all cities and towns in the state .
number of organ donors drops the number of organ donors in germany has dropped slightly , the german foundation for organ donation -lrb- dso -rrb- reported on monday .
in a statement , dso , which has been coordinating organ donations in germany since 2000 , complained that many hospitals were still unwilling to cooperate or submit their data .
in 2002 , 1,020 donors gave organs , down nearly five percent from the previous year .
but the figure is still low , with an average of 12 out of a million germans donating organs compared to european leader spain , where there are 30 donations per million inhabitants .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .

skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant . skilled workers protest high taxes more than 16,000 german skilled workers and craftsmen protested against the government in berlin and munich on monday .
they say recent tax hikes and and expensive labor costs are ruining the country 's small- and medium-sized businesses .
guild representatives accuse the government of not doing enough to combat bureaucracy and reduce high taxation , and small companies feel overlooked . but german economic and labor minister wolfgang clement sought to reassure protestors and said the government planned to ease the burden on small companies by reducing non-labor wage costs .
court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .
the ruling applies to all cities and towns in the state .
number of organ donors drops the number of organ donors in germany has dropped slightly , the german foundation for organ donation -lrb- dso -rrb- reported on monday .
in a statement , dso , which has been coordinating organ donations in germany since 2000 , complained that many hospitals were still unwilling to cooperate or submit their data .
in 2002 , 1,020 donors gave organs , down nearly five percent from the previous year .
but the figure is still low , with an average of 12 out of a million germans donating organs compared to european leader spain , where there are 30 donations per million inhabitants .

or a tale told to enlighten , illuminate and inform ?
those were the questions buzzing in the heads of those attending the first public screening of wolfgang becker ’ s " goodbye , lenin ! " on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl set at the time of the fall of the wall , becker ’ s new film is about an eastern german family that attempts to recreate east german life in order to save their ailing mother .
for months , the life of alex , played by young german actor daniel brühl -lrb- photo -rrb- , revolves around digging up relics from the former communist state , bribing the neighbors to play their old selves , and even making up his own gdr television .
it 's all part of an elaborate illusion he 's created in order to make sure his mother - who falls into a coma , missing one of history 's most-important chapters , and wakes up in a frail condition eight months later - doesn ’ t excite herself over the news of german reunification .
a film full of colorful images of brühl filling pickles from holland into legendary east german glasses of " spreewald pickles " or making up excuses for a coca-cola advertisement outside the sick mother ’ s window - the film offers both a reflection and a parody on the former gdr .
at times , the film had the audience breathless with laughter .
but only 12 years have passed since the communists relinquished power and some showed their discomfort with the thought of making a joke of germany 's difficult split history .
5:00 p.m. , grand hyatt : at a press conference following the screening , director becker is joined by german actor daniel brühl , a boyish figure in his mid-20s with light brown hair and medium height .
a person sitting in the row behind me whispers , " a typical west german . "
" he 's got a face that does n't fit the role of an east berliner . "
indeed , brühl comes from cologne and he admits to the journalists gathered that he was never really interested in life on the other side of the german border .
" unification did n't interest us in cologne , " he recalls , grinning sheepishly .
the eastern german who plays his mother in the film , catrin sass , retorts : " not like us , we were always interested in what went on in the west ! "
although becker says he originally intended to cast only east germans to play east germans in the movie , he opted to put brühl and sass in the mother-son role as a reprisal of their work together in a crime movie five years earlier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.02.2003 german social democrats uneasy with chancellor 's course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the voice of the workers : members of ig metall take their message to the streets as unemployment rises , members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government are letting him know they are worried about his political course .
but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .

the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .
" think of the months after sept .
11 , 2001 .
france offered substantial help to the u.s. but got rejected .
that infuriated french officials . in belgium , the greens have threatened to leave the government coalition if the government goes to war .
and having general elections in two months time , this is not a thing prime minister verhofstadt wants . "
houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .
position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .
" this nato split has huge implications for the european union .
the new countries coming in are mostly pro-american , for genuine historical reasons , and this could cause problems when consulting as a whole on common foreign and security issues . "
marc houben had his own thoughts on the implications of the nato split for the eu .
" we used to think of a dominant european caucus in nato , but the real dominant caucus is the caucus of spain , italy , poland , and the uk -lrb- the friends of the united states -rrb- . "
still , although nato has seen better times , keohane maintains there is reason for guarded optimism .
the organization may be at the end of its life as a unified political and military alliance but , by embracing change in an ever-changing world , the organization can still be relevant in other areas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two nato states block turkey aid plan germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.02.2003 european observers react to nato crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alliance under pressure european defense analysts say this week 's iraq rift inside nato carries greater risks than sour relations between germany , france and the u.s. - it could force the military alliance into an existential crisis . the issue of a looming war in iraq continues to divide nations at every level of organization .
the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .
" think of the months after sept .
11 , 2001 .
france offered substantial help to the u.s. but got rejected .
that infuriated french officials . in belgium , the greens have threatened to leave the government coalition if the government goes to war .
and having general elections in two months time , this is not a thing prime minister verhofstadt wants . "
houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .

skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant . skilled workers protest high taxes more than 16,000 german skilled workers and craftsmen protested against the government in berlin and munich on monday .
they say recent tax hikes and and expensive labor costs are ruining the country 's small- and medium-sized businesses .
guild representatives accuse the government of not doing enough to combat bureaucracy and reduce high taxation , and small companies feel overlooked . but german economic and labor minister wolfgang clement sought to reassure protestors and said the government planned to ease the burden on small companies by reducing non-labor wage costs .
court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .
the ruling applies to all cities and towns in the state .
number of organ donors drops the number of organ donors in germany has dropped slightly , the german foundation for organ donation -lrb- dso -rrb- reported on monday .
in a statement , dso , which has been coordinating organ donations in germany since 2000 , complained that many hospitals were still unwilling to cooperate or submit their data .
in 2002 , 1,020 donors gave organs , down nearly five percent from the previous year .
but the figure is still low , with an average of 12 out of a million germans donating organs compared to european leader spain , where there are 30 donations per million inhabitants .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push .

those were the questions buzzing in the heads of those attending the first public screening of wolfgang becker ’ s " goodbye , lenin ! " on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl set at the time of the fall of the wall , becker ’ s new film is about an eastern german family that attempts to recreate east german life in order to save their ailing mother .
for months , the life of alex , played by young german actor daniel brühl -lrb- photo -rrb- , revolves around digging up relics from the former communist state , bribing the neighbors to play their old selves , and even making up his own gdr television .
it 's all part of an elaborate illusion he 's created in order to make sure his mother - who falls into a coma , missing one of history 's most-important chapters , and wakes up in a frail condition eight months later - doesn ’ t excite herself over the news of german reunification .
a film full of colorful images of brühl filling pickles from holland into legendary east german glasses of " spreewald pickles " or making up excuses for a coca-cola advertisement outside the sick mother ’ s window - the film offers both a reflection and a parody on the former gdr .
at times , the film had the audience breathless with laughter .
but only 12 years have passed since the communists relinquished power and some showed their discomfort with the thought of making a joke of germany 's difficult split history .

" unification did n't interest us in cologne , " he recalls , grinning sheepishly .
the eastern german who plays his mother in the film , catrin sass , retorts : " not like us , we were always interested in what went on in the west ! "
although becker says he originally intended to cast only east germans to play east germans in the movie , he opted to put brühl and sass in the mother-son role as a reprisal of their work together in a crime movie five years earlier .

the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .

position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .
" this nato split has huge implications for the european union .
the new countries coming in are mostly pro-american , for genuine historical reasons , and this could cause problems when consulting as a whole on common foreign and security issues . "
marc houben had his own thoughts on the implications of the nato split for the eu .
" we used to think of a dominant european caucus in nato , but the real dominant caucus is the caucus of spain , italy , poland , and the uk -lrb- the friends of the united states -rrb- . "

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .

that infuriated french officials . in belgium , the greens have threatened to leave the government coalition if the government goes to war .

houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .
position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .
" this nato split has huge implications for the european union .
the new countries coming in are mostly pro-american , for genuine historical reasons , and this could cause problems when consulting as a whole on common foreign and security issues . "
marc houben had his own thoughts on the implications of the nato split for the eu .
" we used to think of a dominant european caucus in nato , but the real dominant caucus is the caucus of spain , italy , poland , and the uk -lrb- the friends of the united states -rrb- . "
still , although nato has seen better times , keohane maintains there is reason for guarded optimism .

skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant . skilled workers protest high taxes more than 16,000 german skilled workers and craftsmen protested against the government in berlin and munich on monday .
they say recent tax hikes and and expensive labor costs are ruining the country 's small- and medium-sized businesses .
guild representatives accuse the government of not doing enough to combat bureaucracy and reduce high taxation , and small companies feel overlooked . but german economic and labor minister wolfgang clement sought to reassure protestors and said the government planned to ease the burden on small companies by reducing non-labor wage costs .
court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .
the ruling applies to all cities and towns in the state .
number of organ donors drops the number of organ donors in germany has dropped slightly , the german foundation for organ donation -lrb- dso -rrb- reported on monday .
in a statement , dso , which has been coordinating organ donations in germany since 2000 , complained that many hospitals were still unwilling to cooperate or submit their data .
in 2002 , 1,020 donors gave organs , down nearly five percent from the previous year .
but the figure is still low , with an average of 12 out of a million germans donating organs compared to european leader spain , where there are 30 donations per million inhabitants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.02.2003 german social democrats uneasy with chancellor 's course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the voice of the workers : members of ig metall take their message to the streets as unemployment rises , members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government are letting him know they are worried about his political course .
but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .

the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .
" think of the months after sept .
11 , 2001 .
france offered substantial help to the u.s. but got rejected .
that infuriated french officials . in belgium , the greens have threatened to leave the government coalition if the government goes to war .
and having general elections in two months time , this is not a thing prime minister verhofstadt wants . "
houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .
position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .
" this nato split has huge implications for the european union .
the new countries coming in are mostly pro-american , for genuine historical reasons , and this could cause problems when consulting as a whole on common foreign and security issues . "
marc houben had his own thoughts on the implications of the nato split for the eu .
" we used to think of a dominant european caucus in nato , but the real dominant caucus is the caucus of spain , italy , poland , and the uk -lrb- the friends of the united states -rrb- . "
still , although nato has seen better times , keohane maintains there is reason for guarded optimism .
the organization may be at the end of its life as a unified political and military alliance but , by embracing change in an ever-changing world , the organization can still be relevant in other areas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two nato states block turkey aid plan germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .

" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .
" if promises are not kept , then the politicians will have to create laws , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .

skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant . skilled workers protest high taxes more than 16,000 german skilled workers and craftsmen protested against the government in berlin and munich on monday .
they say recent tax hikes and and expensive labor costs are ruining the country 's small- and medium-sized businesses .
guild representatives accuse the government of not doing enough to combat bureaucracy and reduce high taxation , and small companies feel overlooked . but german economic and labor minister wolfgang clement sought to reassure protestors and said the government planned to ease the burden on small companies by reducing non-labor wage costs .
court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .
the ruling applies to all cities and towns in the state .
number of organ donors drops the number of organ donors in germany has dropped slightly , the german foundation for organ donation -lrb- dso -rrb- reported on monday .
in a statement , dso , which has been coordinating organ donations in germany since 2000 , complained that many hospitals were still unwilling to cooperate or submit their data .
in 2002 , 1,020 donors gave organs , down nearly five percent from the previous year .
but the figure is still low , with an average of 12 out of a million germans donating organs compared to european leader spain , where there are 30 donations per million inhabitants .

those were the questions buzzing in the heads of those attending the first public screening of wolfgang becker ’ s " goodbye , lenin ! " on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl set at the time of the fall of the wall , becker ’ s new film is about an eastern german family that attempts to recreate east german life in order to save their ailing mother .
for months , the life of alex , played by young german actor daniel brühl -lrb- photo -rrb- , revolves around digging up relics from the former communist state , bribing the neighbors to play their old selves , and even making up his own gdr television .
it 's all part of an elaborate illusion he 's created in order to make sure his mother - who falls into a coma , missing one of history 's most-important chapters , and wakes up in a frail condition eight months later - doesn ’ t excite herself over the news of german reunification .
a film full of colorful images of brühl filling pickles from holland into legendary east german glasses of " spreewald pickles " or making up excuses for a coca-cola advertisement outside the sick mother ’ s window - the film offers both a reflection and a parody on the former gdr .

it 's all part of an elaborate illusion he 's created in order to make sure his mother - who falls into a coma , missing one of history 's most-important chapters , and wakes up in a frail condition eight months later - doesn ’ t excite herself over the news of german reunification .
a film full of colorful images of brühl filling pickles from holland into legendary east german glasses of " spreewald pickles " or making up excuses for a coca-cola advertisement outside the sick mother ’ s window - the film offers both a reflection and a parody on the former gdr .
at times , the film had the audience breathless with laughter .
but only 12 years have passed since the communists relinquished power and some showed their discomfort with the thought of making a joke of germany 's difficult split history .
5:00 p.m. , grand hyatt : at a press conference following the screening , director becker is joined by german actor daniel brühl , a boyish figure in his mid-20s with light brown hair and medium height .
a person sitting in the row behind me whispers , " a typical west german . "
" he 's got a face that does n't fit the role of an east berliner . "
indeed , brühl comes from cologne and he admits to the journalists gathered that he was never really interested in life on the other side of the german border .
" unification did n't interest us in cologne , " he recalls , grinning sheepishly .
the eastern german who plays his mother in the film , catrin sass , retorts : " not like us , we were always interested in what went on in the west ! "
although becker says he originally intended to cast only east germans to play east germans in the movie , he opted to put brühl and sass in the mother-son role as a reprisal of their work together in a crime movie five years earlier .
becker said he hoped to reprise the chemistry here . - louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .
on monday evening , the chancellor launched an attempt to win over the labor unions in the debate to create jobs .
schröder met with klaus zwickel , who heads the country 's 2.8 million-member ig metall union .
the topic of the talks was the chancellor 's alliance for jobs , the forum at which leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government have met off and on again in an attempt to find ways to create jobs .
the alliance collapsed last week under the weight of union opposition to new suggestions made by an employer group .
following the meeting , schröder said he wanted to revive the talks soon .
but he also indicated that the talks would touch on sensitive issues , saying he wanted to hold a meeting " without an agenda and without any taboos . "
zwickel 's response followed on tuesday morning .
the union leader said in a radio interview that he saw no reason to resume the talks unless some legal commitment was built into the process .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .
" we can live with that , " she said .
this interpretation of comments was challenged later in the day by the social democrats ' general secretary , olaf scholz .
but on tuesday afternoon , sources acknowledged that the government was considering the possibility of increasing deficit spending as a way of reviving the stagnating economy . disagreement among leadership even though schröder was able to calm nahles and her supporters , he knows the upper levels of the party disagree on ways to combat unemployment .
it pits the party 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering parliamentary group leader , franz müntefering , against wolfgang clement , the former state premier whom schröder brought in after his re-election in september to be his super minister of labor and economics .
the issue involves stringent rules on layoffs .
to many of the country 's economists , the regulations act as a brake on employment .
in the days leading up to the elections , clement suggested that the rules be loosened .
this suggestion produced attacks during monday 's meeting from party members , who said his comments had contributed to the devastating losses at the polls , the newspaper berliner zeitung reported on tuesday .
müntefering went public with his criticism on tuesday morning , defending the layoff protections as well as the country 's use of industry-wide wage agreements .
such regulations are a " good thing for germany , " he said in a television interview .
" they are also essential for keeping the economy competitive . "
chancellor courts union the debate is unlikely to go away soon as schröder looks for ways to cut the 11.1 percent jobless rate .
employers see a loosening of the layoff protection rules as one essential means to create jobs .
but the unions think such changes would amount to the surrender of valued social protection .

court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.02.2003 european observers react to nato crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alliance under pressure european defense analysts say this week 's iraq rift inside nato carries greater risks than sour relations between germany , france and the u.s. - it could force the military alliance into an existential crisis . the issue of a looming war in iraq continues to divide nations at every level of organization .
the united nations security council , the transatlantic relationship and now nato are all split on the best way to resolve the crisis .
with france , germany and belgium refusing to support any nato protection for turkey in the event of an attack on iraq , saying it would constitute a " logic for war " and a failure for diplomacy , a serious rift has developed in the organization .
a nail in nato 's coffin ?
daniel keohane , an expert on nato from the center of european reform in london , told dw-world that the signs for the alliance are ominous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato member flags in prague .
" this is hugely significant for the future of nato , " he said .
" it puts not only the political future of the organization in doubt but also any military role it may have . "
he said the credibility of nato has been put into question as a result of several actions , including the americans ' bypassing nato in the war on terror and the french opposing the use of nato troops ' out of field ' , that is taking over missions in afghanistan and kosovo .
while at one time it might have looked as if it would be the americans pushing nato into irrelevance , it seems that parts of europe have lost interest in the treaty organization .
" it could possibly be the final nail in the organization 's coffin , " keohane said .
peter volten , professor of international relations at the university of gröningen and director of the center for european security studies also believes that the organization has been seriously damaged by the split .
" do n't be surprised if the whole of nato comes together today and shows a united front .
to the outside world , the message will be one of unity but the damage will have been done .
the building will remain in brussels but the spirit within will be broken . "
american pressure attributed to split professor volten said that he believes the seriousness of the nato split is a manifestation of external pressure from the bush administration .
" it is not a new thing for nato states to disagree , " he said . " to my knowledge , there has never been a unanimous vote in nato .
the organization is built on the ' argument-counter argument ' model as a way of resolving issues .
however , this does not seem to be the u.s. way . "
professor volten told dw-world that he is of the opinion that the seriousness of this disagreement is a direct consequence of the american administration 's extreme stance and determination for war .
" the belief that what they -lrb- the united states -rrb- are doing is right makes it very difficult for sovereign states in europe .
decisions are no longer being made on the merits of arguments but purely on beliefs , " he said .
professor volten suggested that the position of those countries opposing american influence has as much to do with bruised egos as it does with political principles .
marc houben , an expert on european security and defense policy at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told dw-world that he thought there were definite factors other than international political principles at work .
" think of the months after sept .
11 , 2001 .
france offered substantial help to the u.s. but got rejected .
that infuriated french officials . in belgium , the greens have threatened to leave the government coalition if the government goes to war .
and having general elections in two months time , this is not a thing prime minister verhofstadt wants . "
houben added that germany 's position was inextricably linked to the weakening of chancellor gerhard schröder 's leadership and his electoral promise not to go to war .
position and role must be reconsidered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and bush .
while confusion at nato reigns , daniel keohane said it is difficult to predict what the short-term effects of the current division will be .
but he added that nato will have to reconsider its role , although in his opinion it is unlikely that france and belgium will maintain their position of opposing the defense of turkey .
" but if they do , it will be shocking and it will quicken the process of nato 's death , " keohane said .
effect on europe could be disastrous " the effect on europe of this position could mean the isolation of germany and could spell disaster for the transatlantic alliance .
the americans would have to go outside the un with the willing " gang of 8 " leaders who signed the european letter of support .
the french and germans , if they maintain their stance , would not trust the others and nato would collapse , " said keohane .
professor volten sees more integral problems facing the european union in the future .
" this nato split has huge implications for the european union .
the new countries coming in are mostly pro-american , for genuine historical reasons , and this could cause problems when consulting as a whole on common foreign and security issues . "
marc houben had his own thoughts on the implications of the nato split for the eu .
" we used to think of a dominant european caucus in nato , but the real dominant caucus is the caucus of spain , italy , poland , and the uk -lrb- the friends of the united states -rrb- . "
still , although nato has seen better times , keohane maintains there is reason for guarded optimism .
the organization may be at the end of its life as a unified political and military alliance but , by embracing change in an ever-changing world , the organization can still be relevant in other areas . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two nato states block turkey aid plan germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq .

in the surprise hit german flick at the berlin film festival , an east german teen tries to recreate the communist lifestyle after the fall of the wall in order to save his ailing mother . sunday , 2:30 p.m. , berlinale palace cinema : one long joke ?
or a tale told to enlighten , illuminate and inform ?
those were the questions buzzing in the heads of those attending the first public screening of wolfgang becker ’ s " goodbye , lenin ! " on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl set at the time of the fall of the wall , becker ’ s new film is about an eastern german family that attempts to recreate east german life in order to save their ailing mother .
for months , the life of alex , played by young german actor daniel brühl -lrb- photo -rrb- , revolves around digging up relics from the former communist state , bribing the neighbors to play their old selves , and even making up his own gdr television .
it 's all part of an elaborate illusion he 's created in order to make sure his mother - who falls into a coma , missing one of history 's most-important chapters , and wakes up in a frail condition eight months later - doesn ’ t excite herself over the news of german reunification .
a film full of colorful images of brühl filling pickles from holland into legendary east german glasses of " spreewald pickles " or making up excuses for a coca-cola advertisement outside the sick mother ’ s window - the film offers both a reflection and a parody on the former gdr .
at times , the film had the audience breathless with laughter .
but only 12 years have passed since the communists relinquished power and some showed their discomfort with the thought of making a joke of germany 's difficult split history .
5:00 p.m. , grand hyatt : at a press conference following the screening , director becker is joined by german actor daniel brühl , a boyish figure in his mid-20s with light brown hair and medium height .
a person sitting in the row behind me whispers , " a typical west german . "
" he 's got a face that does n't fit the role of an east berliner . "
indeed , brühl comes from cologne and he admits to the journalists gathered that he was never really interested in life on the other side of the german border .
" unification did n't interest us in cologne , " he recalls , grinning sheepishly .
the eastern german who plays his mother in the film , catrin sass , retorts : " not like us , we were always interested in what went on in the west ! "
although becker says he originally intended to cast only east germans to play east germans in the movie , he opted to put brühl and sass in the mother-son role as a reprisal of their work together in a crime movie five years earlier .
becker said he hoped to reprise the chemistry here . - louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant . skilled workers protest high taxes more than 16,000 german skilled workers and craftsmen protested against the government in berlin and munich on monday .
they say recent tax hikes and and expensive labor costs are ruining the country 's small- and medium-sized businesses .
guild representatives accuse the government of not doing enough to combat bureaucracy and reduce high taxation , and small companies feel overlooked . but german economic and labor minister wolfgang clement sought to reassure protestors and said the government planned to ease the burden on small companies by reducing non-labor wage costs .
court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .
the ruling applies to all cities and towns in the state .
number of organ donors drops the number of organ donors in germany has dropped slightly , the german foundation for organ donation -lrb- dso -rrb- reported on monday .
in a statement , dso , which has been coordinating organ donations in germany since 2000 , complained that many hospitals were still unwilling to cooperate or submit their data .
in 2002 , 1,020 donors gave organs , down nearly five percent from the previous year .
but the figure is still low , with an average of 12 out of a million germans donating organs compared to european leader spain , where there are 30 donations per million inhabitants .

in the surprise hit german flick at the berlin film festival , an east german teen tries to recreate the communist lifestyle after the fall of the wall in order to save his ailing mother . sunday , 2:30 p.m. , berlinale palace cinema : one long joke ?
or a tale told to enlighten , illuminate and inform ?
those were the questions buzzing in the heads of those attending the first public screening of wolfgang becker ’ s " goodbye , lenin ! " on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl set at the time of the fall of the wall , becker ’ s new film is about an eastern german family that attempts to recreate east german life in order to save their ailing mother .
for months , the life of alex , played by young german actor daniel brühl -lrb- photo -rrb- , revolves around digging up relics from the former communist state , bribing the neighbors to play their old selves , and even making up his own gdr television .
it 's all part of an elaborate illusion he 's created in order to make sure his mother - who falls into a coma , missing one of history 's most-important chapters , and wakes up in a frail condition eight months later - doesn ’ t excite herself over the news of german reunification .
a film full of colorful images of brühl filling pickles from holland into legendary east german glasses of " spreewald pickles " or making up excuses for a coca-cola advertisement outside the sick mother ’ s window - the film offers both a reflection and a parody on the former gdr .
at times , the film had the audience breathless with laughter .
but only 12 years have passed since the communists relinquished power and some showed their discomfort with the thought of making a joke of germany 's difficult split history .
5:00 p.m. , grand hyatt : at a press conference following the screening , director becker is joined by german actor daniel brühl , a boyish figure in his mid-20s with light brown hair and medium height .
a person sitting in the row behind me whispers , " a typical west german . "
" he 's got a face that does n't fit the role of an east berliner . "
indeed , brühl comes from cologne and he admits to the journalists gathered that he was never really interested in life on the other side of the german border .

they say recent tax hikes and and expensive labor costs are ruining the country 's small- and medium-sized businesses .

court says it 's mandatory to shelter homeless municipalities are required to offer shelter to homeless people if they ask for it .
according to a decision by the administrative court of the state of hesse in central germany it is a civic duty to accommodate homeless individuals regardless of their most recent place of residence or the cause for the loss of the permanent residence .
the ruling applies to all cities and towns in the state .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .

but , for now , he has been able to ease the concerns . with war looming in iraq , chancellor gerhard schröder has been able to dampen an internal party debate that spilled out into the public on ways to solve germany 's most pressing domestic issue - the growing legion of 4.6 million jobless citizens .
but as he looks to the future , schröder sees the issue posing as a source of long-term internal strife .
the latest debate began after schröder 's social democrats suffered two disastrous defeats in state elections on feb .
2 .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the party was driven out of the premier 's office after 13 years in power , and in the central state of hesse , it watched the christian democrats grab an absolute majority .
social democrats aligned with former german parliament member andrea nahles then issued an appeal to the party 's leadership .
" a change of course in financial and economic policies is an absolute necessity , " the group said in a declaration after the elections .
the group also was quick to point out just where the change of course should begin - on the stability pact that governs the euro and , specifically , its strict requirement that a country 's budget deficit may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" the question is whether our attempt to reach this goal will strangle the economy or whether we will give priority to promoting more growth and less unemployment , " the declaration said .
targets of criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel the declaration was directed at , among others , finance minister hans eichel , who has the task of keeping the budget under control .
it is a task that has defeated eichel at times .
his budget for 2002 is under scrutiny by eu officials to determine whether germany should pay fines for running a deficit of 3.8 percent .
eichel also has until may 21 to cut the budget deficit for 2003 from 3.7 percent to 2.75 percent .
during a closed-door meeting of the party 's upper-level leadership monday , schröder was able to address some of the concerns and apparently end the group 's worries - at least for now .
nahles said the chancellor promised to launch a new european initiative to promote economic growth and raised the possibility of veering off the consolidation course mandated by the pact .

nato ructions the uproar in nato after france and belgium blocked alliance plans to begin shipping military equipment to turkey generates comment in both western and eastern europe , not least in the russian press .
" the americans are in shock , the europeans are shrugging their shoulders .
it is not clear how the situation will develop next , " comments the leading daily izvestiya . "
national and populist interests weigh more heavily than internal solidarity which is nato 's foundation " berlingske tidende " the thing the bush administration was most afraid of happened yesterday - the european coalition of opponents of war in iraq , headed by france and germany , has moved from words to concrete deeds .
and it did so using a lever to which it had access - membership of nato . "
" nato vetoes itself - france performs a turkish demarche , " says the mass-circulation daily moskovskiy komsomolets .
a headline in komsomolskaya pravda proclaims " the threat of war splits nato " .
denmark 's information writes of " monday 's drama at nato headquarters " noting that " the parties have entered the decisive trial of strength " . "
will it be at all possible to keep the military alliance together ? "
dagens nyheter washington is using nato unity as a means to twist the arms of france and germany , it argues , suggesting a way around the impasse is to " defer the question of military support for turkey until after the security council has met and taken a decision . "
describing the nato crisis as " deeply serious " , another danish daily , berlingske tidende , says it encourages saddam hussein " to continue his tricks with the weapons inspectors and the global community " .
it also fears that by allowing " national and populist interests to weigh more heavily than the internal solidarity which is nato 's foundation and justification " , there will be serious long-term repercussions for nato .
across the water in non-nato sweden , stockholm 's dagens nyheter considers that france and germany have created " the worst crisis in the alliance 's history " .
it is " probably only a matter of time " before france , germany and belgium are forced to back down by other nato countries , but if they remain defiant , the usa and other alliance partners will help turkey by circumventing nato , believes the daily .
" the question will then be if it will be at all possible to keep the almost 54-year-old military alliance together . "
transatlantic rift russia 's defence ministry newspaper krasnaya zvezda views favourably moscow 's stand faced with what is described as the " open enmity " between washington and some european nations .
" moscow has to resolve a complex political brain-twister , in which the coincidence of interests with the leaders of european integration on a number of issues , notably iraq , has to be combined with the goal of preserving good relations with washington . "
iraq is only an indicator of a general cooling in relations between the old and new worlds " itogi " it is precisely this interaction with different centres of power which can be seen as a sensible policy in the conditions of a multi-polar world . "
the russian business weekly itogi is not quite so sanguine .
" even if colin powell had presented the un with an atomic bomb confiscated from saddam , the europeans would have been unlikely to agree to start a war .
iraq is only an indicator of a general cooling in relations between the old and new worlds , " it says in a piece headlined " freezing point " .
" russia 's task is the hardest of all - to uphold its own interests , whilst skilfully manoeuvring between the two ' poles of cold ' . "
france 's le monde succinctly expresses the state of us-french relations in a front-page headline : " iraq : paris exasperates washington " . "
never before has such a right and important stance been so badly justified as the german ' no ' to a war against iraq " sueddeutsche zeitung le figaro also leads on the effects of the iraqi crisis on relations between europe and the us : " iraq deepens transatlantic rift . "
the paper notes that us secretary of state colin powell has failed to convince the french of the need for military action against iraq , adding that only 14 % feel it necessary to intervene in iraq , according to an opinion poll .
unholy trinity the munich based sueddeutsche zeitung calls the german government a " pathetically bad advocate of a good cause " over its stance on war against iraq .
" never before in german history has such a right and important stance been so badly justified as the german ' no ' to a war against iraq .
" in a situation where the chancellor , his defence minister and his foreign minister should act as a trinity , ie three individuals rooting for the same cause , we are faced with a panicking schroeder , a muttering struck and a desperate fischer . "
" schroeder 's position against an attack on iraq is in stark contrast to aznar 's eagerness " sueddeutsche zeitung the paper concludes that differences between foreign minister and chancellor are not unheard of , but none of them have been so damaging to germany in the eyes of the world .
sueddeutsche zeitung also comments on tuesday 's german-spanish summit in lanzarote .
" whoever finds the berlin winter too cold will certainly enjoy an official visit to the canaries . "
however , not all is likely to be sweetness and light .
" schroeder 's position against an attack on iraq is in stark contrast to aznar 's eagerness , he never misses an opportunity to present himself as loyal ally to us president george bush . "
and germany is no longer an example to spain , with the former 's economy waning , while the latter 's is buoyant , adds the daily .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

the paper notes that us secretary of state colin powell has failed to convince the french of the need for military action against iraq , adding that only 14 % feel it necessary to intervene in iraq , according to an opinion poll .
unholy trinity the munich based sueddeutsche zeitung calls the german government a " pathetically bad advocate of a good cause " over its stance on war against iraq .
" never before in german history has such a right and important stance been so badly justified as the german ' no ' to a war against iraq .
" in a situation where the chancellor , his defence minister and his foreign minister should act as a trinity , ie three individuals rooting for the same cause , we are faced with a panicking schroeder , a muttering struck and a desperate fischer . "
schroeder 's position against an attack on iraq is in stark contrast to aznar 's eagerness sueddeutsche zeitung the paper concludes that differences between foreign minister and chancellor are not unheard of , but none of them have been so damaging to germany in the eyes of the world .
sueddeutsche zeitung also comments on tuesday 's german-spanish summit in lanzarote .
" whoever finds the berlin winter too cold will certainly enjoy an official visit to the canaries . "
however , not all is likely to be sweetness and light .
" schroeder 's position against an attack on iraq is in stark contrast to aznar 's eagerness , he never misses an opportunity to present himself as loyal ally to us president george bush . "
and germany is no longer an example to spain , with the former 's economy waning , while the latter 's is buoyant , adds the daily .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

the rebels are hoping for key positions in the defence and interior ministries chairman of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- president john kufuor of ghana said after the talks in the ivorian capital , yamoussoukro , that mr diarra 's appointment was important because weeks after the marcoussis accord people were disturbed not to see its implementation .
the rebels , who control the north and much of the west of ivory coast , have threatened to march on the south coast seat of power , abidjan , if mr gbagbo does not apply the accord by friday .
they declined an invitation to attend the summit on monday , saying they were not prepared to renegotiate what had already been agreed in paris .
consensus figure as far as they are concerned , this includes them getting key ministerial posts in the defence and interior ministries .
but mr kufuor was hopeful that mr diarra 's appointment might go some way to appeasing the rebels .
seydou diarra , a muslim northerner who headed the country 's national reconciliation forum in 2001 , is widely viewed as a consensus figure who may be able to bring the country 's warring factions back to peace .
at the conclusion of the summit in yamoussoukro , mr gbagbo formally asked him to begin composing the new national reconciliation government .
but a little ominously , the president told his new prime minister " i tried to read your first draft but found it difficult to cipher your illegible handwriting . "
while the marcoussis accord sets out the need for a strong prime minister in charge of government , mr gbagbo made it clear in a speech last friday that he will maintain his right of veto over any decision , including the choice of new ministers .
undeterred , mr diarra said he would begin consulting immediately all over the country .
