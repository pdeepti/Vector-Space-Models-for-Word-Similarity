it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .
but the president is intent on expanding his rule over the land , from kabul into the furthest province .
and he makes unmistakably clear that the only way this can be achieved is through years of international support : military , political and financial . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato approves expanding afghanistan mission nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .
but the president is intent on expanding his rule over the land , from kabul into the furthest province .
and he makes unmistakably clear that the only way this can be achieved is through years of international support : military , political and financial . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato approves expanding afghanistan mission nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .
however , the couple ’ s marriage endured the early hardships and when prince claus died in october 2002 , the country mourned the loss of the most prominent voice behind dutch-german ties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch queen embroiled in own feud royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen -lrb- march 14 , 2003 -rrb- . media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .
but the president is intent on expanding his rule over the land , from kabul into the furthest province .
and he makes unmistakably clear that the only way this can be achieved is through years of international support : military , political and financial . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato approves expanding afghanistan mission nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .

why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .

the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.10.2003 authorities to close muslim school in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14 million euro school is the focus of terror investigations .
after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .
the state representative karsli himself made the news last year when he tried to switch membership from the green party to the neo-liberal free democrats and ignited a debate over racisim and anti-semitism in german politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tv show claims bonn is center for radical islam german public television ard draws attention to growing islamic fundamentalism in bonn -lrb- oct .

even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .

back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .

the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .

only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .

the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .
however , the couple ’ s marriage endured the early hardships and when prince claus died in october 2002 , the country mourned the loss of the most prominent voice behind dutch-german ties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch queen embroiled in own feud royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen -lrb- march 14 , 2003 -rrb- .

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .

with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .
the state representative karsli himself made the news last year when he tried to switch membership from the green party to the neo-liberal free democrats and ignited a debate over racisim and anti-semitism in german politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tv show claims bonn is center for radical islam german public television ard draws attention to growing islamic fundamentalism in bonn -lrb- oct .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .
however , the couple ’ s marriage endured the early hardships and when prince claus died in october 2002 , the country mourned the loss of the most prominent voice behind dutch-german ties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch queen embroiled in own feud royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen -lrb- march 14 , 2003 -rrb- .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .
however , the couple ’ s marriage endured the early hardships and when prince claus died in october 2002 , the country mourned the loss of the most prominent voice behind dutch-german ties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch queen embroiled in own feud royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen -lrb- march 14 , 2003 -rrb- .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .

both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.10.2003 authorities to close muslim school in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14 million euro school is the focus of terror investigations .
after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .
however , the couple ’ s marriage endured the early hardships and when prince claus died in october 2002 , the country mourned the loss of the most prominent voice behind dutch-german ties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch queen embroiled in own feud royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen -lrb- march 14 , 2003 -rrb- .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .
but the president is intent on expanding his rule over the land , from kabul into the furthest province .
and he makes unmistakably clear that the only way this can be achieved is through years of international support : military , political and financial . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato approves expanding afghanistan mission nato 's 19 member states agreed to expand the peacekeeping mission outside the afghan capital kabul .

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.10.2003 authorities to close muslim school in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14 million euro school is the focus of terror investigations .
after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.10.2003 racism overshadows swiss elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how do the jews get their money ? " this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .

the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .

with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.10.2003 authorities to close muslim school in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14 million euro school is the focus of terror investigations .
after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .
the state representative karsli himself made the news last year when he tried to switch membership from the green party to the neo-liberal free democrats and ignited a debate over racisim and anti-semitism in german politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tv show claims bonn is center for radical islam german public television ard draws attention to growing islamic fundamentalism in bonn -lrb- oct .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .

the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .

why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .

in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .

without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .

germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .

but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .
however , the couple ’ s marriage endured the early hardships and when prince claus died in october 2002 , the country mourned the loss of the most prominent voice behind dutch-german ties . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch queen embroiled in own feud royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen -lrb- march 14 , 2003 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.10.2003 authorities to close muslim school in bonn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14 million euro school is the focus of terror investigations .
after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .
the state representative karsli himself made the news last year when he tried to switch membership from the green party to the neo-liberal free democrats and ignited a debate over racisim and anti-semitism in german politics . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tv show claims bonn is center for radical islam german public television ard draws attention to growing islamic fundamentalism in bonn -lrb- oct .

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

" this poster asks as part of an anti-racism campaign .
the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .
responding with a campaign of its own , an anti-racism organization is ruffling a few feathers . in the weeks leading up to the swiss parliamentary elections on october 19th , charges of racism have been levied against the party currently leading in the polls , the far-right swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
with a mix of anti-immigrant and anti-eu policies , the svp narrowly won the last round of elections in 1999 . this time around , with a more aggressive overtly anti-immigrant campaign , they are hoping to widen their margin of victory .
but a swiss anti-racism organization is trying to stop them in their tracks . anti-immigrant posters and comments spark controversy the svp recently provoked controversy , when it released a poster featuring a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism , the poster was withdrawn .
the leader of the svp , christoph blocher , a swiss millionaire businessman , offered no apology . another poster released by the party was entitled " our dear foreigners " and was accompanied by police mug shots of criminals , none of whom , the party claims , are swiss . via these posters , party leaders hoped to send a powerful message .
and recent comments by svp members makes that message very clear .
will eckler , an svp member , told the bbc , " we need foreigners to work in switzerland and they are well paid , but we do n't need scroungers who cost money , and the criminals should be kicked out or interned . " growing fears of immigrants in switzerland foreigners currently comprise 20 percent of the swiss population , and members of the svp would like to see that percentage decrease - and they 're betting on the fact that a majority of the swiss feel the same way . currently holding 25.3 percent of the vote , according to the bern-based gfs institute , svp members are exploiting fears of this rising immigrant population , blatantly employing anti-foreigner propaganda to raise their lead in the poles and claim a more significant role in swiss government . if successful , more influence for the svp in government could mean more anti-immigrant legislation , like the 2002 svp-sponsored proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was only narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voting against the plan .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees , ruud lubbers , who was critical of the plan , said that had the proposal passed , switzerland would have the toughest anti-immigration laws in all of europe . an anti-racism organization challenges stereotypes in this cold climate where the nation 's asylum seekers only enjoy a slim margin of support among the swiss population , the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism has launched a nationwide campaign to challenge stereotypes .
the images employed by the campaign are in-your-face depictions of common stereotypes held about foreigners , and they have proven controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " where do kosovers get their car radios ? " - " in a shop , just like the rest of us . "
a jewish face smiles out from the cinema screen , and a caption asks , " how do the jews get their money ? "
after a few seconds , comes the reply , " by working , just like the rest of us . "
a poster depicts an ethic albanian , and the caption reads , " where do kosovers get their car radios ? "
the answer : " in a shop , just like the rest of us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why do the tamils go to restaurants ? " - " to eat like the rest of us . "
two other posters address the stereotypes of thai women as prostitutes -lrb- " what do the thai do after dark ? " -rrb- and the flower-selling tamils -lrb- " why do the tamils go to restaurants " -rrb- . but the campaign has rubbed some people the wrong way , even though they might agree with its general intent .
" my first reaction was , oh my god , i ca n't believe they 've done this , " steve frost , a swiss government worker told deutsche welle .
" these pictures are just the worst form of stereotype , and the way these slogans are presented , people might not interpret them the right way . " ronald bernheim , the foundation 's president , knows that his critics think the cartoonish , stereotypical images are unsettling .
but they exist , according to bernheim , and they need to be challenged . " i 'm not comfortable with it , and i hope no one else is , " says bernheim .
" i want to question it and i want people to talk about it . " call it a kind of aversion shock therapy .
by confronting the swiss with extreme depictions of their own stereotypes - so extreme that many look away in discomfort - the swiss foundation against racism and anti-semitism is hoping to prompt swiss citizens to reconsider these stereotypes .
will this be enough to diminish support for the svp ?

after the king fahd academy in bonn , germany , came under investigation for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda , the regional commissioner has threatened to shut down the saudi arabian sponsored school . after a documentary aired on german public television a week ago , interest in the activities at the arab-language king fahd academy in bonn was heightened .
according to the show " panorama , " the school had come under investigation for allegedly harboring ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and other fundamental muslim groups believed to operate in germany .
in addition , german security agencies had been reporting a significant influx of radical islamists to the bad godesberg neighborhood in the former german capital where the school is located .
the king fahd academy , which is financed by the saudi king fahd and offers pupils a diploma modeled on the saudi arabian school curriculum , was established in 1994 in order to provide islam-based instruction to children , whose parents were in germany only for a short time , such as diplomats .
since its official opening in 1995 , the private school has increased enrollment to some 600 pupils , 195 of whom have german citizenship .
school authorities are now alarmed .
what initially started out as a recognized alternative for temporary residents in bonn has now turned into a regular institution for parents who want their children brought up in a strictly muslim environment .
with only one hour of german per week compared to six hours of arabic and eight hours of religious instruction , the school does little to integrate the children into their german surroundings , where statistics show the majority of them will later reside after graduation .
both educators and security forces are worried that the school is a breeding ground for islamic fundamentalism and anti-democratic principles .
according to the newsmagazine der spiege l , which quotes sources from within the interior ministry , the academy has attracted islamists from across germany to bonn .
the magazine reports that several fundamentalists well-known to security authorities , have sent their children to the school and to its affiliated mosque .
among them are mamoud a , former head of the islamist group frequented by christian ganczarski , the suspected accomplice of the djerba bomber , and the egyptian sayed m. , suspected member in the al tawhid group with connections to al qaeda .
the spiegel also reports that investigators have found traces linking the imprisoned al qaeda financier mamduh salim to the school .
in addition , the magazine says that the imam at the affiliated mosque has reportedly called upon teachers at the academy to prepare pupils for the " holy war . "
no tolerance for intolerance as a result of such reports and findings by security investigations , the regional commissioner for the state of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen roters , has called for the closure of the school and the removal of its right to educate .
" my goal is to shut the school , but we must do it according to the law , " he told the spiegel .
state premier peer steinbrück endorsed the decision , saying whoever fights against the principles of freedom should not be allowed to educate children .
" we will not tolerate intolerance , " the state leader was quoted in the same magazine report on saturday .
the subject of the school ’ s possible ties to al qaeda and its fundamentalist teachings have reverberated through the country , up to the highest levels of government .
last week chancellor gerhard schröder discussed the issue with the saudi arabian government while there on state visit .
state-sponsored discrimination parents of children attending the school have organized themselves against what they consider state-sponsored discrimination against the large arab-speaking minority in bonn .
they have contracted a lawyer to speak up for their rights and to force the retraction of reports such as the " panorama " documentary , which they say casts the school and its muslim focus in a negative light .
the politician jamal karsli of the fakt-party -lrb- freedom , work , culture and transparence -rrb- has also taken up their cause and criticized the government for discriminating against german-arabs in bonn , which according to recent statistics is the largest foreign community in the city with 15 percent .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .

blue blood isn ’ t the ticket to fulfilling every desire , as dutch prince johan friso learned the hard way .
after parliament rejected his choice of bride , the noble was forced to choose between love and the throne . just because he ’ s a prince , doesn ’ t automatically mean that johan friso gets everything he wants .
and what he wants most these days is the right to marry his beloved fiancée mabel wisse smit .
but the dutch parliament , which according to law needs to approve the royal match , is not inclined to grant the prince his wish .
on friday , prime minister jan peter balkenende issued a statement saying he would not ask parliament to endorse the prince ’ s marriage proposal despite written recommendations from the united nations and european union diplomats who have worked with the 35 year-old wisse smit and respect her work as a human rights activist .
thus , the love-struck prince was forced to choose between the throne and love .
for the 35 year-old prince the decision was easy ; after all he ’ s only second-in-line to the crown following his older brother prince willem alexander .
and so prince johan friso announced on friday that he would give up his right to succession in order to marry the woman of his dreams , just as any normal citizen in the netherlands has the right to do .
gangster bride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prince johan friso 's fiancée mabel wisse smit , on june 30 , 2003 , the day of the engagement announcement .
why didn ’ t parliament approve of the prince ’ s choice , certainly wisse smit ’ s resume was befitting of a princess ?
but the degree in economics and politics and the years as director of the open society institute in brussels , an organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights , weren ’ t enough to cover up a blemish in the fiancée ’ s past and guarantee parliamentary approval .
mabel wisse smit , it turns out , had an affair with a notorious gangster more than a decade ago while she was still in college .
and this fact has come back to haunt her .
only a week after her engagement to prince johan friso hit the media in june , rumors started going around that the future bride had a dark past .
when she was pressed about her relationship to klaas bruinsma , a drug dealer who was killed in a gang fight in 199 , wisse smit denied all contacts with the criminal .
last week , one of bruinsma ’ s former body guards came forth saying the future princess and his old boss had been lovers .
wisse smit then retracted earlier statements and admitted to being an acquaintance of the mobster and even visiting him on his boat .
she apologized to the dutch people for not being honest up front , but it was too late for parliament .
balkenende had already made his decision .
in an open letter , the prime minister regretted he could not approve of her marriage to the prince and said that " trust had been violated . "
" mabelgate " what ’ s now being dubbed " mabelgate " is just the latest in a string of controversies to rock the royal house of orange under queen beatrix .
although not quite the sensation of their british counterparts , the dutch royalty has been the subject on tabloids when it comes to love and marriage . # b # most recently was the mini-crisis set off by the heir to the throne prince willem alexander in 2001 when he announced his engagement to an argentinean whose father had served in the military junta .
the subject stirred so much discussion and ill feelings that the dutch parliament even conducted an open debate on whether or not prince willem and maxima could marry .
they did and now the two are happily married and maxima is expecting a child .
even queen beatrix ’ s choice of partner was hotly debated in the netherlands .
when it was announced that she would marry german-born claus von amsberg , a former diplomat , the nation was shocked .
back in 1966 , german occupation during world war ii was still very much alive in people ’ s memories .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .

germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .

it will take many more years before afghanistan is self-sufficient , says president hamid karsai .
but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road . two years after the u.s. bombing raid on afghanistan and the toppling of the taliban regime , afghanistan still has a long way to go before it can stand on its own feet without relying on international aid .
president hamid karsai sees the future with optimism , but admits it will be a hard road to self-sufficiency .
in the meantime the war-torn country is dependent on support from humanitarian aid organizations , governmental reconstruction teams , and the continuing presence of international peacekeeping troops .
although streets are being cleared , the infrastructure is getting rebuilt and a constitution and free elections are underway , karsai admits to his country ’ s reliance on outside help to achieve such goals .
without such help , especially the expansion of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- beyond the capital kabul , much of afghanistan would fall back into chaos and civil war , karsai told the german public radio station ard in kabul .
" i would like to see the isaf in regions of the country where security is not a given for the normal afghan population .
whether because of terrorist activities or instability through factious fighting , we need the expansion of the isaf , " karsai says .
and for this reason he " welcomes the decision by nato to expand the troops ’ presence . "
the afghan people will support it , he says .
cautious expansion of security forces after nato on oct .
7 approved stationing isaf soldiers outside of the safe confines of kabul , the decision needs to go before the un security council and be approved by each of the national parliaments participating in the international peacekeeping force .
the first area of focus for the new mandate will then be kunduz , the most important city in the north east .
germany has already announced its intent to send peacekeepers to the region .
between 230 and 450 bundeswehr soldiers are scheduled to be deployed in kunduz by the end of the year .
but many critics of the isaf expansion plan and aid organizations have voiced concern that sending peacekeepers to regions of relative security such as kunduz , does little in the way of maintaining peace in afghanistan ’ s largely unstable rural regions , where roaming bands of terrorists and local war lords resort to sheer force to implement their rule .
karsai is not open to such criticism .
he argues that the foreign security presence is needed everywhere and kunduz is a good start .
" kunduz is an important part of afghanistan .
from there , reconstruction teams can spread out into the provinces .
that ’ s why we support the german decision to star in the city , " he says .
" germany has always supported afghanistan and now they are contributing significantly to maintaining security and helping rebuild the country , " the president says .
continuing terror threat while karsai has pressed hard for the international community to expand the scope of isaf , terrorists have begun increasing their activities , especially those crossing the border from pakistan .
they pose the biggest threat to peace in the still fragile country .
" the rest of the world , the united states , germany , japan and the united nations must work with us to stop these terrorists .
there ’ s no other way .
they are a threat for us all , " says the concerned president .
but terrorists are just one of the problems afghanistan struggles with .
fighting among armed militias poses a considerable threat to security and are a danger to karsai ’ s central government .
just last week one of the bloodiest fights broke out between two generals in the north near masar-i-shariff .
both raschid dostum and atta mohammed support the official kabul government , but have battled for control of the northern provinces .
only through pressure from the central government was it possible to achieve a momentary cease fire .
" we will do everything we can , to stop such fights from breaking out – through the decision to call for a disarmament to the removal of weapons from the region and even to the demotion of officials , " karsai explains , despite knowing that such tough government tactics can lead to retaliation against his office .
but the president is intent on expanding his rule over the land , from kabul into the furthest province .

while her supporters in the reform movement were clearly delighted , hardliners who do n't share her liberal views were not pleased to see the outside world honouring someone they regard as a dissident .
there was little coverage of the award in the state media .
most of the official media are regarded as strongholds of the conservative hardliners .
shirin ebadi made her mark in the field of women 's rights here even before the 1979 islamic revolution , being appointed iran 's first woman judge .
pioneering role that distinction was removed after the revolution , and she took to teaching law at university .
but she soon went beyond that to become an activist pioneer of women 's and children 's rights , seeking changes particularly in the way the divorce and inheritance laws work in iran .
she also took up the cases of liberal and dissident figures who fell foul of the judiciary , one of the bastions of hardline power here . "
i hope the people who do not approve of her will now reconsider their position " female mp sharbanou amani two of her clients , liberal intellectuals daryoush and parvaneh forouhar , were stabbed to death in a series of killings in 1998 which turned out to be the work of " rogue elements " in the intelligence ministry .
shirin ebadi found herself in the dock in 2000 , accused of distributing the video-taped confession of a hardline hooligan who claimed that prominent conservative leaders were instigating physical attacks on pro-reform gatherings and figures .
that won her a suspended jail sentence and a professional ban , but it also brought increasing outside recognition from human rights groups abroad .
since then , she has continued her pioneering role , setting up a new non-governmental organisation , the centre for the defence of human rights .
award 's message fellow human rights campaigners , and the reform movement in general , were clearly delighted by the prestigious award , seeing it as validation of their own cause .
" i hope the people who do not approve of her will now reconsider their position , " sharbanou amani , one of 13 women mps in the iranian parliament , told the french news agency afp .
" it is a source of pride for iran 's intellectuals . "
elaheh koulaie , another female reformist mp , said the prize " shows the world community that the democracy process in iran is going forward . "
other reformists pointed to the huge discrepancy between the international recognition conferred on ms ebadi and the causes she is struggling for , and the dire situation she and her colleagues face at home .
in addition to feeling discomfited by the award , some conservatives saw it as a further attempt by outsiders to intervene in iranian politics .
the nobel committee said it hoped the prize would encourage those inside iran struggling for human rights and democracy .
" this prize carried the message that europe intends to put further pressure on human rights issues in iran as a political move to achieve its particular objectives , " said amir mohebian , a commentator at the hardline newspaper resalat .

but she soon went beyond that to become an activist pioneer of women 's and children 's rights , seeking changes particularly in the way the divorce and inheritance laws work in iran .

shirin ebadi found herself in the dock in 2000 , accused of distributing the video-taped confession of a hardline hooligan who claimed that prominent conservative leaders were instigating physical attacks on pro-reform gatherings and figures .
that won her a suspended jail sentence and a professional ban , but it also brought increasing outside recognition from human rights groups abroad .

" it is a source of pride for iran 's intellectuals . "
elaheh koulaie , another female reformist mp , said the prize " shows the world community that the democracy process in iran is going forward . "
other reformists pointed to the huge discrepancy between the international recognition conferred on ms ebadi and the causes she is struggling for , and the dire situation she and her colleagues face at home .
in addition to feeling discomfited by the award , some conservatives saw it as a further attempt by outsiders to intervene in iranian politics .
the nobel committee said it hoped the prize would encourage those inside iran struggling for human rights and democracy .
" this prize carried the message that europe intends to put further pressure on human rights issues in iran as a political move to achieve its particular objectives , " said amir mohebian , a commentator at the hardline newspaper resalat .

while her supporters in the reform movement were clearly delighted , hardliners who do n't share her liberal views were not pleased to see the outside world honouring someone they regard as a dissident .
ebadi has fought in the corner of high-profile iranian dissidents there was little coverage of the award in the state media .
most of the official media are regarded as strongholds of the conservative hardliners .
shirin ebadi made her mark in the field of women 's rights here even before the 1979 islamic revolution , being appointed iran 's first woman judge .
pioneering role that distinction was removed after the revolution , and she took to teaching law at university .
but she soon went beyond that to become an activist pioneer of women 's and children 's rights , seeking changes particularly in the way the divorce and inheritance laws work in iran .
she also took up the cases of liberal and dissident figures who fell foul of the judiciary , one of the bastions of hardline power here .
i hope the people who do not approve of her will now reconsider their position female mp sharbanou amani two of her clients , liberal intellectuals daryoush and parvaneh forouhar , were stabbed to death in a series of killings in 1998 which turned out to be the work of " rogue elements " in the intelligence ministry .
shirin ebadi found herself in the dock in 2000 , accused of distributing the video-taped confession of a hardline hooligan who claimed that prominent conservative leaders were instigating physical attacks on pro-reform gatherings and figures .
that won her a suspended jail sentence and a professional ban , but it also brought increasing outside recognition from human rights groups abroad .
since then , she has continued her pioneering role , setting up a new non-governmental organisation , the centre for the defence of human rights .
award 's message fellow human rights campaigners , and the reform movement in general , were clearly delighted by the prestigious award , seeing it as validation of their own cause .
" i hope the people who do not approve of her will now reconsider their position , " sharbanou amani , one of 13 women mps in the iranian parliament , told the french news agency afp .
" it is a source of pride for iran 's intellectuals . "
elaheh koulaie , another female reformist mp , said the prize " shows the world community that the democracy process in iran is going forward . "
other reformists pointed to the huge discrepancy between the international recognition conferred on ms ebadi and the causes she is struggling for , and the dire situation she and her colleagues face at home .
in addition to feeling discomfited by the award , some conservatives saw it as a further attempt by outsiders to intervene in iranian politics .
the nobel committee said it hoped the prize would encourage those inside iran struggling for human rights and democracy .
" this prize carried the message that europe intends to put further pressure on human rights issues in iran as a political move to achieve its particular objectives , " said amir mohebian , a commentator at the hardline newspaper resalat .
