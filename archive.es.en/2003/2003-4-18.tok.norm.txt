with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2003 german healthcare : cash-strapped and in need of reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive medicine following a € 3 billion cash shortfall last year , gerhard schröder is eager to bring new reforms to germany 's national healthcare system .
but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .
they fear that the public health system is going to remain a problem for some time to come .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2003 german healthcare : cash-strapped and in need of reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive medicine following a € 3 billion cash shortfall last year , gerhard schröder is eager to bring new reforms to germany 's national healthcare system .
but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .
they fear that the public health system is going to remain a problem for some time to come .
many point out the fact that the public health fund had a budget shortfall of € 3 billion in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup for its part , the social democratic party and its junior coalition partner in the federal government , the green party , is preparing a draft reform law based on the recently completed work of the rürup commission .
the 26-member panel , led by leading german economist bert rürup -lrb- photo -rrb- , was convened to help resuscitate the country 's entire social services system , which has been choking under the weight of massive deficits in many areas .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .

he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : expansion in focus image is everything for the eu adding ten more storeys to the eu ’ s tower of babel paying -lrb- a lot -rrb- for eu membership chirac ruffles eu feathers with tirade europe -pipe- 18.04.2003 opinion : the future of the euro zone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to an eastern european country near you ?
with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .
they fear that the public health system is going to remain a problem for some time to come .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.04.2003 pop music academy opens its doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fame ?
you can learn it now in mannheim yearning for your five minutes of fame ?
fancy studying pop music ?
the pop academy opens next week in baden-württemberg . germany 's first ever pop academy will open next tuesday in mannheim in the state of baden-württemburg in the hope of reversing the dire straits in the german pop music industry . more than 1,000 potential german britney spears and justin timberlakes have applied for the 55 spots on the two courses on offer at the pop academy , where classes will begin in october . for € 500 -lrb- $ 545 -rrb- per semester , potential musicians , managers and pop promoters can take a three-year degree course in pop music design and " music business , " which mix theory with practice .
alongside classroom-based lectures , students will have the opportunity to undertake internships in music firms . at the end of the course , students will receive the state-recognized qualification " bachelor of arts .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .
they fear that the public health system is going to remain a problem for some time to come .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .

fancy studying pop music ?
the pop academy opens next week in baden-württemberg . germany 's first ever pop academy will open next tuesday in mannheim in the state of baden-württemburg in the hope of reversing the dire straits in the german pop music industry . more than 1,000 potential german britney spears and justin timberlakes have applied for the 55 spots on the two courses on offer at the pop academy , where classes will begin in october . for € 500 -lrb- $ 545 -rrb- per semester , potential musicians , managers and pop promoters can take a three-year degree course in pop music design and " music business , " which mix theory with practice .
alongside classroom-based lectures , students will have the opportunity to undertake internships in music firms . at the end of the course , students will receive the state-recognized qualification " bachelor of arts . " a music industry in crisis with it 's penchant for middle of the road pop anthems and manufactured teenie pop bands copied from british and american formats , the german music industry has long been in crisis .
in 2002 alone , profits plummeted more than 11 percent . but the new academy - a state-funded offshoot of mannheim 's rock foundation , which was started in 1996 - is hoping to fix all that , not only giving its students music lessons but also schooling them in how to deal with record companies . still the academy does n't see its task as perpetuating the current rash of here-today-gone-tomorrow manufactured artists . " it 's really less about preparing plastic artists for their five minutes of fame , than giving people the know-how they need to be able to make the kind of music they want to , " academy spokesperson , isabel palmtag told dw-world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .
they fear that the public health system is going to remain a problem for some time to come .
many point out the fact that the public health fund had a budget shortfall of € 3 billion in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup for its part , the social democratic party and its junior coalition partner in the federal government , the green party , is preparing a draft reform law based on the recently completed work of the rürup commission .
the 26-member panel , led by leading german economist bert rürup -lrb- photo -rrb- , was convened to help resuscitate the country 's entire social services system , which has been choking under the weight of massive deficits in many areas .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .

additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system .

he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

you can learn it now in mannheim yearning for your five minutes of fame ?
fancy studying pop music ?
the pop academy opens next week in baden-württemberg . germany 's first ever pop academy will open next tuesday in mannheim in the state of baden-württemburg in the hope of reversing the dire straits in the german pop music industry . more than 1,000 potential german britney spears and justin timberlakes have applied for the 55 spots on the two courses on offer at the pop academy , where classes will begin in october . for € 500 -lrb- $ 545 -rrb- per semester , potential musicians , managers and pop promoters can take a three-year degree course in pop music design and " music business , " which mix theory with practice .
alongside classroom-based lectures , students will have the opportunity to undertake internships in music firms . at the end of the course , students will receive the state-recognized qualification " bachelor of arts . " a music industry in crisis with it 's penchant for middle of the road pop anthems and manufactured teenie pop bands copied from british and american formats , the german music industry has long been in crisis .
in 2002 alone , profits plummeted more than 11 percent . but the new academy - a state-funded offshoot of mannheim 's rock foundation , which was started in 1996 - is hoping to fix all that , not only giving its students music lessons but also schooling them in how to deal with record companies . still the academy does n't see its task as perpetuating the current rash of here-today-gone-tomorrow manufactured artists . " it 's really less about preparing plastic artists for their five minutes of fame , than giving people the know-how they need to be able to make the kind of music they want to , " academy spokesperson , isabel palmtag told dw-world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone . " a push to cut costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt federal health minister ulla schmidt is currently pushing to stem expenditures and costs in public health funds .
this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .

but previous governments have failed for 25 years to push through similar measures . germany 's previous healthcare system reform laws have had some pretty impressive names – the " new reorganization and solidarity law " or the " premium relief law , " for example .
but no measure has prevented costs and premium rates in the national health fund from skyrocketing . since 1977 , premium rates in germany have risen from about 11 percent of a person 's gross salary to , in some cases , more than 14 percent today .
in addition , patients these days are required to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for medication and hospital expenses not covered by their insurance .
in total , they are forced to pony up more than € 13 billion -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year for extras . " either we let these developments continue , in which case the only thing left will be reductions in healthcare services , or we ration medical care based on age , " german chancellor gerhard schröder recently warned , " or we can decide on reforms that will make our good health financially viable for everyone .

this year , for example , she ordered doctors to put a freeze on any increases in fees .
additionally , in order to reduce the system 's mountain of debt , schmidt also ordered doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names whenever possible and demanded bigger discounts from pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry for bulk purchases made with public health funds . the health minister has also placed the powerful medical lobbying industry in her sights . contracts determining pay for doctors and services in germany are currently negotiated with the government by the state-level krankenärtzlichen vereinigungen , the associations representing doctors in the public health system . " our health care policies have a clear concept : quality , transparency and prevention – not two-class medicine or resignation to all the lobbying groups who walk around outside foreswearing the end of the world , " schmidt recently said .
" for that reason , we 're going to stick with these reforms .
we want quality .
the reforms will come and will be the most important contribution to ensuring that health care is affordable for everyone . " sharing the pain schmidt is calling for everyone to participate in the health system reforms : doctors , hospitals , the pharmaceutical industry , pharmacies and patients .
with rising health system costs , non-wage labor costs , too , are expected to dramatically increase . for the most part , chancellor schröder has supported schmidt 's call for reforms .
he 's also campaigning for better quality , increased competition and more price-conscious conduct in the medical industry .
schröder has also stated that germans should expect increases in their health care premiums as well as a greater deductible for prescriptions .
the government may also seek other financing possibilities for the money paid to patients to reimburse them for lost workdays if they are sick for longer than six weeks . 25 years of failed reform initiatives this is far from the first time a german government has undertaken a serious reform effort – previous governments sought to achieve the same goal for 25 years .
they all failed , and year after year costs have continued to increase as medical industry lobbyists have derailed any effort to cut costs .
with total industry revenues of € 250 billion , that 's little surprise – everyone wants a piece of the pie .
but with an aging population , staggering unemployment and fewer people to pump money into the coffers of the social insurance system , many in the government say cuts are imperative . but experts as well as opposition politicians fear the current reforms wo n't be enough to turn the deeply indebted system around .
they fear that the public health system is going to remain a problem for some time to come .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

with 10 new members , the european union should push to expand adoption of the euro single currency , but only after the accession states meet its carefully defined convergence criteria . the ink on the treaty of accession signed in rome this week had hardly dried by the time new member states from central and southeastern europe began waxing fantastic about their aim to join the euro zone .
this is not only their right , but also one of the consequences of eu expansion . the european union plans to help these new countries join the euro , but it will adopt a cautious approach .
in other words , it wo n't happen automatically - and that 's good not only for the current members of the euro zone , but also for the countries aspiring to become a part of it .
here 's why : money lives on the trust that is placed in its stability .
but this trust must be earned .
the economic strength of a country is paramount , but emphasis on the principle of economic stability is even more so . building credibility in that sense , proclamation of the principle is n't enough : only when a stability-oriented economic and currency policy is practiced over a long period in a credible and successful manner can trust be built among domestic consumers and investors as well as international currency markets .
and , of course , neither the current members of the euro zone nor the guardians of stability at the european central bank have any interest in bringing countries with notoriously loose monetary policies into their circle . countries that want to take part in monetary union must maintain similar economic practices to those countries currently in the euro zone .
that does n't apply merely to the free market economy , but also to competition laws and the idea of private ownership as a pillar of public order .
in addition to basic democratic foundations , these are also basic tenets for acceptance into the political union . even more importantly , inside the euro zone , price developments , interest rates , public budget deficits and national debts can not drift away from each other - the same standards must be applied across the board .
without those standards , it would be impossible for the european central bank to apply unified monetary policies .
and without unified monetary policies , monetary union would n't function . meeting the convergence criteria for that reason , after their accession in may 2004 , the eu 's new members will have to prove on a case by case basis that they are qualified for currency union .
they have to successfully prove they have met the convergence criteria .
it 's a process that will be easier for some states - like the baltic republics - but could prove more difficult for the larger members , who are battling considerable budget deficits .
if hungary , poland and the czech republic were to engage in a crash course that , for example , would put caps on budget deficits and controls on price trends and limiting them to the measurements permitted in the stability pact that regulates euro zone monetary policy , they would , at least in the beginning , lose more than they would gain . still , the new eu member states wo n't -lrb- and should n't -rrb- lose sight of the possibility of introducing the euro .
for the goal of eu membership is n't just to stabilize the recently achieved democratic relationships , but also to gain access to the western european level of prosperity .
in that sense , the euro , like its predecessor , the deutsche mark , is an object of desire .
and just as earlier stability policies in germany ensured the success of the deutsche mark , today 's high standards for currency stability are also at the foundation of the successful euro . the new member states want the euro and they will get it , too - but perhaps not as quickly as some might expect .
but realistically , the euro zone can be best and most successfully expanded after these countries reach not only the convergence criteria laid out in the european stability pact , but also achieve an actual approximation of western european prosperity . deutsche welle editor karl zawadzky contributed this opinion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's full coverage of the historic expansion of the european union from 15 to 25 members with more than 450 million residents .

the pop academy opens next week in baden-württemberg . germany 's first ever pop academy will open next tuesday in mannheim in the state of baden-württemburg in the hope of reversing the dire straits in the german pop music industry . more than 1,000 potential german britney spears and justin timberlakes have applied for the 55 spots on the two courses on offer at the pop academy , where classes will begin in october . for € 500 -lrb- $ 545 -rrb- per semester , potential musicians , managers and pop promoters can take a three-year degree course in pop music design and " music business , " which mix theory with practice .
alongside classroom-based lectures , students will have the opportunity to undertake internships in music firms . at the end of the course , students will receive the state-recognized qualification " bachelor of arts . " a music industry in crisis with it 's penchant for middle of the road pop anthems and manufactured teenie pop bands copied from british and american formats , the german music industry has long been in crisis .
in 2002 alone , profits plummeted more than 11 percent . but the new academy - a state-funded offshoot of mannheim 's rock foundation , which was started in 1996 - is hoping to fix all that , not only giving its students music lessons but also schooling them in how to deal with record companies . still the academy does n't see its task as perpetuating the current rash of here-today-gone-tomorrow manufactured artists . " it 's really less about preparing plastic artists for their five minutes of fame , than giving people the know-how they need to be able to make the kind of music they want to , " academy spokesperson , isabel palmtag told dw-world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany finds its " superstar " the " german robbie williams " wins germany 's version of the ultra-successful british and us superstar competition , " pop idol .

" one hundred per cent , " he said .
as he 'd predicted the court dismissed his appeal against the sodomy conviction he received three years ago .
after the ruling anwar hit out at the malaysian government .
" what difference is there with mugabe ? " he asked , " what difference from saddam ? "
flawed trial anwar was arrested in september 1998 days after leaving the government of prime minister dr mahathir mohamad and leading protests against him .
his original trials were widely seen as flawed and politically motivated .
the us state department still lists him as a political prisoner and representatives from the us embassy were in court to observe the ruling .
i chatted with anwar after the ruling .
" why ? " he asked .
" the party is weak , the machinery is not there , " he said referring to the national justice party -lrb- keadilan -rrb- which he founded .
in doing so he had answered his own question .
his party is weak because its leader is in prison .
optimist even after four years in jail anwar has charisma and his release could still galvanise not just his own but other opposition parties .
malaysia is gearing up for the planned handover of power from dr mahathir to the man who replaced anwar as the prime minister 's deputy , abdullah badawi .
a general election is on the horizon .
a free anwar would provide the government with an unwanted challenge .
he now faces six more years in jail - if he is given the mandatory one third remission of his sentence for good behaviour .
i asked him how he was facing up to the sentence .
" i 'll be out before that , " he told me .
" i 'm an incorrigible optimist , " he said and smiled .

the proportion of children baptised in the church of scotland has slumped in the past 40 years .
new figures reveal that one in six -lrb- 17 % -rrb- of babies were being baptised in 2001 .
this compared to roughly half of all babies in 1961 , according to the report published ahead of next month 's church of scotland general assembly .
extended family the kirk 's panel on doctrine said the decline was partly explained by a trend towards baptism later in life as parents increasingly preferred to allow their children to decide for themselves .
at its general assembly next month , the kirk will discuss whether to introduce a blessing for new babies where neither of the parents belong to the faith .
the panel also said current regulations about whose children could be baptised should be reviewed to make them less restrictive .
current rules specify that at least one parent should be a member of the church .
but the panel said ways of bringing people into the church through their extended family ought to be considered .

the average price of a home in wales is now £ 70,000 , the royal institution of chartered surveyors ' housing market survey has recorded .
forty six per percent of surveyors questioned reported price rises , up from 17 % last month .

rcis director cathy mclean said that this decline could be because buyers were being priced out of the market .
" the average price of a house for first time buyers in wales is now over £ 70,000 , which can make it difficult for these buyers to get a foot on the property ladder , " she said .
" over the coming three months , surveyors in wales expect both prices and sales to rise , but at a slower rate than is normally expected for the time of year , " she added .
falling the report indicated that the house market was cooling off after its recent boom .
" across the uk as a whole , there are definite signs that the market is experiencing a slowdown , " said ms maclean .
" the south west , south east , london and east anglia have all experienced a fall in prices .
" however , unemployment and lending rates are low and , with the end of the war in iraq in sight , the market could well bounce back by the end of the year , " she added .

torbay mp adrian sanders welcomed an investigation by the department of environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- into dolphin deaths around the south west coast .
but he said further inquiries were needed into pair trawling .
this is claimed to be one of the fishing methods most responsible for cetacean deaths .
about 200 dolphins and porpoises have been found dead around the coast of devon and cornwall since january .
defra 's by-catch response strategy report looked into the death of these mammals in fishing nets , and accepted this does exist .
but mr sanders , like many other campaigners , said he was worried it had not looked into the problem deeply enough .
he believes more could have been done to enforce compulsory ' by-catch observers ' going onto boats .
voluntary acceptance instead , the report is relying on the voluntary acceptance by skippers of onboard ' by-catch observers ' , which critics say is not efficient or regular enough .
mr sanders said that , if no definite action was taken now , some species , like bottle-nosed dolphins , would disappear altogether .
the defra report made several key recommendations on how to reduce dolphin deaths .
these included a legal requirement for vessels to use " pingers " , a device which emits a noise under water to warn dolphins off .
