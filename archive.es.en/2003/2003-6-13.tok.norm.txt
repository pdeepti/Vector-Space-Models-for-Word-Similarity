german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .
liberalizing the agriculture sector has been a key aim for the doha round of trade talks , and failure to revamp the cap could scupper the whole process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to approve sweeping farming reforms the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann .

once the free democratic party 's star , the 57-year-old former deputy leader 's career took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2002 .
möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .
just hours before möllemann 's death on june 5 , the german bundestag revoked his parliamentary immunity , and state investigators searched his home and office .
they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .
a back-up parachute was not opened and he plunged to his death from a height of around 800 meters -lrb- 2,600 feet -rrb- . the local prosecutor said he is continuing to explore every possiblity .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .
liberalizing the agriculture sector has been a key aim for the doha round of trade talks , and failure to revamp the cap could scupper the whole process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to approve sweeping farming reforms the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann .

möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .

they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .
certainly until this matter is resolved we will have to oppose any further spending for construction for a new nato headquarters here in brussels . " belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .
" and i hope the readiness to carry responsibility for europe will also then grow .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .
liberalizing the agriculture sector has been a key aim for the doha round of trade talks , and failure to revamp the cap could scupper the whole process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to approve sweeping farming reforms the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .
certainly until this matter is resolved we will have to oppose any further spending for construction for a new nato headquarters here in brussels . " belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .
further u.s. funding for an expanded nato headquarters , however , would be withheld until something was done . " it is perfectly possible to meet elsewhere , " he said . other nato defense ministers , in belgium for the meeting , said the media should not overreact to rumsfeld 's comments . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato meets to revamp transatlantic alliance european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .
certainly until this matter is resolved we will have to oppose any further spending for construction for a new nato headquarters here in brussels . " belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .
further u.s. funding for an expanded nato headquarters , however , would be withheld until something was done . " it is perfectly possible to meet elsewhere , " he said . other nato defense ministers , in belgium for the meeting , said the media should not overreact to rumsfeld 's comments . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato meets to revamp transatlantic alliance european and american defense ministers will attempt to fashion a “ new ” nato on thursday and friday , as the transatlantic alliance tries to keep its relevance in the face of changing security threats .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann . " once a star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen möllemann in the colors of the fdp .
once the free democratic party 's star , the 57-year-old former deputy leader 's career took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2002 .
möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .
just hours before möllemann 's death on june 5 , the german bundestag revoked his parliamentary immunity , and state investigators searched his home and office .
they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .
a back-up parachute was not opened and he plunged to his death from a height of around 800 meters -lrb- 2,600 feet -rrb- . the local prosecutor said he is continuing to explore every possiblity .
those around möllemann before his death said that he did n't show any signs of depression . möllemann was the finance minister and deputy chancellor in former chancellor helmut kohl 's government until 1993 .
he was the father of three adult daughters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial politician dies in parachuting accident a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .
liberalizing the agriculture sector has been a key aim for the doha round of trade talks , and failure to revamp the cap could scupper the whole process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to approve sweeping farming reforms the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output .

germany , which has enjoyed friendly ties with afghanistan for over 100 years , has always been one of the main donor countries , particularly in the field of education .
a german secondary school has existed in kabul since 1920 .
several german academics have also taught at the university in kabul .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .
certainly until this matter is resolved we will have to oppose any further spending for construction for a new nato headquarters here in brussels . " belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .
" and i hope the readiness to carry responsibility for europe will also then grow .

under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .
liberalizing the agriculture sector has been a key aim for the doha round of trade talks , and failure to revamp the cap could scupper the whole process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to approve sweeping farming reforms the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .
certainly until this matter is resolved we will have to oppose any further spending for construction for a new nato headquarters here in brussels . " belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .
certainly until this matter is resolved we will have to oppose any further spending for construction for a new nato headquarters here in brussels . " belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .

as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .
" and i hope the readiness to carry responsibility for europe will also then grow .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann .

once the free democratic party 's star , the 57-year-old former deputy leader 's career took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2002 .
möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .
just hours before möllemann 's death on june 5 , the german bundestag revoked his parliamentary immunity , and state investigators searched his home and office .
they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .
a back-up parachute was not opened and he plunged to his death from a height of around 800 meters -lrb- 2,600 feet -rrb- . the local prosecutor said he is continuing to explore every possiblity .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann . " once a star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen möllemann in the colors of the fdp .
once the free democratic party 's star , the 57-year-old former deputy leader 's career took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2002 .
möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .
just hours before möllemann 's death on june 5 , the german bundestag revoked his parliamentary immunity , and state investigators searched his home and office .
they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .
a back-up parachute was not opened and he plunged to his death from a height of around 800 meters -lrb- 2,600 feet -rrb- . the local prosecutor said he is continuing to explore every possiblity .
those around möllemann before his death said that he did n't show any signs of depression . möllemann was the finance minister and deputy chancellor in former chancellor helmut kohl 's government until 1993 .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann . " once a star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen möllemann in the colors of the fdp .
once the free democratic party 's star , the 57-year-old former deputy leader 's career took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2002 .
möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .
just hours before möllemann 's death on june 5 , the german bundestag revoked his parliamentary immunity , and state investigators searched his home and office .
they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .
a back-up parachute was not opened and he plunged to his death from a height of around 800 meters -lrb- 2,600 feet -rrb- . the local prosecutor said he is continuing to explore every possiblity .
those around möllemann before his death said that he did n't show any signs of depression . möllemann was the finance minister and deputy chancellor in former chancellor helmut kohl 's government until 1993 .
he was the father of three adult daughters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial politician dies in parachuting accident a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann .

once the free democratic party 's star , the 57-year-old former deputy leader 's career took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2002 .
möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .
just hours before möllemann 's death on june 5 , the german bundestag revoked his parliamentary immunity , and state investigators searched his home and office .
they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .
a back-up parachute was not opened and he plunged to his death from a height of around 800 meters -lrb- 2,600 feet -rrb- . the local prosecutor said he is continuing to explore every possiblity .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .

the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .

" belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .
liberalizing the agriculture sector has been a key aim for the doha round of trade talks , and failure to revamp the cap could scupper the whole process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to approve sweeping farming reforms the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output .

eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2003 new software to unravel stasi puzzle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the orderly habits of communist bureaucrats have made it easier for new technology to uncover secrets they sought to destroy .
researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .
enter the geeks .
experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .
and if all goes well , the birthler authority and the ipk hope to have fitted all the pieces of their enormous puzzle back together - providing an archival treasure trove for historians and academics who want to research a difficult part of german history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the office for gdr documents - in german only fraunhofer institute - in german only radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .
" and i hope the readiness to carry responsibility for europe will also then grow .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would help france water down a radical reform of the european union ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
eu ministers will attempt to hammer out a deal next week . agriculture ministers from the 15 eu countries meeting in luxembourg on thursday failed to agree on a sweeping reform of the cap , which currently eats up roughly half of the union ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- budget . france , which has resisted decoupling farm aid from production subsidies , wants to buy time before making a radical and today received germany 's official support . " germany has decided to help politically , but at the same time france has also moved , " chancellor gerhard schröder told france 's europe 1 radio in an interview .
" we understand that france needs time to explain the changes to its farmers . " earlier this week , schröder and french president jacques chirac said they would back a " partial decoupling " of aid for farmers linked to production from 2006 onwards .
the european commission wants to end production subsidies from 2004 , before the agriculturally dependent economies of eastern europe join the eu .
critics fear that extending subsidies to the new eu countries will only exacerbate the already big problem of over-production in europe . the common agricultural policy has been attacked for years for creating unfair trade conditions and hurting agriculture in developing countries , as european farmers have been paid to produce food no one wants to buy .
but wary of the penchant of french farmers to stage massive protests , chirac defended the status quo on friday . " we will not agree to just any deal .
the cap is a good policy .
it is the trunk around which europe has grown and equally it is still an essential element of its identity , " chirac told a gathering of farmers , according to the reuters news agency .
" i will continue to defend the cap . " ministers to meet next tuesday on thursday , eu agriculture ministers were unable to agree upon cap reform proposals suggested by eu farm commissioner franz fischler .
but some ministers were confident a compromise could be found next week during new talks starting on tuesday . " all have realized that the time to make a decision has come , " said greek agricultural minister georgios drys at a press conference in luxembourg on friday , according to the german news agency dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast germany ’ s farm minister renate künast was also optimistic : " we are on the way to a huge reform . " since france is the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid and germany the eu ’ s largest paymaster , any franco-german deal will likely form the basis for cap reform next week . only last october , chirac managed to convince schröder to keep the eu agriculture budget steady from 2007 to 2013 , instead of sharply trimming farm aid as some european countries wished . cap reform is also seen as critical in getting the next round of world trade organization negotiations off the ground .
liberalizing the agriculture sector has been a key aim for the doha round of trade talks , and failure to revamp the cap could scupper the whole process . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to approve sweeping farming reforms the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output .

thousands came to mourn the death of former politician jürgen w. möllemann on friday .
but few of his former free democratic party colleagues were among them . six parachutists carried jürgen w. möllemann 's coffin to his grave in münster on friday , nine days after the former army parachutist died during a jump . as rumors continued to swirl as to whether the disgraced former politician 's death was a suicide , around 120 invited guests came to the ceremony , while 2,000 people gathered at his coffin before the funeral .
president johannes rau , the german government and bundestag president wolfgang thierse sent wreaths . members of the disgraced politician 's former party , germany 's liberal free democrats , were conspicuously absent but still reaped criticism for the way they dealt with their former colleague . " i want to make clear that jürgen möllemann did more for our community and the fdp than those who cast doubt on his personal integrity , " said the kiel fdp parliamentary group leader wolfgang kubicki while fighting back tears at the ceremony .
he thanked former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher for being the only top fdp politician to attend the funeral . möllemann 's widow had asked the fdp leadership not to come to the burial and ruled out a state funeral for the colorful but scandal-ridden politician .
the prospect had not appeared likely to begin with . gerhard rehberg , the head of the gelsenkirchen soccer club schalke 04 , on whose supervisory board möllemann had served since 1984 , said the politician 's death was " a serious warning that people should not be dealt with personally or politically as had been done with möllemann .

once the free democratic party 's star , the 57-year-old former deputy leader 's career took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2002 .
möllemann , who maintained close relations with officials in arab states , came under fire when he criticized israel and german jewish leaders in flyers distributed during the parliamentary election campaign in 2002 . the fdp held möllemann responsible for its poor election returns in september , and accusations of anti-semitism were followed by allegations in october that he had maintained party slush funds to the amount of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . in mid-march , möllemann resigned from the fdp - though he retained his parliamentary seat - and suggested he might start a new party .
but his credibility had already been hard hit .
just hours before möllemann 's death on june 5 , the german bundestag revoked his parliamentary immunity , and state investigators searched his home and office .
they suspected möllemann of fraud and tax evasion . police continue to investigate in every direction police have not yet been able to determine whether möllemann 's death was an accident or suicide , the theory held by many in germany .
witnesses reported that möllemann 's parachute cut away from his body after he opened it .
a back-up parachute was not opened and he plunged to his death from a height of around 800 meters -lrb- 2,600 feet -rrb- . the local prosecutor said he is continuing to explore every possiblity .

but tough work remains ahead .
though a number of contested issues must still be hammered out in july , valéry giscard d 'estaing says his convention has approved a blueprint of a constitution to hand over to eu leaders in greece next friday . sipping champagne to the tune of beethoven 's " ode to joy , " delegates at the european convention completed the bulk of their 16-month labor of love on friday by approving the draft of europe 's first constitution .
eu officials are already toasting the constitution , saying it will bring greater transparency and democracy to brussels 's often byzantine institutions .
as bickering and backroom dealing broke out between the 105 delegates from eu member states , future members and the european parliament earlier this week , friday 's agreement seemed anything but certain .
but in the end , convention president valéry giscard d 'estaing produced a draft the delegates could agree upon .
" this result is imperfect , but it is more than could have been hoped , " giscard d 'estaing told delegates on friday .
" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .
" and i hope the readiness to carry responsibility for europe will also then grow .

" a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe " german foreign minister joschka fischer called the draft a " very , very large step forward for europe , " saying the constitution would make the union more transparent than any previous treaty .
" in the future , people will know what gets decided in brussels . "
he went on to describe the constitution as the most important treaty " since the foundation of the european economic community " in 1957 .
peter hain , who leads britain 's house of commons and served as a delegate at the convention , said : " the outcome is a good foundation for a modern , democratic europe better anchored to its nation states and more accountable to its citizens . "
even critics of the draft seemed prepared to bury the hatchet on friday .
" people have debated , argued and fought enough , " said elmar brok , a delegate from germany who represents the christian democrats in the european parliament .
" you have to be able to recognize when a fight has come to an end .
and this is one of those moments - the fight is behind us and now we have to establish what it is we 've agreed to , " he said .
citizens referendums delegates managed to push through a handful of changes in the 11th hour , but the version approved friday largely reflects giscard d 'estaing 's most-recent draft .
among the significant modifications are the addition of a quasi referendum function .
under the new proposal , if at least one million eu citizens petition an issue , the european commission would be forced to take it up in brussels .
the commission , however , would not be required to legally support or pass legislation mandating the initiative - it would only give it consideration .
" i challenge the citizens of europe to show the courage to get massively and considerably involved in european politics , " said sylvia-yvonne kaufmann , a member of the european parliament from germany 's party of social democracy .
" that way we can get a step closer to what could then be described as a ' european public . " '
as expected , the draft also calls for the creation of the office of an eu president - who would be voted in for a two-and-a-half year term by the heads of state and leaders of eu member states by a qualified majority - and a foreign minister . debate continues over how to weigh votes it also retains the complicated deal worked out in the treaty of nice that would allow most decisions in the eu to be made by a double-majority vote representing the majority of eu countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population .
but giscard d 'estaing agreed to rehash the language of this controversial third part of the draft at a subsequent meeting of the convention between july 9-11 .
a handful of countries , led by britain , are seeking to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
at next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , giscard d 'estaing is to present his draft constitution to the leaders of the eu 's current member states .
but a government conference - normally responsible for refining all european treaties - that will ultimately determine the final language of a constitution is not slated to begin until mid-october and could continue into 2004 .
delegates at the conference will use giscard d 'estaing 's draft as a basis for drawing the final constitution .
in other words , though the draft will bring prestige to the greek presidency of the eu , the real work will start after italy becomes the rotating six-month figurehead in july .
and italy is already stepping forward to take command .
" the spirit of this convention must inspire the work of the government conference that will be lead by italy , " said gianfranco fini , a european convention delegate representing the mediterranean country .
" and i hope the readiness to carry responsibility for europe will also then grow .

researchers at berlin 's prestigious frauenhofer institute are programming software that will piece together documents destroyed by east german secret police workers as the sun set on the communist era . everyone knows that if you really want no-one to discover your secrets , the trick is to completely destroy all the evidence .
but this concept appears to have been lost on the workers at east germany 's secret police agency , the stasi , during the waning days of the communist country .
during the last days of east germany , workers at the agency 's magdeburg office , following the orders of stasi chief erich mielke , attempted to destroy the thousands of stasi files .
but instead of shredding the sensitive documents - which covered decades of the agency 's spying on east german citizens - as one might have expected , they very neatly and orderly ripped them into quarters and packed them into around 16,000 brown paper sacks .
painstakingly reconstructing history over the past eight years , teams of workers in state of bavaria have undertaken the painstaking task of reconstructing the papers by hand .
they ’ ve already reconstructed 300 sacks worth of documents .
but with over 15,700 left to go , it would take about 450 years to complete the job with their primitive methods .

experts at the berlin-based frauenhofer institute of production facilities and construction technology -lrb- ipk -rrb- are now developing new software which will make the process of reconstructing the important historical documents far easier .
computer-aided jigsaw puzzle according to reports , the software works rather like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle .
after the scraps of the documents - which vary in sensitivity from spy 's accounts of the activities of western leaders to normal everyday lives of gdr citizens - are scanned into the computer , the program searches other scanned remnants to find and fit together matching pieces .
the ipk had been given the task of developing the software by the federal government 's birthler authority , the agency charged with maintaining the vast stasi archive , which is a constant source of controversy for a recently reunified country still licking its wounds after more than 40 years of the cold war . though ipk has been banned by the government from speaking publicly about the classified project , it did announce this week that it plans to have a new , refined version of the program completed by this autumn .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .

" belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .
further u.s. funding for an expanded nato headquarters , however , would be withheld until something was done .

outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done . u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld stunned his belgian hosts on thursday when he suggested nato headquarters could be moved elsewhere in light of a belgian war crimes law . rumsfeld , in brussels for a meeting at nato headquarters , said the law , which allows belgian courts to try foreigners for alleged war crimes not matter where they occurred , provides a " platform for divisive politicized lawsuits against her nato allies . " it should n't take a genius to understand it 's a problem , " the outspoken u.s. defense secretary told reporters .
" it would obviously not be easy for u.s. officials or potentially coalition officials , civilian or military , to come to belgium for meetings .
certainly until this matter is resolved we will have to oppose any further spending for construction for a new nato headquarters here in brussels . " belgium : we already changed the law u.s. general tommy franks , who lead the successful u.s. military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq , became the latest target of the law after a group of 19 baghdad residents filed a war crimes lawsuit against him a few weeks ago .
the suit has since been referred to the u.s. by belgian authorities eager to ease an already strained transatlantic relationship . belgium 's foreingn minister , louis michel , said his country had already taken steps to change the law .
the legislature passed an amendment last year that gave prosecutors greater discretion to throw out lawsuits . " i want to say , once again , to mr. rusmfeld , that belgium has already changed the war crimes law , " michel said .
" we changed it , in order to mitigate the concerns of our american friends . " in addition to franks , rumsfeld listed other u.s. officials , including u.s. secretary of state colin powell , gulf war commander general norman schwarzkopf and former u.s. president george bush sr. who have been targets of the lawsuit . he said it was up to belgium , a " sovereign state , " to decide what to do about the law .
further u.s. funding for an expanded nato headquarters , however , would be withheld until something was done .

proposals are going through parliament this week to enable local councils to force water companies to add fluoride to domestic water supplies .
the british dental association claim that adding fluoride is one of the most effective ways of strengthening children 's teeth and cutting decay .
opponents however say the substance is dangerous to health and the benefits to teeth are not proven .
breakfast is testing the ' water ' on both sides of the debate with two special reports today we looked at the argument in favour of fluoride with professor liz kay who is a professor of dental health services - you can see that report by clicking on the link below click here to see our discussion tomorrow we will be hearing from jane jones from the national pure water association .
we want to hear from you , should water companies be forced to add fluoride to water ?
click here to e-mail us with your views liz kay professor kay says at the moment it 's up to water companies to decide if fluoride is added to the water supply .
fluoride facts only large doses of fluoride are harmful one part per million can be enough to prevent decay in teeth about 49 million people worldwide drink water with fluoride added fluoride can also be found in beer , tea and fish the british dental association want communities to be able to decide collectively that they want the water company to add fluoride , but this would need a change in the law .
hundreds of studies have shown that fluoride helps protect teeth according to professor kay ; in america it is very common for communities to ask for fluoride in their water .
she says that severe problems with children 's teeth can result in them having to be surgically removed because of the pain caused .
if this was compared with any other disease then there would be a public outcry for something to be done about it .
campaigners want a very small proportion of fluoride added to water - about one part per million and at that level wo n't have any ill effects .
professor kay is concerned that those who are opposed to adding fluoride to water are using scare tactics to by saying it causes ' terrible diseases . '

the history of the awards the red house website says : " in 1980 author and librarian pat thomson had a revolutionary idea - start a book award that actually involved children in the judging process .
" at the time mrs.thomson was on the executive of the federation of children 's book groups , a small charity devoted to bringing children and books together .
" other awards were given on behalf of librarians or publishers , but no other major children 's award in 1980 involved children as judges even in a ' shadowing ' capacity . "
a network of schools and families who tested the books was developed , using a simple review form .

the bank cut interest rates from 13.5 % to 12 % - the first rate reduction in 21 months .
reserve bank governor tito mboweni said the bank would remain ' vigilant ' on inflation risks and increase the frequency of monetary policy meetings .
" in taking this decision , the -lrb- monetary policy -rrb- committee recognises the progress achieved so far in reducing inflation , " said mr mboweni .
" but the committee will remain vigilant to the risks , particularly those relating to wage settlements , administered prices and the uncertain outlook for the global economy . "
more cuts ahead ?
economists welcomed the rate cut , which they said would help boost the flagging economy .
" i think it was quite a gutsy move , " said colen garrow , an economist at brait merchant bank .
mr garrow also predicted further cuts ahead .
" all in all i think we will see -lrb- a cut of -rrb- four and a half percentage points this year . "
meeting targets south africa 's key retail inflation figure , the cpix , rose 8.3 % on an annual basis in april from 9.3 % in march .
but it is still well outside the target range of between 3 % and 6 % .
mr mboweni listed a number of reasons why inflation would continue to subside in coming months - including low global inflation , the rand 's recovery and a surplus manufacturing capacity .
he added that the bank would now meet every two months instead of the previous three monthly meetings .
economists praised the decision .
" the increase in the frequency of the mpc meetings ... will undoubtedly add to the flexibility of monetary policy , " said matthys strauss , chief strategist at absa .

gary mills and tony poole have protested their innocence since they were jailed in 1990 for the fatal stabbing of hensley wiltshire during a fight at a flat in conduit street in the city .
both men have now served the minimum 10-year tariff set under their life sentences , but have refused the chance to be released on licence until their cases have been re-examined by the courts .
at their trial , mills , now 43 , maintained he acted in self-defence after being attacked by mr wiltshire .
poole , now 41 , said he took no part in the fight .
the pair will appear at the court of appeal next week gary mills told bbc points west : " one of the saddest things about this case is that the authorities have known from the first day - from the first minute - that neither of us was guilty . "
tony pole added : " i 'd like to say that it 's a good day for british justice and it 's nice to be out , but we 've got so much to do now .
" we 've got to rebuild our lives and where do we start ? "
an initial challenge to their convictions was rejected by the court of appeal in 1996 and that was followed by a defeat in the house of lords .
but in a high court hearing in december 2001 , the lord chief justice , lord woolf and mr justice ouseley , said they believed there were doubts about the safety of the convictions .
their case was referred back to the court of appeal in may last year by the criminal cases review commission -lrb- ccrc -rrb- , which investigates possible miscarriages of justice .
a spokesman for the court of appeal confirmed the pair had been released on wednesday evening .
they are due to appear back before the court next tuesday to hear the result of their appeal .

cbi scotland will say that all options should be reviewed - including privatisation if necessary .
the comments are being welcomed by the scottish conservatives , who argue firms are being placed at a " serious disadvantage " .
the cbi will say that businesses have become a soft touch for scottish water , with companies across the country facing increases of between 50 % and 300 % .
for example , the bp plant in grangemouth faces a water bill of £ 13m , while a comparable refinery south of the border will pay just £ 7m .
other options iain macmillan , of cbi scotland , said scottish companies and the public may now be paying the price for water remaining in public ownership .
during a lunch in edinburgh on friday he will call on the scottish executive to examine other options - including mutual ownership by customers or full privatisation .
scottish conservative enterprise spokesman murdo fraser said that such comments echoed what his party had been saying for some time . "
the scottish executive must take action now , as it has been horribly negligent thus far " murdo fraser tory enterprise spokesman he said : " scottish water - like any nationalised monopoly - is cumbersome and inefficient , and misallocates resources .
" it is no surprise , then , that i have had vast numbers of businesses complaining to me because their bills have increased by 200 , 300 and in some cases 500 % this year alone .
" it is simply untenable . "
he said water bills , combined with high business rates and " strangulating " red tape , put scottish firms at " a serious competitive disadvantage " .
" we are calling for scottish water to be mutualised , so that it is run by and in the interests of scottish customers and is better equipped to operate in a competitive environment which will drive down bills for domestic and business customers alike , " he added .
" the scottish executive must take action now , as it has been horribly negligent thus far . "
however , ministers replied that scottish water is only a year old and has already taken steps to make savings .

the cbi will say that businesses have become a soft touch for scottish water , with companies across the country facing increases of between 50 % and 300 % .
for example , the bp plant in grangemouth faces a water bill of £ 13m , while a comparable refinery south of the border will pay just £ 7m .
other options iain macmillan , of cbi scotland , said scottish companies and the public may now be paying the price for water remaining in public ownership .
during a lunch in edinburgh on friday he will call on the scottish executive to examine other options - including mutual ownership by customers or full privatisation .
scottish conservative enterprise spokesman murdo fraser said that such comments echoed what his party had been saying for some time .
the scottish executive must take action now , as it has been horribly negligent thus far murdo fraser tory enterprise spokesman he said : " scottish water - like any nationalised monopoly - is cumbersome and inefficient , and misallocates resources .
" it is no surprise , then , that i have had vast numbers of businesses complaining to me because their bills have increased by 200 , 300 and in some cases 500 % this year alone .
" it is simply untenable . "
he said water bills , combined with high business rates and " strangulating " red tape , put scottish firms at " a serious competitive disadvantage " .
" we are calling for scottish water to be mutualised , so that it is run by and in the interests of scottish customers and is better equipped to operate in a competitive environment which will drive down bills for domestic and business customers alike , " he added .
" the scottish executive must take action now , as it has been horribly negligent thus far . "
however , ministers replied that scottish water is only a year old and has already taken steps to make savings .

staff at a control centre can shout through microphones to let offenders know they have been seen .
the stops are fitted with cctv cameras that spin around on the sound of broken glass to capture vandals on video .
the aim of the innovative scheme is to reduce the amount of money spent on bus shelter repairs - currently running at about £ 300,000 a year in birmingham alone .
redvers hocken , a security consultant involved in the project , said the technology was quite simple .
" it 's an ordinary bus stop that 's had sensors fitted to it .
" the other day , for instance , someone was bouncing a baseball against it and the sensors detected that and they were identified . "
the bus stops are monitored in a cctv control room that is linked to west midlands police .
peter adams , a spokesman for centro , said a lot of money was being spent on repairs .
" on average it 's £ 300 per shelter .
we 've got a 1,000 shelters .
that 's a £ 300,000 a year bill which we 'd like to reduce if we can . "
peter ryans , a spokesman for birmingham city council , said : " it 's another addition to cctv and in some places where we 've already installed cctv we 've had an 80 % reduction in crime . "
it is hoped the hi-tech bus shelters could soon be a common sight across the west midlands .

" it 's an ordinary bus stop that 's had sensors fitted to it .
the speaker is fitted on the roof of the bus shelters " the other day , for instance , someone was bouncing a baseball against it and the sensors detected that and they were identified . "
the bus stops are monitored in a cctv control room that is linked to west midlands police .

we 've got a 1,000 shelters .
that 's a £ 300,000 a year bill which we 'd like to reduce if we can . "
peter ryans , a spokesman for birmingham city council , said : " it 's another addition to cctv and in some places where we 've already installed cctv we 've had an 80 % reduction in crime . "
it is hoped the hi-tech bus shelters could soon be a common sight across the west midlands .
