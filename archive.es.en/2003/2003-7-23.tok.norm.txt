jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .

critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts . "
part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .
he became a member of ig metall in 1961 .
his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .

in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .

" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts .

his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .
in 1988 , peters became the head of ig metall 's hanover district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel and jürgen peters a decade later in 1998 peters ran to become the union 's deputy chief , against the will of outgoing ig metall chairman klaus zwickel -lrb- photo , left -rrb- .
in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .

carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .
" still there 's no perfect place .
but germany could be pretty close . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign tech workers still wanted in germany germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .
" camps and factions should not be allowed at ig metall . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .

germany ’ s ambassador to the united nations , gunther pleuger , said that germany would support a new un resolution that would see a step-by-step removal of u.s. forces from iraq and an increased political role for the united nations within the country . u.s. president george w. bush responded to the call by saying that he would welcome more international support for helping increase security in iraq , but he doubted a new un resolution was necessary as a mandate for the support .
" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .

jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .
" camps and factions should not be allowed at ig metall . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .

critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts . "
part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .
he became a member of ig metall in 1961 .
his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .
in 1988 , peters became the head of ig metall 's hanover district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel and jürgen peters a decade later in 1998 peters ran to become the union 's deputy chief , against the will of outgoing ig metall chairman klaus zwickel -lrb- photo , left -rrb- .
in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .

critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts . "
part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .
he became a member of ig metall in 1961 .
his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .
in 1988 , peters became the head of ig metall 's hanover district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel and jürgen peters a decade later in 1998 peters ran to become the union 's deputy chief , against the will of outgoing ig metall chairman klaus zwickel -lrb- photo , left -rrb- .
in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters is expected to take the helm of ig metall in august .
critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts . "
part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .
he became a member of ig metall in 1961 .
his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .
in 1988 , peters became the head of ig metall 's hanover district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel and jürgen peters a decade later in 1998 peters ran to become the union 's deputy chief , against the will of outgoing ig metall chairman klaus zwickel -lrb- photo , left -rrb- .
in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .
unable to win the leadership battle with his heir apparent , zwickel resigned on tuesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform wing loses in union power struggle the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .

de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .

his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .

" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin .
de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .
" a more ambitious resolution may be necessary , " in order to define the un ’ s role more clearly , he said .
his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .
" france remains convinced that everyone would win if a true international partnership was put in place , and a global approach to the security , political and economic problems was overseen by the united nations . " speaking ahead of tuesday ’ s un session at a meeting of caspian sea states in moscow , russia ’ s foreign minister said , " we hope the security council will be able to establish constructively which urgent , additional measures are needed to consolidate the situation and start the process of reconstruction . "
ivanov added that russia believes that new security council resolutions are needed to give the international community the vital legal basis to take a more active role in the reconstruction process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger .
germany ’ s ambassador to the united nations , gunther pleuger , said that germany would support a new un resolution that would see a step-by-step removal of u.s. forces from iraq and an increased political role for the united nations within the country . u.s. president george w. bush responded to the call by saying that he would welcome more international support for helping increase security in iraq , but he doubted a new un resolution was necessary as a mandate for the support .
" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .
" we believe that the current resolution fully covers the actions being discussed , but that does not mean there could not be further activity in the security council , " a spokesperson for the government said .
" if there is a need for another resolution we would be very happy to consider it as and when is necessary .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters is expected to take the helm of ig metall in august .
critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts . "
part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .
he became a member of ig metall in 1961 .
his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .
in 1988 , peters became the head of ig metall 's hanover district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel and jürgen peters a decade later in 1998 peters ran to become the union 's deputy chief , against the will of outgoing ig metall chairman klaus zwickel -lrb- photo , left -rrb- .
in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .
unable to win the leadership battle with his heir apparent , zwickel resigned on tuesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform wing loses in union power struggle the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin .
de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .
" a more ambitious resolution may be necessary , " in order to define the un ’ s role more clearly , he said .
his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .
" france remains convinced that everyone would win if a true international partnership was put in place , and a global approach to the security , political and economic problems was overseen by the united nations . " speaking ahead of tuesday ’ s un session at a meeting of caspian sea states in moscow , russia ’ s foreign minister said , " we hope the security council will be able to establish constructively which urgent , additional measures are needed to consolidate the situation and start the process of reconstruction . "
ivanov added that russia believes that new security council resolutions are needed to give the international community the vital legal basis to take a more active role in the reconstruction process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger .
germany ’ s ambassador to the united nations , gunther pleuger , said that germany would support a new un resolution that would see a step-by-step removal of u.s. forces from iraq and an increased political role for the united nations within the country . u.s. president george w. bush responded to the call by saying that he would welcome more international support for helping increase security in iraq , but he doubted a new un resolution was necessary as a mandate for the support .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin .
de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .
" a more ambitious resolution may be necessary , " in order to define the un ’ s role more clearly , he said .
his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .
" france remains convinced that everyone would win if a true international partnership was put in place , and a global approach to the security , political and economic problems was overseen by the united nations . " speaking ahead of tuesday ’ s un session at a meeting of caspian sea states in moscow , russia ’ s foreign minister said , " we hope the security council will be able to establish constructively which urgent , additional measures are needed to consolidate the situation and start the process of reconstruction . "
ivanov added that russia believes that new security council resolutions are needed to give the international community the vital legal basis to take a more active role in the reconstruction process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger .
germany ’ s ambassador to the united nations , gunther pleuger , said that germany would support a new un resolution that would see a step-by-step removal of u.s. forces from iraq and an increased political role for the united nations within the country . u.s. president george w. bush responded to the call by saying that he would welcome more international support for helping increase security in iraq , but he doubted a new un resolution was necessary as a mandate for the support .
" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 german greencarders live life in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners recruited to boost the german it industry have to leave the country after five years .
the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .

von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .
" still there 's no perfect place .
but germany could be pretty close . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign tech workers still wanted in germany germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .

jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin .
de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .
" a more ambitious resolution may be necessary , " in order to define the un ’ s role more clearly , he said .
his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .
" france remains convinced that everyone would win if a true international partnership was put in place , and a global approach to the security , political and economic problems was overseen by the united nations . " speaking ahead of tuesday ’ s un session at a meeting of caspian sea states in moscow , russia ’ s foreign minister said , " we hope the security council will be able to establish constructively which urgent , additional measures are needed to consolidate the situation and start the process of reconstruction . "
ivanov added that russia believes that new security council resolutions are needed to give the international community the vital legal basis to take a more active role in the reconstruction process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger .
germany ’ s ambassador to the united nations , gunther pleuger , said that germany would support a new un resolution that would see a step-by-step removal of u.s. forces from iraq and an increased political role for the united nations within the country . u.s. president george w. bush responded to the call by saying that he would welcome more international support for helping increase security in iraq , but he doubted a new un resolution was necessary as a mandate for the support .
" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .
" we believe that the current resolution fully covers the actions being discussed , but that does not mean there could not be further activity in the security council , " a spokesperson for the government said .
" if there is a need for another resolution we would be very happy to consider it as and when is necessary .

the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin .
de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .
" a more ambitious resolution may be necessary , " in order to define the un ’ s role more clearly , he said .
his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .
" france remains convinced that everyone would win if a true international partnership was put in place , and a global approach to the security , political and economic problems was overseen by the united nations . " speaking ahead of tuesday ’ s un session at a meeting of caspian sea states in moscow , russia ’ s foreign minister said , " we hope the security council will be able to establish constructively which urgent , additional measures are needed to consolidate the situation and start the process of reconstruction . "
ivanov added that russia believes that new security council resolutions are needed to give the international community the vital legal basis to take a more active role in the reconstruction process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger .
germany ’ s ambassador to the united nations , gunther pleuger , said that germany would support a new un resolution that would see a step-by-step removal of u.s. forces from iraq and an increased political role for the united nations within the country . u.s. president george w. bush responded to the call by saying that he would welcome more international support for helping increase security in iraq , but he doubted a new un resolution was necessary as a mandate for the support .
" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .
" we believe that the current resolution fully covers the actions being discussed , but that does not mean there could not be further activity in the security council , " a spokesperson for the government said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .
" still there 's no perfect place .
but germany could be pretty close . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign tech workers still wanted in germany germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance .

he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .
" still there 's no perfect place .
but germany could be pretty close . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign tech workers still wanted in germany germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters is expected to take the helm of ig metall in august .
critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts . "
part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .
he became a member of ig metall in 1961 .
his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .
in 1988 , peters became the head of ig metall 's hanover district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel and jürgen peters a decade later in 1998 peters ran to become the union 's deputy chief , against the will of outgoing ig metall chairman klaus zwickel -lrb- photo , left -rrb- .
in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .
unable to win the leadership battle with his heir apparent , zwickel resigned on tuesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform wing loses in union power struggle the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .

the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .

critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts .

part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .

jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .
" camps and factions should not be allowed at ig metall . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .

the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .

waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .

de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .

" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .
" we believe that the current resolution fully covers the actions being discussed , but that does not mean there could not be further activity in the security council , " a spokesperson for the government said .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .

de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters is expected to take the helm of ig metall in august .
critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .

peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .

critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .

jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .
" camps and factions should not be allowed at ig metall . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks .

a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 german greencarders live life in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners recruited to boost the german it industry have to leave the country after five years .
the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .
" still there 's no perfect place .
but germany could be pretty close . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign tech workers still wanted in germany germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin .
de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .
" a more ambitious resolution may be necessary , " in order to define the un ’ s role more clearly , he said .
his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .

jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .
" camps and factions should not be allowed at ig metall . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .

" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .

considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .

" this will be fought out later .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .

critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts . "
part of the union 's left-wing faction , he has consistently spoken out against neoliberal voices within ig metall .
peters has been one of the most outspoken critics of german chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 plan – a package of reforms that seeks to resuscitate the economy by , among other things , making it easier to hire and fire employees and reducing unemployment benefits . a slow rise to the top born in 1944 in the town of bolken in the state of schleswig-holstein , peters later became a trained machinist and at a company called hanomag in hanover .
he became a member of ig metall in 1961 .
his career as a machinist ended after he took a job inside the union .
he then studied at the akademie der arbeit -lrb- labor academy -rrb- in frankfurt , becoming a teacher at one of the union 's teaching centers while while working for its chairman .
slowly but surely he worked his way up the union ladder . in 1976 , he began working in ig metall 's düsseldorf office , where he experienced the devastating crisis in the steel industry in the rhine , ruhr and saarland regions from the front lines .
in 1988 , peters became the head of ig metall 's hanover district . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zwickel and jürgen peters a decade later in 1998 peters ran to become the union 's deputy chief , against the will of outgoing ig metall chairman klaus zwickel -lrb- photo , left -rrb- .
in that position , he assumed responsibility for ig metall 's collective bargaining .
throughout , zwickel has been very public about his distaste for peters and the fact that he preferred the more reform-oriented huber as his eventual successor . in recent weeks , zwickel blamed peters for the failed strike and repeatedly called for his resignation .

critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .
but supporters see in him a tough negotiator who can deliver results for workers , despite recent setbacks . for jürgen peters , becoming chairman of ig metall is a feather in the cap of a more than 30-year career at the metalworkers and engineers ' union . but the 59-year-old faces many challenges when he starts his four-year term in august .
peters and his future deputy , baden württemberg district leader berthold huber , will have to find unity within a deeply divided union and seek out a new direction for the 2.6 million member organization , which just suffered a stinging defeat over strikes in eastern germany - its worst in half a century . add to that the fact that the german labor movement is suffering from shrinking membership and waning political influence .
in western germany membership among workers fell from 29 percent in 1992 to 24 percent in 2003 .
the figures are worse for the eastern part of the country , where membership sank from 40 percent to 18 percent , partially owing to the large number of business failures there .
opinion polls also show that the public believes unions should play a less political role . with so many factors playing against ig metall , the jury is out on whether peters is the right man for the job . differing views detractors see in peters a deeply entrenched traditionalist .
they see a man so insistent on pushing through a 35-hour work week in eastern germany that he was willing to risk jobs and the future of his union by calling a strike during one of the worst economic and labor crises germany has faced in its postwar history . the strike outraged germans after car factories in the western part of the country - inluding those owned by volkswagen , daimlerchrysler and bmw - had to shut down because parts were n't being delivered from eastern plants , threatening profits in one of the country 's most important industrial sectors . many also questioned the wisdom of calling a strike at a time when the economy is expected by many economists to shrink and the jobless rate is hovering at over 10 percent .
even east germans criticized the strikes .
with a staggering eastern unemployment rate of 18 percent , most workers are just happy to have jobs . critics also see in him a man obssessed with collective bargaining agreements at a time when economic conditions require flexible solutions that are custom tailored to individual companies . a tough negotiator his admirers however consider him a persistent and goal-oriented leader who is a tough negotiator and someone who can deliver results .
" we want money , money and then some more money , " is one of the quotes most often attributed to peters . supporters are fond of pointing out the successful deal he negotiated at volkswagen in 1993 , when ig metall workers agreed to cut back to four days a week in order to prevent massive layoffs .
his decision showed he could be capable of negotiating innovative agreements .
later , he helped negotiate a wage agreement for the production of a new volkswagen car that linked wages with production goals and helped stop the company from moving more jobs abroad . he has also proven popular with the union 's core supporters with his folksy , working class slogans like " millions are stronger than millionaires " or his lashing criticisms of germany 's recent " neo-liberal thoughts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2003 peters expected to lead ig metall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters -lrb- left -rrb- and berthold huber hope their nominations to head ig metall will end the union 's worst crisis ever .
jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence . the executive board of germany 's ig metall on wednesday gave a thumbs up to the nominations of jürgen peters and berthold huber as the crisis-stricken engineering union 's next chairman and vice chairman .
but their selection is still contingent on a vote scheduled for an ig metall congress in august .
participants at the meeting told german public broadcaster ard that support for the two men was unanimous .
the move came one day after ig metall chairman klaus zwickel resigned from his post following a power struggle with peters .
ig metall 's board is seeking to stop a fight at the top that has threatened not only the future of the engineering union , but also the political influence of all unions in germany .
zwickel had originally planned to step down in october , but he chose to leave earlier after failing to derail the nomination of peters , who he blamed for a failed strike in june .
peters called a strike after employers refused to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany to bring it in line with labor standards in the western part of the country .
but in a country with a stagnant or even shrinking economy and high unemployment , the strike found little traction .
the crisis that followed was the worst in the union 's postwar history , bringing into question the future of collective bargaining agreements and the political power of unions in germany . as the power struggle dominated german headlines , it seemed unlikely that 59-year-old peters would be able to succeed zwickel at the helm , as ig metall 's board had proposed in april .
the traditionalist vs. the reformer ?
peters comes from the hardline traditionalist left wing of the union and has opposed a number of structural reforms sought by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the vice chairman designate , fifty-three-year old huber , who serves as the head of the union 's baden-württemberg chapter , is considered a reform-minded moderate .
" today 's decision by the executive is a partnership born of common sense but no love match , " huber said at a press conference in frankfurt .
huber said he regretted the power struggle that had cast a shadow over the union in recent weeks and that he hoped the " process of self-mutilation " had ended , before adding that he was optimistic he could steer ig metall back to " calmer waters . "
doubts persist others offered a more skeptical outlook .
" the power struggle has just been postponed , " university of bonn historian harald biermann said , according to reuters .
" this will be fought out later .
neither peters nor huber will move towards the other one . "
criticism also came from within the union 's own camp .
a delegation of ig metall members from frankfurt-based carmaker opel attended the meeting and presented a survey showing that opel workers wanted the union to select entirely new leadership .
" we do not agree with the new proposal , " said opel 's heinz fussmann , adding that those responsible for the strike debacle , including jürgen peters , should be held accountable .
in recent weeks , outgoing chairman zwickel sought to derail peters ' nomination , and instead threw his weight behind huber as candidate for the top spot .
amidst all the saber rattling , huber withdrew his candidacy for the chairman position .
then last week huber said he would be willing to lead the union together with peters if their areas of responsibility were clearly divided .
but the two face considerable challenges .
according to a report published wednesday by the german business magazine wirtschaftswoche , the union is quickly losing members .
ig metall lost 47,000 members during the first half of 2003 , up from 40,000 departures during all of 2002 .
add to that deficits of € 8.4 million -lrb- $ 9.6 million -rrb- in 2002 and € 6.6 million -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- in 2001 and the picture looks bleak .
considering that 95 percent of ig metall 's revenues are derived from member dues , the decline is particularly troublesome .
peters said on wednesday he would make it his mission to shift the tide at ig metall .
" the members at the factories do not want an ig metall ripped apart by feuds - not among the rank-and-file , in regions or at companies , nor among its leadership , " peters told reporters .
" camps and factions should not be allowed at ig metall . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de profile : jürgen peters 's slow rise to the top critics see in jürgen peters a hardliner who represents outmoded union thinking .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russia ’ s igor ivanov have both gone on record as saying that , in light of the unstable situation in iraq , the current resolution needs to be extended .
the ministers believe that a new resolution should allow other countries to help the united states keep order in increasingly troubled iraq and to give the un broader powers to provide legitimacy for political reconstruction and peacekeeping .
resolution 1483 , approved by the security council on may 22 , defines the un 's role in iraq as one limited to humanitarian aid and political advice only under the current u.s.-british management of the country .

de villepin said at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on monday that a new resolution should give the un overall responsibility in iraq .
" a more ambitious resolution may be necessary , " in order to define the un ’ s role more clearly , he said .
his words were reiterated by france ’ s un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere on tuesday at a meeting at the united nations headquarters in new york .

" the existing resolution empowers countries to make a proper decision to get involved in iraq , " said the president . british officials argued that no new resolution was needed .
" we believe that the current resolution fully covers the actions being discussed , but that does not mean there could not be further activity in the security council , " a spokesperson for the government said .

the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . " given the chance to stay here , it would be a tough call , " says diego carbonell .
the 32-year-old uruguayan came to germany two and a half years ago .
he has a wife , a german-born child and a job developing software in munich .
but he 's unable to make long-term decisions , and it 's not his fault .
carbonell is one of about 14,000 foreign workers with a german green card .
he was one of the first people to take advantage of the program the german government introduced in august 2000 to make up for the dearth of homegrown it specialists .
the green card enables him to live and work in germany for five years .
after that , though , he is obliged to leave the country .
now carbonell is halfway through his term and his future is uncertain .
" at my age , i ’ m starting to plan a family life .
but i can not make decisions .
i can not buy a house .
there 's no sense in buying a car because i will have to leave in two and a half years , " he told deutsche welle .
help online carbonell is not alone .
insecurity is one of the main problems green card holders face , according to detlef von hellfeld .
von hellfeld administers a web site that has become a forum for people in germany and abroad who are interested in the green card program .
he also offers tips and advice to green card holders and maintains a database of around 20,000 people interested in working in germany .
" it 's not easy for green card holders .
just opening a bank account , getting a travel card or a mobile phone contract is difficult , " von hellfeld explains .
carbonell says he was one of the lucky ones .
" in 2000 , the lack of an infrastructure -lsb- to help foreigners get settled -rsb- was made up for by the enthusiasm of the companies .
the firm that hired him helped him get settled , including finding an apartment and opening a bank account for him .
it relieved carbonell of many of the bureaucratic headaches foreigners are faced with when they move to germany .
still it took him months to complete all the necessary paperwork and do the rounds of all the necessary offices to establish himself as a german resident - from getting registered at the local police office to getting a telephone hooked up at home .
problems mount now carbonell is on his third job in germany .
the first company went bankrupt ; the second one shut down .
he can consider himself lucky to have found a job in economically-depressed germany , and he may be an exception when it comes to his fellow green card holders .
although the highly-skilled workers - who mainly come from eastern europe , india and north africa - obtained jobs when they arrived in germany , many have lost their workplaces since the it industry collapsed .
a recent survey suggested that seven percent of green card holders were unemployed .
von hellfeld says the foreign workers face an extra hurdle when looking for a new job .
" a company will not invest in someone who has a limited residence permit . "
back in march when he saw that the situation was unacceptable , von hellfeld started collecting signatures from green card holders calling on the german government to offer them permanent resident permits after their five years of working , living and paying taxes and social security contributions in their host country came to an end .
around 300 people have signed the petition so far - a number that von hellfeld admits is low .
" we have people coming from countries that are n't democracies .
and they 're afraid to sign their names .
they say , ' i agree with the content , but i 'm not sure i want to sign . '
i think there would be two or three times as many signatures otherwise .
i get a lot of positive feedback . "
waiting for new legislation von hellfeld explains that the new immigration law could have helped solve the problem .
if the law had been passed it would have allowed green card holders the opportunity to extend their stays in germany and eventually obtain permanent residency .
but the bundesrat , the second chamber of parliament that represents the german states , rejected the bill in june .
the legislation - which would have been the first such law in germany - was meant to regulate immigration and provide for measures to integrate foreigners into society .
now a parliamentary working group will have to hammer out a compromise that both the bundesrat and the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , will accept .
von hellfeld thinks the law will finally be passed at the end of the year and that it will still give green card holders the chance to stay longer in germany .
but if he collects enough signatures before then he will use the petition to put pressure on the government .
greencarders network meanwhile , through the online forum carbonell is organizing a meeting of " greencarders " in munich , which will take place on july 26 .
he says he hopes it will lay the foundations for a network of foreigners who work in germany .
but he stresses that his aims are not political .
" this country is giving us a chance .
and we have much to give , not only technical skills .
not forgetting that this is germany , we could give a little bit of nuance to the cultural diversity , to make this place more multicultural , " carbonell says .
for his own part , his attitude toward living in germany changes from day to day .
" there are some things i will never understand about the german mind , " carbonell admits .
" still there 's no perfect place .
but germany could be pretty close . " nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign tech workers still wanted in germany germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance .

the association for international cancer research -lrb- aicr -rrb- is funding annual research fellowships worth £ 6m over the next five years .
but it says more government funding is needed to stop too many scientists taking up jobs abroad .
the first recipient of a grant worth £ 850,000 is dr gareth inman who will carry out research on the behaviour of cancer cells at the beatson research institute in glasgow .
avoiding responsibilities american universities in particular offer leading young scientists like dr inman attractive wages to carry out their work in the us .

" my research is basically trying to stop cancer cells from growing and dividing .

' scandalous ' the chief executive of the aicr , derek napier , has accused the scottish executive of " avoiding its responsibilities " in providing more funding for the basics of medical research .
speaking to bbc radio scotland , mr napier said : " the fact that basic scientific research is being funded by the cancer charities is being put forward as a reason for the executive to put no money whatsoever into basic science .
" i find that a very strange attitude and indeed it borders on the scandalous to think that the government is prepared to avoid its responsibilities for funding on the basis that voluntary organisations are doing it for them . "
however the executive said it has invested £ 47m in scientific research over the last year , and points to scotland 's good record on research publications .
a new highly skilled migrants programme has also made it easier for doctors and scientists to work in scotland causing a reverse " brain drain " effect , particularly in third world countries where their skills are desperately needed .

the association for international cancer research -lrb- aicr -rrb- is funding annual research fellowships worth £ 6m over the next five years .
but it says more government funding is needed to stop too many scientists taking up jobs abroad .
the first recipient of a grant worth £ 850,000 is dr gareth inman who will carry out research on the behaviour of cancer cells at the beatson research institute in glasgow .
avoiding responsibilities american universities in particular offer leading young scientists like dr inman attractive wages to carry out their work in the us .
dr inman explained that in the uk , funding opportunities are " few and far between " .

" my research is basically trying to stop cancer cells from growing and dividing .
cancer is a disease of uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation , " he said .
a recent report by the fraser of allander institute expressed concern that scotland was losing more professionals that it was attracting .
' scandalous ' the chief executive of the aicr , derek napier , has accused the scottish executive of " avoiding its responsibilities " in providing more funding for the basics of medical research .
speaking to bbc radio scotland , mr napier said : " the fact that basic scientific research is being funded by the cancer charities is being put forward as a reason for the executive to put no money whatsoever into basic science .
" i find that a very strange attitude and indeed it borders on the scandalous to think that the government is prepared to avoid its responsibilities for funding on the basis that voluntary organisations are doing it for them . "
however the executive said it has invested £ 47m in scientific research over the last year , and points to scotland 's good record on research publications .
a new highly skilled migrants programme has also made it easier for doctors and scientists to work in scotland causing a reverse " brain drain " effect , particularly in third world countries where their skills are desperately needed .

on the bbc 's asylum day , joanne hughes returns to caia park .
the violent outbreak followed friction between a number of iraqis and longer-term residents of caia park in wrexham .
but police blamed a criminal element for taking advantage of the situation .
caia park is home to thousands some believe the fighting resulted from a lack of understanding and misinformation about the refugees living on the estate .
ugandan refugee davidii kakande , who still lives in caia park , believes local residents are jealous .
" the people from iraq had cars and i read in the newspaper that some of the refugees come here in their underwear and now they 're driving mercedes benz , " he said .
there 's a lot of misinformation and myths and fears of the unknown catherine green , wrexham council " this situation in caia park of rioting happened because people here , they do not listen to refugees , they do n't care about them so much .
" the estate is not a nice estate .
when i was still an asylum seeker i used to live near bellevue park and people there are lovely and so civil .
" people in caia park look at you as an enemy . "
despite numerous attempts to talk to the iraqi kurd refugees they have refused to come forward , choosing to put the disturbances behind them instead .
zahid noor from the welsh refugee council said they are no nearer to discovering why the disturbances occurred .
he added that the majority of refugees , moved from the estate to a safe house , have now left wrexham .
a total of 73 people were arrested following the two nights of violence which began on 22 june .
forty-eight people have been charged with violent disorder and , within that figure , four have been charged in addition with throwing petrol bombs .
police say they expect further large-scale arrests in the future once further evidence has been gathered .
caia park resident chris thomas said lessons had been learnt residents ' association member chris thomas said people needed to be educated about legal entitlements .
" there 's all this confusion .
you see programmes on television , there 's the asylum issue and the refugee issue and people are confused about the differences between the two , " she said .
" there is a long history of people from different ethnic backgrounds living on the estate and there 's never been a problem with that .
" the problem was that there was a large number of young , single males in a small area .
" had there been the same number of young males from any background there may have been problems because they have different lifestyles . "
catherine green , of wrexham council , said many people did not understand why people flee to the uk .
ugandan refugee davidii kakande said people look at you as an enemy " there 's a lot of misinformation and myths and fears of the unknown .
people do n't understand that the people who are granted refugee status have fled terrible happenings in their own countries , " she said .
rumours flying around the estate included claims that refugees had been given free mobile telephones and cars by the council .
" all of these refugees have jobs - like anyone who has a job they can spend their money anyway they want to , " said wrexham council 's deputy leader alun jenkins .
" they can buy mobile phones but there 's this feeling that they 're here scrounging , that they 're being given money and mobile phones - that 's quite untrue , " he added .
the estate and its residents are now looking to the future .
tenants , the council , community groups and support networks for asylum seekers and refugees have set up two groups to look at the problems on the estate .
they are looking at housing and policy , education and community information .
" there are certain things you can do - understanding people 's cultures more , " said mrs thomas .
" in the local schools here they do talk about different cultures .
" maybe as a community we could celebrate different cultures . "
she added : " during the initial disturbances people were immediately saying it was race but now they say it was n't , but it 's too late .
" it 's really getting to me that because my address is caia park people are assuming i 'm a racist , " she said .
mrs thomas said the community should not offer shelter to asylum seekers or refugees until the problem was addressed .

at michael foot 's house in hampstead , my coffee was brought in a mug specially produced to celebrate the centenary six years ago of aneurin bevan .
well , of course it was .
tony blair invited michael foot to no 10 for his birthday the two men were bound together in politics and friendship both in life and remain so even today , more than 40 years after bevan 's death .
between them they represented the ebbw vale constituency -lrb- later blaenau gwent -rrb- at westminster for more than 60 years .
foot was bevan 's political disciple and successor , and his conversation is still constantly punctuated by references to him .

michael foot has spent 90 years on the left wing that is the unswerving loyalty he has always given to people and ideas that have won his support .

in 1910 , ingrid wilson 's grandmother lena made a frightening journey from the ukraine to british shores .
along with lena 's father jacob , lena and her 17-year-old brother harry had to be smuggled over because she had no birth certificate and he was of the age to be called up to the russian armed forces .
the jewish family , along with thousands of others , were fleeing persecution by russians .
mrs wilson , who has lived in newport , south wales , since 1972 , said learning about what her ancestors went through to escape persecution was an inspiration . "
asylum is not a new issue , it has been going on for generations " ingrid wilson " my grandmother could never talk about all the details of what happened to her during their escape .
" it was just too painful for her to talk about it .
" she died in 1974 and took the story with her .
" we will never know exactly what happened during that time .
" but what we have learned has been totally inspiring and has brought our family so much closer together .
" asylum is not a new issue - it has been going on for generations , " she said .
mrs wilson , who has friends who are asylum seekers , said her story gave hope to people whose lives were in turmoil .
" when they hear about my family , it gives them hope that one day their grandchildren will be safe like i am , " she said .
her mother molly lozeron , 84 , who now lives in cheltenham , gloucestershire , with her husband leslie , explained how her mother made her escape . "
they had to swim across a river to get over the border " molly lozeron " it was quite treacherous for them because they had to be smuggled out of the country , " she said .
" i know that they had to swim across a river to get over the border as part of their journey and finally made it over here .
" they were russian jews and when they got to london , the family was given money from the jewish board of guardians to start up a ladies ' tailoring business .
" it was quite ironic that the family actually lived in moscow road in london .
" since then the family has thrived and we have lived good lives , " she added .

speaking on the last day of an asian tour , mr blair spoke positively of mr tung 's decision to heed public opinion and defer the unpopular bill .
" what the hong kong authorities are going to do is go back and look at this whole issue again and i think that 's sensible , " he said .
the territory 's government has announced that it will re-open public consultations on the amended bill in september .
mr blair curtailed his visit to hong kong - which was due to end on thursday - because of an approaching typhoon .
i found the chinese leadership ... very much aware of the need to handle the situation sensitively tony blair the bbc 's correspondent in hong kong , francis markus , says that mr blair has been walking a delicate diplomatic tightrope over the security bill , which drew out half a million protesters on 1 july .
he has had to balance between speaking out on the controversial bill - as local pro-democracy campaigners have demanded - and risking damaging britain 's relationship with beijing .
' sensitive approach ' after talks with mr tung on wednesday , the uk prime minister said he was confident that both beijing and hong kong 's government were paying heed to local concern over the bill .
anti-subversion bill outlaws : reporting state " secrets " criticism of beijing authority access to " subversive " material threatens currently legal groups , such as falun gong q & a : anti-subversion bill " i think there is a sense certainly that i have that the authorities here are very much listening to what people say ... " he said .
" i -lsb- also -rsb- found the chinese leadership , when i was discussing hong kong with them , very much aware of the need to handle the situation sensitively and in accordance with the guarantees that have been given to the people here in hong kong . "
the hong kong government said on wednesday that a version of the controversial bill containing numerous amendments and concessions would be put to public consultation .
" we will call this a consultation document and we plan to release it in september , " acting permanent secretary for security timothy tong told the territory 's legislators .
beijing has been pressing hong kong to pass the law , as required by the mini-constitution - the basic law - set up when hong kong was handed back to china in 1997 .
however , it has said little about the protests .
mr blair ended his visit to hong kong with a speech to the british chamber of commerce .
he told business people that his recent meetings with the leaders of china , south korea and japan had convinced him of their determination to tackle terrorism .
countries around the world also need to work closely to protect the environment and boost trade , he said .

gary ayres , 43 , stabbed his former girlfriend to death in a frenzied attack in 1999 .
he has been declared fit to be released even though experts at the home office disagree , nottingham north mp graham allen says .
ayres used a bread knife to stab his victim , vicki older , the 31-year-old mother of his five-year-old daughter at her home in nottingham .
mental illness she was stabbed and hit with a pick-axe handle , suffering 19 wounds to her head , neck and upper body .
ayres was cleared of murder because the prosecution accepted that he was suffering from a mental illness .
the whole system really needs to be reviewed so that everyone can be reassured mp graham allen he eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
a jury had failed to agree on whether he was guilty of murder or manslaughter after a trial in nottingham .
ayers is still being held at a psychiatric hospital where he is regularly assessed by the mental health review tribunal .
the tribunal has decided he is fit for release , but mr allen is concerned about that decision .
" the whole system really needs to be reviewed so that everyone can be reassured that if someone is declared to be mentally fit that they will be back in the community and be of no threat to anyone , including the friends and family of the victim . "
he said the victim 's family have been told that a home office forensic psychiatrist thinks eyres is still too dangerous to be released .
vicki older 's mother is so frightened she has gone into hiding .
the review tribunal has told the bbc that patients who are released can be put under strict conditions , including controls under what medication they take and where they live .

one of the aims is to reduce the amount of intimidation victims are subjected to .
the pilot project in exeter involves a number of groups and is backed by research carried out by exeter university and the probation service .
it is hoped ways can be found to reduce the high levels of intimidation and threats faced by the alleged victims and this , in turn , could lead to more successful prosecutions . "
if you are in an abusive situation , you are not alone , you are not to blame " devon and cornwall police the project spoke to victims of domestic violence to find out why some withdraw charges as the court case approaches .
as part of the project , all police officers in exeter have received additional training .
it is hoped the results could be used across devon and possibly elsewhere in the country .
devon and cornwall police said the constabulary was pleased to be involved in a project that tackled something that happens to one out of every four women at least once in their lifetime .
the police said : " there is no excuse for this violent behaviour .
violence is against the law .
" anyone can suffer domestic violence .
it spans all social classes and colours .

it is hoped ways can be found to reduce the high levels of intimidation and threats faced by the alleged victims and this , in turn , could lead to more successful prosecutions .
if you are in an abusive situation , you are not alone , you are not to blame devon and cornwall police the project spoke to victims of domestic violence to find out why some withdraw charges as the court case approaches .
as part of the project , all police officers in exeter have received additional training .
it is hoped the results could be used across devon and possibly elsewhere in the country .
devon and cornwall police said the constabulary was pleased to be involved in a project that tackled something that happens to one out of every four women at least once in their lifetime .
the police said : " there is no excuse for this violent behaviour .
violence is against the law .
" anyone can suffer domestic violence .
it spans all social classes and colours .
" if you are in an abusive situation , you are not alone , you are not to blame and you can get help . "
