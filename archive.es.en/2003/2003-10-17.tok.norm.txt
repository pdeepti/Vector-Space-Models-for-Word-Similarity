but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback some critics believe the pope has pursued religious policies that are too conservative for the modern world - others say they do n't go far enough .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .
europeans want no part of frankenstein food more than three-quarters of german consumers are opposed to gm foods , surveys have shown .
this figure is also representative of public sentiment in most other european countries , including france , belgium , italy , spain and britain .
the royal society report has spurred fresh demands for the uk government to keep so-called " frankenstein " foods away from already skeptical british shoppers .
" for years , the gm corporations have been claiming that their crops would reduce weed killer use and benefit wildlife .
now we know how wrong they were .
-lsb- british prime minister -rsb- tony blair should close the door on gm for good , " environmental group greenpeace said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings , however , give london a fresh headache over the issue since the report did n't say whether gm crops should get the green light .
even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .
led by the united states , gm crops are now grown in more than 16 countries outside europe .
feeding the world with gm crops the biotech lobby group , agricultural biotechnology council -lrb- abc -rrb- , said the findings showed gm crops had a positive contribution to make .
" these results confirm what the industry has long argued .
the flexibility of gm crops allows them to be grown in a way that benefits the environment , " abc chairman paul rylott said .
the biotech industry group , the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops -lrb- scimac -rrb- added that the differences between the crops studied was governed above all by the crop type , herbicides and weed control practices involved , not by the use of genetic modification .
gm food important for development policies the debate on gm food is also reflected in development policies .
the world food summit has set the goal of cutting by half the number of the world 's chronically hungry and under-nourished people by 2015 .
yet progress has been slow in these efforts , the u.n. food and agriculture organization said in view of world food day on thursday .
this is where gm food enter the picture .
many supporters say precisely these types of crops can be adapted to grow and flourish in the often difficult environment of many developing nations .
the chairman of germany 's christian democrat parliamentary working group on consumer protection and nutrition , peter harry carstensen , said he welcomed all international efforts to ensure adequate supplies of food for the world .
" it should be obvious to those responsible that gene technology can be the decisive factor in coping with that challenge , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's path to reform labor market reforms spelled out revamping germany ’ s pension system a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms german government accelerates tax cuts to boost economy germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .
here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .

here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 bundestag to vote on controversial labor market reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the spotlight : schröder has staked his political future on the passage of his reform legislation .
friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .
twelve pages of last minute changes were the result . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform read deutsche welle 's full coverage of the german reform debate .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .
europeans want no part of frankenstein food more than three-quarters of german consumers are opposed to gm foods , surveys have shown .
this figure is also representative of public sentiment in most other european countries , including france , belgium , italy , spain and britain .
the royal society report has spurred fresh demands for the uk government to keep so-called " frankenstein " foods away from already skeptical british shoppers .
" for years , the gm corporations have been claiming that their crops would reduce weed killer use and benefit wildlife .
now we know how wrong they were .
-lsb- british prime minister -rsb- tony blair should close the door on gm for good , " environmental group greenpeace said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings , however , give london a fresh headache over the issue since the report did n't say whether gm crops should get the green light .
even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .
led by the united states , gm crops are now grown in more than 16 countries outside europe .
feeding the world with gm crops the biotech lobby group , agricultural biotechnology council -lrb- abc -rrb- , said the findings showed gm crops had a positive contribution to make .
" these results confirm what the industry has long argued .
the flexibility of gm crops allows them to be grown in a way that benefits the environment , " abc chairman paul rylott said .
the biotech industry group , the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops -lrb- scimac -rrb- added that the differences between the crops studied was governed above all by the crop type , herbicides and weed control practices involved , not by the use of genetic modification .
gm food important for development policies the debate on gm food is also reflected in development policies .
the world food summit has set the goal of cutting by half the number of the world 's chronically hungry and under-nourished people by 2015 .
yet progress has been slow in these efforts , the u.n. food and agriculture organization said in view of world food day on thursday .
this is where gm food enter the picture .
many supporters say precisely these types of crops can be adapted to grow and flourish in the often difficult environment of many developing nations .
the chairman of germany 's christian democrat parliamentary working group on consumer protection and nutrition , peter harry carstensen , said he welcomed all international efforts to ensure adequate supplies of food for the world .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .

even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback some critics believe the pope has pursued religious policies that are too conservative for the modern world - others say they do n't go far enough .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .
twelve pages of last minute changes were the result . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform read deutsche welle 's full coverage of the german reform debate .

after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .

in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "

the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "

members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .

schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .

in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback some critics believe the pope has pursued religious policies that are too conservative for the modern world - others say they do n't go far enough .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .

even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .

since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings , however , give london a fresh headache over the issue since the report did n't say whether gm crops should get the green light .
even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback some critics believe the pope has pursued religious policies that are too conservative for the modern world - others say they do n't go far enough .

here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's path to reform labor market reforms spelled out revamping germany ’ s pension system a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms german government accelerates tax cuts to boost economy germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .
here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 the road ahead for labor market reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for germany 's traditional labor laws , which are due for a major reform .
why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .
europeans want no part of frankenstein food more than three-quarters of german consumers are opposed to gm foods , surveys have shown .
this figure is also representative of public sentiment in most other european countries , including france , belgium , italy , spain and britain .
the royal society report has spurred fresh demands for the uk government to keep so-called " frankenstein " foods away from already skeptical british shoppers .
" for years , the gm corporations have been claiming that their crops would reduce weed killer use and benefit wildlife .
now we know how wrong they were .
-lsb- british prime minister -rsb- tony blair should close the door on gm for good , " environmental group greenpeace said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings , however , give london a fresh headache over the issue since the report did n't say whether gm crops should get the green light .
even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .
led by the united states , gm crops are now grown in more than 16 countries outside europe .
feeding the world with gm crops the biotech lobby group , agricultural biotechnology council -lrb- abc -rrb- , said the findings showed gm crops had a positive contribution to make .
" these results confirm what the industry has long argued .
the flexibility of gm crops allows them to be grown in a way that benefits the environment , " abc chairman paul rylott said .
the biotech industry group , the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops -lrb- scimac -rrb- added that the differences between the crops studied was governed above all by the crop type , herbicides and weed control practices involved , not by the use of genetic modification .
gm food important for development policies the debate on gm food is also reflected in development policies .
the world food summit has set the goal of cutting by half the number of the world 's chronically hungry and under-nourished people by 2015 .
yet progress has been slow in these efforts , the u.n. food and agriculture organization said in view of world food day on thursday .
this is where gm food enter the picture .
many supporters say precisely these types of crops can be adapted to grow and flourish in the often difficult environment of many developing nations .
the chairman of germany 's christian democrat parliamentary working group on consumer protection and nutrition , peter harry carstensen , said he welcomed all international efforts to ensure adequate supplies of food for the world .
" it should be obvious to those responsible that gene technology can be the decisive factor in coping with that challenge , " he said .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .
europeans want no part of frankenstein food more than three-quarters of german consumers are opposed to gm foods , surveys have shown .
this figure is also representative of public sentiment in most other european countries , including france , belgium , italy , spain and britain .
the royal society report has spurred fresh demands for the uk government to keep so-called " frankenstein " foods away from already skeptical british shoppers .
" for years , the gm corporations have been claiming that their crops would reduce weed killer use and benefit wildlife .
now we know how wrong they were .
-lsb- british prime minister -rsb- tony blair should close the door on gm for good , " environmental group greenpeace said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings , however , give london a fresh headache over the issue since the report did n't say whether gm crops should get the green light .
even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .
led by the united states , gm crops are now grown in more than 16 countries outside europe .
feeding the world with gm crops the biotech lobby group , agricultural biotechnology council -lrb- abc -rrb- , said the findings showed gm crops had a positive contribution to make .
" these results confirm what the industry has long argued .
the flexibility of gm crops allows them to be grown in a way that benefits the environment , " abc chairman paul rylott said .
the biotech industry group , the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops -lrb- scimac -rrb- added that the differences between the crops studied was governed above all by the crop type , herbicides and weed control practices involved , not by the use of genetic modification .
gm food important for development policies the debate on gm food is also reflected in development policies .
the world food summit has set the goal of cutting by half the number of the world 's chronically hungry and under-nourished people by 2015 .
yet progress has been slow in these efforts , the u.n. food and agriculture organization said in view of world food day on thursday .
this is where gm food enter the picture .
many supporters say precisely these types of crops can be adapted to grow and flourish in the often difficult environment of many developing nations .
the chairman of germany 's christian democrat parliamentary working group on consumer protection and nutrition , peter harry carstensen , said he welcomed all international efforts to ensure adequate supplies of food for the world .
" it should be obvious to those responsible that gene technology can be the decisive factor in coping with that challenge , " he said .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback some critics believe the pope has pursued religious policies that are too conservative for the modern world - others say they do n't go far enough .

meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 the road ahead for labor market reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for germany 's traditional labor laws , which are due for a major reform .
why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "

not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .
twelve pages of last minute changes were the result . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform read deutsche welle 's full coverage of the german reform debate .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .
europeans want no part of frankenstein food more than three-quarters of german consumers are opposed to gm foods , surveys have shown .
this figure is also representative of public sentiment in most other european countries , including france , belgium , italy , spain and britain .
the royal society report has spurred fresh demands for the uk government to keep so-called " frankenstein " foods away from already skeptical british shoppers .
" for years , the gm corporations have been claiming that their crops would reduce weed killer use and benefit wildlife .
now we know how wrong they were .
-lsb- british prime minister -rsb- tony blair should close the door on gm for good , " environmental group greenpeace said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings , however , give london a fresh headache over the issue since the report did n't say whether gm crops should get the green light .
even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .
led by the united states , gm crops are now grown in more than 16 countries outside europe .
feeding the world with gm crops the biotech lobby group , agricultural biotechnology council -lrb- abc -rrb- , said the findings showed gm crops had a positive contribution to make .
" these results confirm what the industry has long argued .
the flexibility of gm crops allows them to be grown in a way that benefits the environment , " abc chairman paul rylott said .
the biotech industry group , the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops -lrb- scimac -rrb- added that the differences between the crops studied was governed above all by the crop type , herbicides and weed control practices involved , not by the use of genetic modification .
gm food important for development policies the debate on gm food is also reflected in development policies .

this is where gm food enter the picture .
many supporters say precisely these types of crops can be adapted to grow and flourish in the often difficult environment of many developing nations .
the chairman of germany 's christian democrat parliamentary working group on consumer protection and nutrition , peter harry carstensen , said he welcomed all international efforts to ensure adequate supplies of food for the world .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .
twelve pages of last minute changes were the result . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform read deutsche welle 's full coverage of the german reform debate .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .

after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's path to reform labor market reforms spelled out revamping germany ’ s pension system a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms german government accelerates tax cuts to boost economy germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .
here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .

schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .

in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "

for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's path to reform labor market reforms spelled out revamping germany ’ s pension system a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms german government accelerates tax cuts to boost economy germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .
here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 bundestag to vote on controversial labor market reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the spotlight : schröder has staked his political future on the passage of his reform legislation .
friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .

here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops . british scientists on thursday published the results of the world 's largest-ever experiment into the environmental effects of genetically-modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops .
after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .
" each new application of gm crop technology must be looked at on a case-by-case basis , using a rational evidence-based approach , " firbank said .
the trial findings were laid out over eight lengthy scientific papers .
they will serve as a guideline for helping the uk government decide whether or not to allow farmers to grow gm crops commercially .
europeans want no part of frankenstein food more than three-quarters of german consumers are opposed to gm foods , surveys have shown .
this figure is also representative of public sentiment in most other european countries , including france , belgium , italy , spain and britain .
the royal society report has spurred fresh demands for the uk government to keep so-called " frankenstein " foods away from already skeptical british shoppers .
" for years , the gm corporations have been claiming that their crops would reduce weed killer use and benefit wildlife .
now we know how wrong they were .
-lsb- british prime minister -rsb- tony blair should close the door on gm for good , " environmental group greenpeace said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings , however , give london a fresh headache over the issue since the report did n't say whether gm crops should get the green light .
even though weed density and wildlife numbers tended to be lower than the conventional equivalent in fields of gm rapeseed and sugar beet , the results showed that in fields of herbicide-resistant gm maize , there were more weeds and insects than in fields sown with conventional plants .
ulrike brendel , gm technology expert at greenpeace , said european governments can not ignore the study results .
" here in europe , we still have the chance to keep this ghost contained , " she said .
there are no gm crops in the ground in the uk at present and no imminent plantings .
led by the united states , gm crops are now grown in more than 16 countries outside europe .
feeding the world with gm crops the biotech lobby group , agricultural biotechnology council -lrb- abc -rrb- , said the findings showed gm crops had a positive contribution to make .
" these results confirm what the industry has long argued .
the flexibility of gm crops allows them to be grown in a way that benefits the environment , " abc chairman paul rylott said .
the biotech industry group , the supply chain initiative on modified agricultural crops -lrb- scimac -rrb- added that the differences between the crops studied was governed above all by the crop type , herbicides and weed control practices involved , not by the use of genetic modification .
gm food important for development policies the debate on gm food is also reflected in development policies .
the world food summit has set the goal of cutting by half the number of the world 's chronically hungry and under-nourished people by 2015 .
yet progress has been slow in these efforts , the u.n. food and agriculture organization said in view of world food day on thursday .
this is where gm food enter the picture .
many supporters say precisely these types of crops can be adapted to grow and flourish in the often difficult environment of many developing nations .
the chairman of germany 's christian democrat parliamentary working group on consumer protection and nutrition , peter harry carstensen , said he welcomed all international efforts to ensure adequate supplies of food for the world .
" it should be obvious to those responsible that gene technology can be the decisive factor in coping with that challenge , " he said .

here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the pope celebrates 25 years at the helm of the catholic church on thursday .
his supporters point to his triumphs , while his critics point to his weaknesses .
meanwhile , the ailing pope powers on into the next century . the polish-born karol wojtyla was the first non-italian to ascend to the holy seat and in the quarter century since he was named pope john paul ii , he has helped to make history , redefining his role in a new media age , contributing to the fall of communism and helping to bring the jewish and catholic faiths closer together .
for many , he embodies the modern face of catholicism , for others he is too deeply tied to the past .
a modern pope in touch with the people ?
pope john paul ii re-invented the role of the pope like no other pontiff who served before him .
born on may 18 , 1920 , in poland , he was the first pope to travel the world and the first to take advantage of the new media age , where his words and image were disseminated around the world .
in short , he become a worldwide superstar .
whether he traveled to war-torn beirut , a youth conference in canada , communist poland , or the philippines , he always attracted a crowd that hung on to his every word .
in the philippines , he spoke before an audience of four million people , the largest group ever gathered together for a single event .
indeed , the pope - then and now - is celebrated like a popstar .
the world has never before seen a pope who seems so close to the people , so genuinely in touch .
in younger years , he went hiking , swimming , and skiing .
and during all his travels - more than 100 trips - he has always sought closer contact to his audiences .
helping to shape history two events , the holocaust and the fall of communism , have helped shape pope john paul ii 's time as pontiff , and those watershed moments may largely define his legacy .
when he was growing up in poland , the young man then known as karol wojtyla went to school alongside jews .
during wwii , the theology student was himself oppressed by the nazis and forced to hide his studies for the priesthood .
however , after the end of the war , he was still alive - the same could not be said for most of his childhood friends .
the pope has since done much to bring the two faiths together .
he went to the death camps to apologize for the church 's role in anti-semitism .
four years ago , he visited the wailing wall in jerusalem and yad vashem , a memorial center dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
" the catholic church is deeply saddened by the hatred and persecution and display of anti-semitism directed against the jews by christians , " he said .
at the same time , the pope witnessed the end of communism , and according to many experts , helped to bring about its demise through his support for the polish resistance group solidarity .
on frequent visits to his native poland , where the people were ruled by an often oppressive communist regime , he offered words of encouragement .
the church , particularly in poland , was active in opposing the communist regime .
and most recently , the pope voiced his opposition to the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a move which gained him even more supporters .
critics charge the pope is too conservative yet despite these credentials , the pope still has many critics , who point to his conservative sexual politics , position on abortion , women in the church and celibacy - among many other things - and claim they are simply too stringently tied to the past .
most recently , the catholic church ignited a firestorm of controversy , when it claimed that condoms were not effective in aids prevention .
cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , the president of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , said that , " relying on condoms is like betting on your own death . "
these statements prompted the u.n. to respond with a statement stating that the vatican 's position was scientifically incorrect .
in germany , the bishops engaged in a back-and-forth with the pope over the issue of counselling pregnant women .
under german law , women seeking an abortion must go to counselling and obtain an official certificate .
the counselling was often provided by the catholic church , but the pope wanted bishops in germany to put an end to the practice - no longer counselling these women and no longer providing them with the certificate .
it sparked a revolt within the ranks of germany 's bishops , who argued that by providing the service , they were sometimes able to convince women not to go through with an abortion .
in the end , the german bishops settled for a compromise : they continue to offer the counselling , but they now insert a disclaimer into the certificate , stating that it can not be used to obtain a legal abortion . it seems in matters of morals and sexual ethics , the german bishops - who are slightly more liberal by conservative vatican standards - wish they had a more modern leader .
an ailing pope at times pope john paul ii 's openness cost him dearly , particularly in 1981 when turkish right-wing extremist ali agca made an attempt on his life .
an emergency operation saved him , but today the pope still suffers complications from those injuries .
and with the onset of parkinson 's disease in the early 1990s , he has been forced to retreat further from public life , significantly reducing his schedule .
but as the pope advances in age and ever more visibly suffers the effects of parkinson 's disease , some wonder if he is still calling the shots and how much longer he will be able to do so .
he ca n't walk anymore and his speech is often hard to understand and slurred .
" he 's clear as a bell and as sharp as he ever was , " cardinal edmund casimir shokai , the chief administrator of the vatican and a former archbishop of detroit told the new york times recently .
" clearly , he ca n't cover as much territory as he once did . "
ten pontiffs serving before pope john paul ii have stepped down .
but those on the inside of the vatican say the pope is very unlikely to do the same .
he himself has said that the father of the family never resigns .
the pope , at the age of 83 after 25 years in service has seen the number of catholics worldwide increase by 40 percent during his tenure , to 1.1 billion .
with an ever-growing extended family , he continues to press on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback some critics believe the pope has pursued religious policies that are too conservative for the modern world - others say they do n't go far enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's path to reform labor market reforms spelled out revamping germany ’ s pension system a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms german government accelerates tax cuts to boost economy germany -pipe- 17.10.2003 a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .
here ’ s an agenda 2010 overview . health care reform on sept .
26 , germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , passed a law that would reduce monthly premium payments for the national healthcare system from 14.3 percent of an employee ’ s income to 13.6 percent next year and 12.15 percent by 2006 .
as health insurance payments are split by employers and employees , the reduced premium is aimed at lowering germany ’ s staggering non-wage labor costs .
to finance the cuts , the public health fund will no longer finance dentures or replacement teeth and will require a patient co-pay for doctor visits and prescriptions .
the reforms are expected to save insurance companies up to € 20 billion .
labor market reform a second reform bill passed on sept .
26 seeks to make germany ’ s heavily regulated labor market more flexible .
it reduces to 12 months the maximum duration a person can receive unemployment benefits after losing a job and also makes it easier for companies to hire and fire employees .
older employees , however , could receive unemployment benefits for up to 18 months .
labor office reorganization a crucial component in the government ’ s reform package , passed in an effort to reduce unemployment , is a massive reorganization of the federal labor office .
the office will be modeled after a private placement agency and rechristened as the federal job agency , with responsibility for managing unemployment benefits and finding placements for jobless .
the law also requires companies to immediately inform the office if an employee has been given notice and to free up employees for job hunting so they can find other work before they become unemployed .
the office would also have the ability to dock benefits for people who refuse to take employment .
merging unemployment and welfare the hartz iv law calls for unemployment and welfare benefits to be merged and spur those without a job into action .
under the plan , unemployed persons capable of working would be given what the government is describing as " unemployment benefit ii " after their eligibility for unemployment runs out .
unlike the current benefit for the long-term unemployed , which pays out as much as 57 percent of a person ’ s last regular net income , the new benefit would be capped at € 345 in western germany and € 331 in the east .
a person may not be eligible to receive this second unemployment benefit if they have a working spouse or has assets exceeding € 13,000 .
tax cut the third phase of a previously approved german tax reform would be bumped up to 2004 from its originally planned implementation in 2005 .
the reform will change the country ’ s progressive tax rate from 19.9 percent to 15 percent at the lowest level and from 48.5 percent to 42 percent at the highest level .
the cut is expected to save taxpayers a total of € 21.8 billion .
chancellor gerhard schröder is hoping the cut will spur consumer spending and provide a needed boost to the country ’ s ailing retail sector .
the government plans to finance the tax cut by slashing federal subsidies and privatizing government-held properties .
communal financing german cities are running at a record deficit this year , with a € 10 billion shortfall in funding .
the government ’ s plan seeks to increase the percentage received by communities of the local business tax from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent .
the tax would also be extended to previously excluded freelancers , doctors and lawyers as well as to any interest a company earns or any rent or licensing fees it pays .
the government says the plan would put € 4.5 billion in additional funds into city coffers by 2004 and € 5 billion the year after .
the merger of unemployment and welfare benefits is also supposed to save the cities several billion euros .
reform of master craftsmen law under a controversial plan approved by the government earlier this year , mandatory apprenticeships and master craftsman ’ s diplomas would be eliminated in 65 skilled trades , allowing ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
the changes would only apply to less dangerous work like tile-laying , tailors or goldsmiths .
more high-risk jobs , like electricians and opticians , would still be required to go through the lengthy and expensive certification apprenticeships .
social insurance reforms earlier this year , the government commissioned a panel led by bert rürup to issue an advisory plan for saving a social system threatened with collapse by a fast-graying german population .
the key provision of the rürup commission plan , released in august , is to increase the age of pension eligibility from the current 65 to 67 .
it would also reduce pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent of a recipient ’ s former income .
workers would not be eligible for early retirement before the age of 64 , and the annual cost-of-living increase would be reduced by 0.5. percent .
the government is considering the commission 's work as it drafts its own bill for reforming the pension system .
the first reading is expected in november or december .
meanwhile , a commission appointed by the conservative opposition christian democrats and led by former german president roman herzog has also called for the retirement age to be increased to 67 , a proposal that has split the christian democratic union internally and led to a rift with its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the herzog commission has also called for a flat monthly health insurance premium of € 264 for all germans , a move it says would save the public health fund € 27 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after nearly four years of testing , the scientists from the royal society concluded that gm rapeseed and sugar beet were more harmful to local wildlife than conventionally-grown plants .
but they also found that fields grown with gm maize fared better .
since 1998 , researchers backed by the government 's scientific steering committee had been evaluating the impact of gm herbicides on the local environment and comparing the results with studies on nearby fields where conventional weed killers were used on non-gm varieties .
results may differ from case-to-case the results revealed significant differences in the effect on biodiversity when managing gm crops as compared to conventional varieties , project coordinator les firbank said .
" the study emphasizes the importance of the weeds growing among crop plants in sustaining natural communities within , and adjacent to , farmers ' fields , " he explained .
but , he pointed out , the results were only applicable to the three crops studied , and only under the regimes of herbicide usage which were employed .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "
germans will still be entitled to their old-school unemployment benefits , based on a percentage of their income - sometimes up to 50 percent - though the length of time they can claim this benefit will be reduced from 32 months to 12 months -lrb- 18 months for the older unemployed -rrb- thanks to legislation approved in september .
after 12 months , the long term unemployed will switch over to so-called " unemployment ii . "
this new benefit will be based on the rate paid out to social assistance recipients , which is not related to former income levels and is significantly less than " unemployment i " benefit .
critics have charged that these laws could result in wage dumping , with highly-qualified professionals forced to take low-paying jobs or risk punishment .
and they worry that the laws do not offer enough protection to the long-term unemployed , particularly older unemployment recipients .
not an easy road ahead the next few months will not be easy .
if the legislation is approved by a majority in the bundestag , which last-minute negotiations with rebellious left-wing members of the spd seem to have secured , schröder and his party still face a tough road ahead .
the legislation package will then move on to the upper house , the bundesrat , which represents the states .
there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

mehdorn had predicted that the rail operator could be publicly traded starting in 2005 .
in his position paper , schmidt said that while the privatization plans make sense , the company 's figures should be firmly in the black for at least three years before it is listed on the stock exchange .
deutsche bahn , one of germany 's biggest employers , remained in the red for the second year in a row last year with a net loss of € 468 million -lrb- $ 544 million -rrb- . more briefs 17.10.2003 -pipe- bankruptcies continue to climb 17.10.2003 -pipe- government approves tax breaks for insurers 16.10.2003 -pipe- air france and klm put pen to paper 16.10.2003 -pipe- charter firm aero lloyd declares insolvency 15.10.2003 -pipe- german government lowers growth forecasts 15.10.2003 -pipe- germans working under table could face jail time 15.10.2003 -pipe- volkswagen to increase new golf production 15.10.2003 -pipe- stranded eu airline passengers entitled to compensation radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the court ruled that the militant stance of the group , which is based in cologne , was unconstitutional and a threat to democracy .
they rejected arguments that the ban , originally imposed by interior minister otto schily in 2001 , contravened germany 's guarantee of freedom of religion .
schily welcomed the decision and said he hoped that it would be possible to speed up the extradition process of its leader , metin kaplan , who is wanted by turkish authorities for treason .
he is accused of plotting in 1998 to crash an aircraft loaded with explosives into the mausoleum of kemal ataturk , the founder of the modern turkish state .
kaplan 's caliphate state was founded in 1984 in cologne and before the ban had around 1,100 members . more briefs 17.10.2003 -pipe- german arrested for spying for bulgaria 16.10.2003 -pipe- german citizens await evacuation from bolivia 16.10.2003 -pipe- case closed on hitler-saluting pooch 15.10.2003 -pipe- german police hunt for ' stupid ' burglar 15.10.2003 -pipe- ‘ chancellor ’ chirac to stand in for schröder 15.10.2003 -pipe- historian claims a ‘ frau thatcher ’ could save germany 15.10.2003 -pipe- germany , u.s. sign joint terror investigation agreement 14.10.2003 -pipe- thousands greet women 's soccer team radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .

friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes . in what will likely be a very close vote , the german bundestag will decide on controversial labor market reforms friday .
after a week of last minute negotiations and concessions , chancellor gerhard schröder has managed to rein in the rebellious members of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- party and secure a majority .
with all the members of the spd and enough greens - the spd 's coalition partner - supporting the legislation entitled " agenda 2010 , " it should squeak by the lower house with 305 ' yes ' votes .
the opposition parties , with 297 votes , will not be able to hold-up things in the bundestag .
they will have to wait for their chance when the package of bills moves on to the opposition-controlled bundesrat - the upper house of parliament - for approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz , a green party member , says he wo n't support the labor market reforms .
but having battled hard to get this far , one vote will elude schröder , that of a green .
call him a conscientious objector , werner schulz says he wo n't support the legislation .
in an article the tageszeitung newspaper schulz wrote on friday : " i can not vote for this reform package , because it , unfortunately , does little to change the unemployment situation , and goes partly in the wrong direction . "
to avoid his ' no ' vote coming to the opposition 's aid , schulz said he would abstain .
hours before members of the bundestag must make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , which includes restructuring the federal labor agency and combining the previously separate unemployment and social welfare benefits .
he said the two controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
last minute wrangling the weary chancellor 's true adversaries - with the political power to block his reform program - are the rebellious left of his own party and the conservatives in the opposition cdu .
for a chancellor who has staked his political future on the successful implementation of a series of reforms - including healthcare , pension , tax and labor market reform - schröder also knows he ca n't afford to suffer any more significant setbacks .
the weeks leading up to friday 's vote have been tumultuous .
during september 's vote on healthcare reform , six left-wing members of schröder 's own spd revolted and voted against the legislation .
thus , schröder was robbed of his so-called " chancellor 's majority " in the bundestag .
schröder was so incensed , that he staked his political future on the implementation of " agenda 2010 , " threatening to resign if he was unsuccessful .
in this particular case , however , september 's revolt proved little more than a political embarrassment , as the ruling coalition had carefully negotiated the content of the healthcare legislation with the opposition cdu prior to the vote and could therefore count on enough support from them to carry it through .
not so in matters related to labor reform .
the cdu has its own ideas about how labor market reform should proceed , so every vote from the chancellor 's own ranks will count this time around .
schröder and high-ranking spd officials do not want to see a repeat of the events of september .
when earlier this month the same six left-wing party members threatened to once again go against the party line , it was enough to bring the party leaders to the negotiating table .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .

why have german labor market reforms proven so controversial ?
here 's a look at the changes the bundestag will vote on friday and the difficult road ahead . left-wing parliamentarians within german chancellor gerhard schröder 's governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have voiced concern over the nature of the labor market reforms .
and one member of the government coalition partner , the green party , has said he wo n't support the legislation .
so what 's all the fuss about ?
all told , the legislation will fundamentally change the nature of the german welfare and unemployment system .
even if he wins the battle in the bundestag today , schröder still has a tough fight ahead of him .
and the proposed reforms may undergo yet another round of revisions - should the members of the opposition-dominated bundesrat have their way - before they take effect .
the gist of it essentially , the legislation is comprised of two major parts , the hartz iii and the hartz iv laws , both taking their name from the special extra governmental commission - headed by the volkswagen manager peter hartz - that was set up to review the situation and propose changes .
hartz iii proposes a massive re-organization of the federal labor office , remodeling it after private job placement agencies and renaming it the federal job agency .
the agency will be responsible for managing unemployment benefits and finding job placements for the unemployed .
the agency will also have the power to dock the benefits of people who refuse the jobs offered to them , a controversial issue .
the hartz iv law calls for merging the country 's unemployment and welfare benefits into a new benefit called " unemployment ii . "

there the christian democratis party and its bavarian sister party have the majority .
cdu leaders have already suggested that they will not support the current version of the reforms .
" the law dubbed hartz iv - as it stands now - will not get our support , " said roland koch , hesse 's cdu premier .
" it 's not sufficient to solve our nation 's problems , to create more work and more jobs and make sure that those who are capable of working do . "
premier dieter althaus of thuringia , also a cdu member , said his party has plans of its own : " we will make our own suggestions - in fact they have already been presented to the bundesrat - and i suggest that we look at both drafts and bring them closer together . "
in response to these comments , franz müntefering , the head of the spd parliamentary group , said , " we will not make any unconditional compromises . "
another round of negotiations will probably be necessary .
members of the bundesrat do n't have the power to overrule the legislation , but they can send it back to the bundestag .
then , ever more delicate compromises will have to be hammered out in the two bodies ' arbitration committee .
so , for the next few months at least , the saga will continue .
but all parties involved will have to reach some kind of agreement by december 19 - when the legislative period ends - if they want to implement the changes by january 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

shares plunged 7 % in after hours trading as investors worried about the long term outlook .
there have been some fears that ebay stock , that has so far defied the bursting of the dot.com bubble , has become overvalued .
the company 's market value is just over $ 37bn , making it worth almost 50 % more than general motors , the world 's largest carmaker .

john swinney , the leader of the scottish national party , wants mps from all political parties to vote against the fees at westminster .
he believes higher fees south of the border would place scottish universities at a huge financial disadvantage .
mr swinney made the call in a speech at dundee university , warning that the fees could be used to avoid spending more taxes on higher education south of the border .
but the conservatives said they would abstain from any vote , rather than joining the snp in voting against the proposals .
a scottish tory party spokesman said peter duncan , the sole scots tory mp , would continue his stance of not voting on english issues .
" the sad reality of labour 's majority at westminster is that tony blair is likely to get his way if the whips dragoon english mps through the lobby , " he said .
" the decent thing for scottish labour mps to do is to absent themselves from the vote , rather than be instrumental in damaging scottish universities . "
" if we had the english suggesting that scottish universities should be run in a particular way , he -lsb- swinney -rsb- would be the first to object " ian davidson mp he added : " with a uk market in higher education and large cross-border flows of staff and students , we must have a uk-wide solution to higher education funding .
" that is why a nationalist response to this issue will always be inadequate . "
ian davidson , labour mp for glasgow pollok , accused mr swinney of hypocrisy .
he said : " john swinney is trying to control how english universities are financed .
if we had the english suggesting that scottish universities should be run in a particular way , he would be the first to object . "
mr swinney had earlier told the bbc 's good morning scotland programme : " top-up fees pose a real threat to scottish higher education because it puts us at a competitive disadvantage to institutions south of the border .
" that will affect staff , research and development and the whole effectiveness of the higher education sector in scotland .
" all political parties recognise top-up fees to be bad for scotland and we should unite to oppose them . "
on thursday , snp mps said they would break their self-imposed ban on voting on english issues in the commons because of the damage english fees would do to scottish universities .
mr swinney has called on scottish labour and tory mps to join nationalists and the liberal democrats - who have opposed fees in holyrood and westminster - and vote against the government .

they revealed that wales has the highest number of children living in poverty , and that at the other end of the spectrum , a majority of pensioners in wales depend on the state pension and other state benefits as their main source of income .

the report showed : - wales has the highest rate of child poverty in the uk -lrb- 33 % -rrb- wales has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in europe the youth unemployment rate is 28.6 % wales has more pensioners than the rest of the uk , and half have annual incomes of less than £ 10,000 .

the report , called from the cradle to the grave , used statistics gathered from a variety of sources - including help the aged , save the children , citizen 's advice bureau and official welsh assembly government statistics .
they revealed that wales has the highest number of children living in poverty , and that at the other end of the spectrum , a majority of pensioners in wales depend on the state pension and other state benefits as their main source of income .
the report has been released on friday to coincide with the united nations day for the eradication of poverty .
the apnc is calling on the welsh assembly government to put the eradication of poverty at the top of its agenda .
francis ballin , volunteer co-ordinator for the organisation , said : " the scale of deprivation experienced here in wales is surely unacceptable for an economy as strong as the uk 's .
" rundown , hostile neighbourhoods , lack of access to social opportunity , poor health and discriminatory attitudes all conspire to lower the quality of life profoundly .
" we want the assembly to ensure that people experiencing poverty in wales have opportunities to meet decision makers and to influence their political decisions . "
the report showed : - wales has the highest rate of child poverty in the uk -lrb- 33 % -rrb- wales has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in europe the youth unemployment rate is 28.6 % wales has more pensioners than the rest of the uk , and half have annual incomes of less than £ 10,000 .
in june , a new assembly development , aimed at helping the more deprived areas of wales , began work .
the social justice department was created when first minister rhodri morgan named his new cabinet in the wake of the assembly election in may .
social justice minister edwina hart 's main weapon in tackling deprivation is the £ 83m communities first programme .
the scheme aims to tackle deprivation in areas largely concentrated within the west wales and the south wales valleys which receive money under the european union 's objective one programme .

the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said it was becoming increasingly concerned about the practice , which is illegal in the uk .
docking involves the shortening of an animal 's tail a few days after birth , by amputation or banding , without the use of anaesthetic .
the charity 's inspectors said they had received reports from a number of vets regarding the high percentage of dogs coming through their surgeries with docked tails .
senior inspector mark lumgair said : " our concern is that people are apparently unaware that tail docking is prohibited under the veterinary surgeons act 1966 .
people seem to be unaware that this procedure should not be carried out automatically just because of the breed type sspca " one of the main problems is that certain breeds continue to be recognised without tails by the kennel club , such as boxers and dobermans , but dogs with full tails should be considered the norm .
" several vets have expressed concern at the number of people who attend their surgeries and own dogs with docked tails .
" people seem to be unaware that this procedure should not be carried out automatically just because of the breed type . "
in 1991 , the uk government amended the veterinary surgeons act , thereby prohibiting the docking of dog 's tails by lay persons from 1 july 1993 .
now , only veterinary surgeons are , by law , allowed to dock and only in cases where it is in the best interests of the health of the dog .
following the government move , the council of the royal college of veterinary surgeons in november 1992 , ruled docking to be unethical , " unless for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons " .
furthermore , the circumstances in which the royal college considered prophylactic docking to be acceptable were so hedged with conditions as to make the routine docking of puppies by veterinary surgeons extremely difficult .
vets who continue to dock for cosmetic purposes risk disciplinary action , including being struck off the professional register .

it is hoped that the initiative by metroline , which has 1,089 buses in its london fleet , will make services run to the timetable and in turn increase the use of public transport .
using mobile phone operator orange 's gprs network , the control room can locate the position of a bus along any route and work out the time and distance between buses .
if they are off the timetabled schedule , the control centre sends the driver a text message which flashes up on the dashboard , telling them to maintain the correct intervals so they arrive on time at stops .

one of the government 's key initiatives to tackle child poverty is to provide childcare but the researchers said children can suffer other ill-effects if their parents go out to work .
the researchers followed 120 mothers and 143 children , aged between six months and three-and-a-half years , from hackney .

one of the government 's key initiatives to tackle child poverty is to provide childcare but the researchers said children can suffer other ill-effects if their parents go out to work .
the researchers followed 120 mothers and 143 children , aged between six months and three-and-a-half years , from hackney .
they found that although more mothers who had access to child care were employed , their weekly income was no more likely to rise above £ 200- per-week than those who did not .

" tackling low pay , changing the benefit structure and reducing the costs of day care to poor families may be equally important components of an anti-poverty strategy , " the researchers said .
but the report did say : " better access to out-of-home day-care facilities for children is considered to be an important anti-poverty strategy , since it might enable poor parents to take up paid work , thus increasing household income .

the midsize jet has lost favour to more economical planes , including the smaller 737s and the jumbo 7e7s now being developed .
the plane manufacturer has struggled to cope with a slump in demand from us airlines , the traditional outlet for its 757 jets .
the announcement came just hours after continental airlines announced that it was downgrading its existing orders for six 757s to the cheaper 737s .
" this decision reflects the market reality for the 757 , " said alan mulally , boeing 's chief executive .
" the fact that continental wants to move from 757s into more 737s is a clear indication of what most of the carriers have decided . "
job fears workers in seattle , where the 757 is produced were braced for job cuts . " it 's like the final nail in the coffin , " said matthew hardy , who works on 757 systems installation .
" right now , the economy is bleeding , the airlines are bleeding , and there 's nothing to look forward to except -lsb- building -rsb- pieces of the 7e7 . "
boeing has already eliminated 35,560 jobs since the september 2001 terrorist attacks , a total that is expected to reach 40,000 by the end of the year .
signs of hope the airline industry , already coping with over capacity , has been in financial turmoil since the terrorist attacks decreased passenger numbers .
on thursday , two us airlines - continental and northwest - gave the industry some hope that things are picking up , by both reporting a quarterly profit .
but , despite the turnaround , orders for new planes are still significantly lower and there are still many planes which have been taken out of service and are parked in the desert .
boeing , which is also struggling to compete with its european rival airbus , does not expect a pick-up in demand for orders until 2006 at the earliest .
boeing has produced more than 1,000 of the single-aisle 200-seater 757s since they were first rolled off the production line in 1982 .
the last 757 will be produced towards the end of next year .

but , despite the turnaround , orders for new planes are still significantly lower and there are still many planes which have been taken out of service and are parked in the desert .
boeing , which is also struggling to compete with its european rival airbus , does not expect a pick-up in demand for orders until 2006 at the earliest .
boeing has produced more than 1,000 of the single-aisle 200-seater 757s since they were first rolled off the production line in 1982 .
the last 757 will be produced towards the end of next year .

dave hay 's train in vain janet powell 's car share verdict bbc news online challenged selected users to give up their cars for their daily commute for work for a week .
transport minister kim howells gave his response to how they got on .
dave hay swapped his 20-mile car commute from knaresborough to york for a walk , bus and train to work for a week .
but he said he could not keep it up because it left him with little time to see his family and cost four times as much .
dr howells ' advice for mr hay was brief : " i 'd say that under those circumstances he 's wise to stick with his car and see his family and have breakfast with them . "
another challenger , steve clarke , swapped his 20 mile car journey from fleet in hampshire to bracknell for a 12-mile cycle ride to work .
it took him twice as long but mr clarke said it was " one of the best decisions i 've ever made " and is even thinking about selling the family 's second car .

the commission says britain failed to give the required notice when authorising nuclear waste removal from devonport dockyard last year .
the commission claims eu health assessment and radiation protection safeguards required under the euratom treaty were ignored .
the uk government says the rules do not apply to military installations .
the euratom treaty lays down basic safety standards against the dangers from ionizing radiation . "
the commission and the uk disagree on the application of the euratom treaty in respect of military installations " mod spokesman the commission was informed in january 2002 that the uk environment agency was about to authorise nuclear waste disposal from the devonport dockyard plant following the refitting and refuelling of nuclear submarines .
a commission statement said the authorisation was granted " without taking account of euratom treaty provisions and legislation regarding the protection of the health of workers and the general public . "
radiological impact the statement said : " since the disposal of radioactive waste may affect another member state from a health point of view , assessment of the radiological impact of such waste by the commission remains crucial . "
officials sent a warning letter to the government earlier this year , but said on thursday the case was now being referred to the european court of justice in luxembourg because the issue remains " unresolved " .
the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- has long argued that the treaty does not apply to military installations .
an mod spokesman said : " the commission and the uk disagree on the application of the euratom treaty in respect of military installations .
