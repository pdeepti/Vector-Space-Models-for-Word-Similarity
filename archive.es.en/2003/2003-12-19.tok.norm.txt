former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .

“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2003 european probe closes in on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 slowly moves away from its mother ship .
after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .
we ’ re doing the detective story by looking for clues , not by finding a dead or live body in the library .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr valéry giscard d 'estaing , cowen ’ s cautious tone was echoed by valery giscard d ’ estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- , former french president and steward of the eu draft , who for the first on thursday publicly weighed in on the debate over the failed summit .
giscard called the collapse of the summit " a great missed opportunity " and said he did not expect negotiations to resume until late 2004 or early 2005 . " a precipitous move , instead of producing -lrb- agreement -rrb- would probably reinforce antagonisms , so it would be better to have a prudent , cautious approach , " giscard said .
" it would be very unwise to set new deadlines .
things have to be given time to mature , " he added .
giscard also for the first time publicly disclosed that he had favored a higher population threshold for majority voting in eu decision-making , but had been overruled by his peers . eu budget a worry though the constitution is expected to dominate discussions in brussels for the next several months , the irish will also have to deal with the debate on the eu ’ s 2007-2013 budget next month and ensure it does not degenerate into a shouting match between net contributors to the budget and net recipients . the risks have already been heightened with germany and other net contributors suggesting the eu budget needed to be capped , a move that would penalize spain and poland , two big net beneficiaries of eu aid that are blamed for blocking the constitution treaty .
both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .
cowen said on thursday that the existing fiscal rules that limit budget deficits contained enough flexibility and had been appropriately applied on the deficits of germany and france .
" of course we all support the application of the rules of the pact , including the excessive deficit procedure , " cowen said .
" in our view , the rules contain an inherent flexibility and it ’ s appropriate that this flexibility be applied with common sense and consistency . " apart from tackling the obvious hurdles ahead , ireland has said its priorities will be to boost economic reform and competition in the eu , job-creation and crime-fighting .
" competition , growth and jobs .
those are the questions , according to which our citizens correctly judge the success of the european project , " cowen said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.12.2003 germany lifts red light on televised porn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will soon be able to swap the xxx booths for the comfort of home .
the pornography world will soon be able to perform to a wider audience following a decision to allow german cable television to screen explicit adult entertainment . the decision by germany 's association of regulatory authorities for broadcasting , -lrb- dlm -rrb- will allow the premier tv cable service to offer a full palette of pornographic films on a pay-for-view basis .
the private station will use two providers of erotic and pornographic films to satisfy its viewers .
blue movie , which is part of the vienna-based media organization telemedienst gmbh , plans to offer subscribers the choice of three 90 minute films per day , with the selection changing on a daily basis . erotic media will also be baring all on premiere come the start of 2004 .
the swiss company has an arsenal of some 3,000 films and is already involved in the more soft-core beate uhse ag erotic programming , which is already screened on premiere .
an original request from erotic media to allow viewers non-stop access to its films was rejected by the dlm .
the regulatory body insists that the only way to keep graphic sexual scenes from reaching innocent eyes is to operate premier 's porno tv on a pay-for-view basis available only to subscribing adults in possession of a smartcard .
users will use the cards , which will not be on sale to minors , to identify themselves each time they want to watch a film .
protecting german youth ?
premier manager georg kofler heralded the decision as a great success for youth media protection in germany , adding that pornographic programming on offer via satellite and over the internet had no regard for germany 's youth protection laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stricter laws for youth protection than many european nations , forbbiding the tv broadcast of films with a minimum age rating of 16 years between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m.
but at late night , german viewers can tune into all kinds of titillating television , with the air waves full of late-night sex chat shows , endless strings of adverts for telephone sex , and soft-core porn galore .
few germans have problems with on-air nudity and many are equally unbashful about their interest in eroticism and pornography .
most dvd and video stores across the country have a massive selection of soft and hard porn lining its backroom shelves and the beate uhse erotic empire has become an integral part of germany 's main street shopping landscape .
media service germany 's strict youth protection laws forbid television stations from broadcasting hard-core pornography , but the dlm got around this issue by categorizing the planned porno tv as a " media service " on the grounds that it would only be on offer to a self-contained group of users .
the dlm , however , was critical of the fact that ' blue movie ' is based in austria .
" it must be avoided that the effective german youth protection laws are weakened from abroad , " dlm chairman wolfgang thaenert told the reuters news agency .
but a spokeswoman for telemediendienst gmbh was quick to point out that the company is a subsidiary of premier and that although they are based in vienna and the films are produced there , the broadcast studio is in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. artist to erect installation for hamburg 's red light district controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .

hans-werner sinn , president of the munich-based research institute said next year ’ s tax cuts should account for 0.2 percent of the expected growth , with a further 0.5 percentage points generated by the higher number of working days in 2004 compared with 2003 .
sinn told reporters , " in particular , we expect growth impulses through export , because it ’ s powered by growth of the global economy . "
he however said that export-related growth still remained an uncertain factor when it came to overall growth expectations , because it ’ s still unclear how high the euro will rise against the dollar .
sinn also pointed out that a recovery in the german labor market is still not in sight .
he said unemployment will ease slightly to an average 4.3 million people in 2004 from 4.38 million in 2003 , but only as a result of statistical adjustments . more briefs 18.12.2003 -pipe- siemens builds nuclear plant in finland 18.12.2003 -pipe- ultimatum issued for german truck toll system 18.12.2003 -pipe- iraqis want german business know-how 18.12.2003 -pipe- sharp rise in german business confidence 18.12.2003 -pipe- court drops case against boris becker 17.12.2003 -pipe- u.s. firm bids for german chemical company celanese 17.12.2003 -pipe- german companies worried about their money in iraq 17.12.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler trial suspended amid new evidence radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the agreement , which for the first time involves long-time measures on protecting cod and hake and raising their stocks , is in response to studies by environmentalists who have been warning for years that the fish species will be wiped out through over-fishing if the eu doesn ’ t take drastic action .
but the deal has run into criticism by fishing lobbies , who say it leaves fishermen out in the cold .
eu fisheries minister franz fischler tried to soften the blow .
" the coming years will not be easy for some fishermen .
but the long-term recovery plans do give fishermen prospects for the future .
eu funding is available to act as a social shock absorber , " fischler told a news conference .
" we also took account of social aspects .
we are talking about thousands of families who live from the fishing sector and depend on it .
it is not necessary for us to close whole areas .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .
we ’ re doing the detective story by looking for clues , not by finding a dead or live body in the library .

for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .
we ’ re doing the detective story by looking for clues , not by finding a dead or live body in the library .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.12.2003 germany lifts red light on televised porn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will soon be able to swap the xxx booths for the comfort of home .
the pornography world will soon be able to perform to a wider audience following a decision to allow german cable television to screen explicit adult entertainment . the decision by germany 's association of regulatory authorities for broadcasting , -lrb- dlm -rrb- will allow the premier tv cable service to offer a full palette of pornographic films on a pay-for-view basis .
the private station will use two providers of erotic and pornographic films to satisfy its viewers .
blue movie , which is part of the vienna-based media organization telemedienst gmbh , plans to offer subscribers the choice of three 90 minute films per day , with the selection changing on a daily basis . erotic media will also be baring all on premiere come the start of 2004 .
the swiss company has an arsenal of some 3,000 films and is already involved in the more soft-core beate uhse ag erotic programming , which is already screened on premiere .
an original request from erotic media to allow viewers non-stop access to its films was rejected by the dlm .
the regulatory body insists that the only way to keep graphic sexual scenes from reaching innocent eyes is to operate premier 's porno tv on a pay-for-view basis available only to subscribing adults in possession of a smartcard .
users will use the cards , which will not be on sale to minors , to identify themselves each time they want to watch a film .
protecting german youth ?
premier manager georg kofler heralded the decision as a great success for youth media protection in germany , adding that pornographic programming on offer via satellite and over the internet had no regard for germany 's youth protection laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stricter laws for youth protection than many european nations , forbbiding the tv broadcast of films with a minimum age rating of 16 years between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m.
but at late night , german viewers can tune into all kinds of titillating television , with the air waves full of late-night sex chat shows , endless strings of adverts for telephone sex , and soft-core porn galore .
few germans have problems with on-air nudity and many are equally unbashful about their interest in eroticism and pornography .
most dvd and video stores across the country have a massive selection of soft and hard porn lining its backroom shelves and the beate uhse erotic empire has become an integral part of germany 's main street shopping landscape .
media service germany 's strict youth protection laws forbid television stations from broadcasting hard-core pornography , but the dlm got around this issue by categorizing the planned porno tv as a " media service " on the grounds that it would only be on offer to a self-contained group of users .
the dlm , however , was critical of the fact that ' blue movie ' is based in austria .
" it must be avoided that the effective german youth protection laws are weakened from abroad , " dlm chairman wolfgang thaenert told the reuters news agency .
but a spokeswoman for telemediendienst gmbh was quick to point out that the company is a subsidiary of premier and that although they are based in vienna and the films are produced there , the broadcast studio is in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. artist to erect installation for hamburg 's red light district controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .
fossil remains suggest that both modern humans and neanderthals lived in europe during this period , which makes it difficult to say for sure which group was the creative talent behind the carvings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend . -lrb- 23 november 2003 -rrb- 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .

he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .

he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .

he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .
fossil remains suggest that both modern humans and neanderthals lived in europe during this period , which makes it difficult to say for sure which group was the creative talent behind the carvings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend . -lrb- 23 november 2003 -rrb- 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .

the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .

the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .

the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .

once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .

the swiss company has an arsenal of some 3,000 films and is already involved in the more soft-core beate uhse ag erotic programming , which is already screened on premiere .
an original request from erotic media to allow viewers non-stop access to its films was rejected by the dlm .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .

“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .

he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .

“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .

he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.12.2003 germany lifts red light on televised porn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will soon be able to swap the xxx booths for the comfort of home .
the pornography world will soon be able to perform to a wider audience following a decision to allow german cable television to screen explicit adult entertainment . the decision by germany 's association of regulatory authorities for broadcasting , -lrb- dlm -rrb- will allow the premier tv cable service to offer a full palette of pornographic films on a pay-for-view basis .
the private station will use two providers of erotic and pornographic films to satisfy its viewers .
blue movie , which is part of the vienna-based media organization telemedienst gmbh , plans to offer subscribers the choice of three 90 minute films per day , with the selection changing on a daily basis . erotic media will also be baring all on premiere come the start of 2004 .
the swiss company has an arsenal of some 3,000 films and is already involved in the more soft-core beate uhse ag erotic programming , which is already screened on premiere .
an original request from erotic media to allow viewers non-stop access to its films was rejected by the dlm .
the regulatory body insists that the only way to keep graphic sexual scenes from reaching innocent eyes is to operate premier 's porno tv on a pay-for-view basis available only to subscribing adults in possession of a smartcard .
users will use the cards , which will not be on sale to minors , to identify themselves each time they want to watch a film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.12.2003 ireland outlines eu presidency goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spotlight will be on irish prime minister bertie ahern when he takes over the eu presidency on jan .
1 .
following the eu ’ s failure to approve a new constitution and the effective suspension of the bloc ’ s budgetary rules , ireland has decided to take a cautious approach during its six-month presidency starting next year . irish prime minister bertie ahern will have a full plate when he takes over the reins of the european union from his italian counterpart silvio berlusconi on january 1 , 2004 .
italy ’ s eu presidency was marked by discord and strife within the 15 member bloc . in particular , disagreement over the breakdown of crucial talks on the eu ’ s future constitution last weekend and the tattered deficit rules of the euro ’ s stability pact will cast a shadow over the coming months .
add to that the eu ’ s upcoming enlargement in may when 10 countries will join the bloc and ahern will have more than enough to keep him busy . outlining dublin ’ s plans for the eu in the first half of next year , irish foreign minister brian cowen said on thursday ireland would place high priority on tackling the issue of the deadlocked eu constitution talks that pitted germany and france against spain and poland . " we ’ ve had a disagreement .
we ’ ve had a disappointment .
we ’ ve had a setback , " cowen said .
" i have no doubt there will be an agreement .
it ’ s a question of when rather than if . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr valéry giscard d 'estaing , cowen ’ s cautious tone was echoed by valery giscard d ’ estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- , former french president and steward of the eu draft , who for the first on thursday publicly weighed in on the debate over the failed summit .
giscard called the collapse of the summit " a great missed opportunity " and said he did not expect negotiations to resume until late 2004 or early 2005 . " a precipitous move , instead of producing -lrb- agreement -rrb- would probably reinforce antagonisms , so it would be better to have a prudent , cautious approach , " giscard said .
" it would be very unwise to set new deadlines .
things have to be given time to mature , " he added .
giscard also for the first time publicly disclosed that he had favored a higher population threshold for majority voting in eu decision-making , but had been overruled by his peers . eu budget a worry though the constitution is expected to dominate discussions in brussels for the next several months , the irish will also have to deal with the debate on the eu ’ s 2007-2013 budget next month and ensure it does not degenerate into a shouting match between net contributors to the budget and net recipients . the risks have already been heightened with germany and other net contributors suggesting the eu budget needed to be capped , a move that would penalize spain and poland , two big net beneficiaries of eu aid that are blamed for blocking the constitution treaty .
both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .

" we ’ ve had a disagreement .

both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .

following the eu ’ s failure to approve a new constitution and the effective suspension of the bloc ’ s budgetary rules , ireland has decided to take a cautious approach during its six-month presidency starting next year . irish prime minister bertie ahern will have a full plate when he takes over the reins of the european union from his italian counterpart silvio berlusconi on january 1 , 2004 .
italy ’ s eu presidency was marked by discord and strife within the 15 member bloc . in particular , disagreement over the breakdown of crucial talks on the eu ’ s future constitution last weekend and the tattered deficit rules of the euro ’ s stability pact will cast a shadow over the coming months .
add to that the eu ’ s upcoming enlargement in may when 10 countries will join the bloc and ahern will have more than enough to keep him busy . outlining dublin ’ s plans for the eu in the first half of next year , irish foreign minister brian cowen said on thursday ireland would place high priority on tackling the issue of the deadlocked eu constitution talks that pitted germany and france against spain and poland . " we ’ ve had a disagreement .
we ’ ve had a disappointment .
we ’ ve had a setback , " cowen said .
" i have no doubt there will be an agreement .
it ’ s a question of when rather than if . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr valéry giscard d 'estaing , cowen ’ s cautious tone was echoed by valery giscard d ’ estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- , former french president and steward of the eu draft , who for the first on thursday publicly weighed in on the debate over the failed summit .
giscard called the collapse of the summit " a great missed opportunity " and said he did not expect negotiations to resume until late 2004 or early 2005 . " a precipitous move , instead of producing -lrb- agreement -rrb- would probably reinforce antagonisms , so it would be better to have a prudent , cautious approach , " giscard said .
" it would be very unwise to set new deadlines .
things have to be given time to mature , " he added .
giscard also for the first time publicly disclosed that he had favored a higher population threshold for majority voting in eu decision-making , but had been overruled by his peers . eu budget a worry though the constitution is expected to dominate discussions in brussels for the next several months , the irish will also have to deal with the debate on the eu ’ s 2007-2013 budget next month and ensure it does not degenerate into a shouting match between net contributors to the budget and net recipients . the risks have already been heightened with germany and other net contributors suggesting the eu budget needed to be capped , a move that would penalize spain and poland , two big net beneficiaries of eu aid that are blamed for blocking the constitution treaty .
both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .
cowen said on thursday that the existing fiscal rules that limit budget deficits contained enough flexibility and had been appropriately applied on the deficits of germany and france .
" of course we all support the application of the rules of the pact , including the excessive deficit procedure , " cowen said .
" in our view , the rules contain an inherent flexibility and it ’ s appropriate that this flexibility be applied with common sense and consistency . " apart from tackling the obvious hurdles ahead , ireland has said its priorities will be to boost economic reform and competition in the eu , job-creation and crime-fighting .
" competition , growth and jobs .
those are the questions , according to which our citizens correctly judge the success of the european project , " cowen said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .
fossil remains suggest that both modern humans and neanderthals lived in europe during this period , which makes it difficult to say for sure which group was the creative talent behind the carvings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend . -lrb- 23 november 2003 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .

" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .

the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .
fossil remains suggest that both modern humans and neanderthals lived in europe during this period , which makes it difficult to say for sure which group was the creative talent behind the carvings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend . -lrb- 23 november 2003 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .

1 .
following the eu ’ s failure to approve a new constitution and the effective suspension of the bloc ’ s budgetary rules , ireland has decided to take a cautious approach during its six-month presidency starting next year . irish prime minister bertie ahern will have a full plate when he takes over the reins of the european union from his italian counterpart silvio berlusconi on january 1 , 2004 .
italy ’ s eu presidency was marked by discord and strife within the 15 member bloc . in particular , disagreement over the breakdown of crucial talks on the eu ’ s future constitution last weekend and the tattered deficit rules of the euro ’ s stability pact will cast a shadow over the coming months .
add to that the eu ’ s upcoming enlargement in may when 10 countries will join the bloc and ahern will have more than enough to keep him busy . outlining dublin ’ s plans for the eu in the first half of next year , irish foreign minister brian cowen said on thursday ireland would place high priority on tackling the issue of the deadlocked eu constitution talks that pitted germany and france against spain and poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.12.2003 parliament approves sweeping economic reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder failed to secure a majority from his coalition government .
germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .

“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .

a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .

“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .

but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.12.2003 european probe closes in on mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 slowly moves away from its mother ship .
after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .
we ’ re doing the detective story by looking for clues , not by finding a dead or live body in the library .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .
fossil remains suggest that both modern humans and neanderthals lived in europe during this period , which makes it difficult to say for sure which group was the creative talent behind the carvings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend . -lrb- 23 november 2003 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .
shortly after his imprisonment , he was allowed to leave during the day to work . making use of his russian language skills and connections to the former eastern bloc , krenz initially sold elasticized stockings and prostheses to eastern european countries and later helped to export discarded planes to russia , according to the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apartment house near the baltic sea where krenz 's familiy is living , according to news reports .
he was also allowed to spend his annual three-week vacation with his wife and family , who moved to an apartment building -lrb- photo -rrb- in a resort town on germany ’ s baltic sea coastline after a federal court decided krenz had unjustly claimed ownership of his house in berlin .
“ my wife has been waiting 42 years for me to spend more time with her , ” krenz said on thursday .
“ now she ’ ll get that . ” while he plans to stay out of the limelight from now on , krenz said he wants to write his memoirs : “ i will stand up for a just assessment of the gdr . ” dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former east german leader released from jail east germany ’ s last leader was released from prison thursday evening .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .
fossil remains suggest that both modern humans and neanderthals lived in europe during this period , which makes it difficult to say for sure which group was the creative talent behind the carvings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend . -lrb- 23 november 2003 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.12.2003 ireland outlines eu presidency goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spotlight will be on irish prime minister bertie ahern when he takes over the eu presidency on jan .
1 .
following the eu ’ s failure to approve a new constitution and the effective suspension of the bloc ’ s budgetary rules , ireland has decided to take a cautious approach during its six-month presidency starting next year . irish prime minister bertie ahern will have a full plate when he takes over the reins of the european union from his italian counterpart silvio berlusconi on january 1 , 2004 .
italy ’ s eu presidency was marked by discord and strife within the 15 member bloc . in particular , disagreement over the breakdown of crucial talks on the eu ’ s future constitution last weekend and the tattered deficit rules of the euro ’ s stability pact will cast a shadow over the coming months .
add to that the eu ’ s upcoming enlargement in may when 10 countries will join the bloc and ahern will have more than enough to keep him busy . outlining dublin ’ s plans for the eu in the first half of next year , irish foreign minister brian cowen said on thursday ireland would place high priority on tackling the issue of the deadlocked eu constitution talks that pitted germany and france against spain and poland . " we ’ ve had a disagreement .
we ’ ve had a disappointment .
we ’ ve had a setback , " cowen said .
" i have no doubt there will be an agreement .
it ’ s a question of when rather than if . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr valéry giscard d 'estaing , cowen ’ s cautious tone was echoed by valery giscard d ’ estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- , former french president and steward of the eu draft , who for the first on thursday publicly weighed in on the debate over the failed summit .
giscard called the collapse of the summit " a great missed opportunity " and said he did not expect negotiations to resume until late 2004 or early 2005 . " a precipitous move , instead of producing -lrb- agreement -rrb- would probably reinforce antagonisms , so it would be better to have a prudent , cautious approach , " giscard said .
" it would be very unwise to set new deadlines .
things have to be given time to mature , " he added .
giscard also for the first time publicly disclosed that he had favored a higher population threshold for majority voting in eu decision-making , but had been overruled by his peers . eu budget a worry though the constitution is expected to dominate discussions in brussels for the next several months , the irish will also have to deal with the debate on the eu ’ s 2007-2013 budget next month and ensure it does not degenerate into a shouting match between net contributors to the budget and net recipients . the risks have already been heightened with germany and other net contributors suggesting the eu budget needed to be capped , a move that would penalize spain and poland , two big net beneficiaries of eu aid that are blamed for blocking the constitution treaty .
both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .
cowen said on thursday that the existing fiscal rules that limit budget deficits contained enough flexibility and had been appropriately applied on the deficits of germany and france .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

giscard called the collapse of the summit " a great missed opportunity " and said he did not expect negotiations to resume until late 2004 or early 2005 . " a precipitous move , instead of producing -lrb- agreement -rrb- would probably reinforce antagonisms , so it would be better to have a prudent , cautious approach , " giscard said .
" it would be very unwise to set new deadlines .
things have to be given time to mature , " he added .
giscard also for the first time publicly disclosed that he had favored a higher population threshold for majority voting in eu decision-making , but had been overruled by his peers . eu budget a worry though the constitution is expected to dominate discussions in brussels for the next several months , the irish will also have to deal with the debate on the eu ’ s 2007-2013 budget next month and ensure it does not degenerate into a shouting match between net contributors to the budget and net recipients . the risks have already been heightened with germany and other net contributors suggesting the eu budget needed to be capped , a move that would penalize spain and poland , two big net beneficiaries of eu aid that are blamed for blocking the constitution treaty .
both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .
cowen said on thursday that the existing fiscal rules that limit budget deficits contained enough flexibility and had been appropriately applied on the deficits of germany and france .
" of course we all support the application of the rules of the pact , including the excessive deficit procedure , " cowen said .
" in our view , the rules contain an inherent flexibility and it ’ s appropriate that this flexibility be applied with common sense and consistency . " apart from tackling the obvious hurdles ahead , ireland has said its priorities will be to boost economic reform and competition in the eu , job-creation and crime-fighting .
" competition , growth and jobs .
those are the questions , according to which our citizens correctly judge the success of the european project , " cowen said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .

1 .
following the eu ’ s failure to approve a new constitution and the effective suspension of the bloc ’ s budgetary rules , ireland has decided to take a cautious approach during its six-month presidency starting next year . irish prime minister bertie ahern will have a full plate when he takes over the reins of the european union from his italian counterpart silvio berlusconi on january 1 , 2004 .
italy ’ s eu presidency was marked by discord and strife within the 15 member bloc . in particular , disagreement over the breakdown of crucial talks on the eu ’ s future constitution last weekend and the tattered deficit rules of the euro ’ s stability pact will cast a shadow over the coming months .
add to that the eu ’ s upcoming enlargement in may when 10 countries will join the bloc and ahern will have more than enough to keep him busy . outlining dublin ’ s plans for the eu in the first half of next year , irish foreign minister brian cowen said on thursday ireland would place high priority on tackling the issue of the deadlocked eu constitution talks that pitted germany and france against spain and poland . " we ’ ve had a disagreement .
we ’ ve had a disappointment .
we ’ ve had a setback , " cowen said .
" i have no doubt there will be an agreement .
it ’ s a question of when rather than if . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr valéry giscard d 'estaing , cowen ’ s cautious tone was echoed by valery giscard d ’ estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- , former french president and steward of the eu draft , who for the first on thursday publicly weighed in on the debate over the failed summit .
giscard called the collapse of the summit " a great missed opportunity " and said he did not expect negotiations to resume until late 2004 or early 2005 . " a precipitous move , instead of producing -lrb- agreement -rrb- would probably reinforce antagonisms , so it would be better to have a prudent , cautious approach , " giscard said .
" it would be very unwise to set new deadlines .
things have to be given time to mature , " he added .
giscard also for the first time publicly disclosed that he had favored a higher population threshold for majority voting in eu decision-making , but had been overruled by his peers . eu budget a worry though the constitution is expected to dominate discussions in brussels for the next several months , the irish will also have to deal with the debate on the eu ’ s 2007-2013 budget next month and ensure it does not degenerate into a shouting match between net contributors to the budget and net recipients . the risks have already been heightened with germany and other net contributors suggesting the eu budget needed to be capped , a move that would penalize spain and poland , two big net beneficiaries of eu aid that are blamed for blocking the constitution treaty .
both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .
cowen said on thursday that the existing fiscal rules that limit budget deficits contained enough flexibility and had been appropriately applied on the deficits of germany and france .
" of course we all support the application of the rules of the pact , including the excessive deficit procedure , " cowen said .
" in our view , the rules contain an inherent flexibility and it ’ s appropriate that this flexibility be applied with common sense and consistency . " apart from tackling the obvious hurdles ahead , ireland has said its priorities will be to boost economic reform and competition in the eu , job-creation and crime-fighting .
" competition , growth and jobs .
those are the questions , according to which our citizens correctly judge the success of the european project , " cowen said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .

following the eu ’ s failure to approve a new constitution and the effective suspension of the bloc ’ s budgetary rules , ireland has decided to take a cautious approach during its six-month presidency starting next year . irish prime minister bertie ahern will have a full plate when he takes over the reins of the european union from his italian counterpart silvio berlusconi on january 1 , 2004 .

add to that the eu ’ s upcoming enlargement in may when 10 countries will join the bloc and ahern will have more than enough to keep him busy . outlining dublin ’ s plans for the eu in the first half of next year , irish foreign minister brian cowen said on thursday ireland would place high priority on tackling the issue of the deadlocked eu constitution talks that pitted germany and france against spain and poland . " we ’ ve had a disagreement .
we ’ ve had a disappointment .

" i have no doubt there will be an agreement .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr valéry giscard d 'estaing , cowen ’ s cautious tone was echoed by valery giscard d ’ estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- , former french president and steward of the eu draft , who for the first on thursday publicly weighed in on the debate over the failed summit .
giscard called the collapse of the summit " a great missed opportunity " and said he did not expect negotiations to resume until late 2004 or early 2005 . " a precipitous move , instead of producing -lrb- agreement -rrb- would probably reinforce antagonisms , so it would be better to have a prudent , cautious approach , " giscard said .
" it would be very unwise to set new deadlines .
things have to be given time to mature , " he added .

both countries refused to accept the draft that would decrease their voting rights in an enlarged eu . " the problem with non-agreement on the constitution is that more and more issues get fed into the financial perspectives debate , " cowen said in an interview with the financial times . enlargement and euro rules enlargement presents a further challenge to the irish government , as it takes over the running of an eu poised to expand to 450 million people on may 1 , 2004 when 10 new mainly former communist countries join the existing 15 members . ireland is the model of the benefits that eu membership can bring , since the tiny island nation has moved from being a poor net recipient when it joined in1973 , to a thriving , net contributor to the eu budget with some of the highest growth rates in the bloc . another sticking point remains the stability and growth pact that underpins the euro .
cowen said on thursday that the existing fiscal rules that limit budget deficits contained enough flexibility and had been appropriately applied on the deficits of germany and france .
" of course we all support the application of the rules of the pact , including the excessive deficit procedure , " cowen said .
" in our view , the rules contain an inherent flexibility and it ’ s appropriate that this flexibility be applied with common sense and consistency .

following the eu ’ s failure to approve a new constitution and the effective suspension of the bloc ’ s budgetary rules , ireland has decided to take a cautious approach during its six-month presidency starting next year . irish prime minister bertie ahern will have a full plate when he takes over the reins of the european union from his italian counterpart silvio berlusconi on january 1 , 2004 .
italy ’ s eu presidency was marked by discord and strife within the 15 member bloc . in particular , disagreement over the breakdown of crucial talks on the eu ’ s future constitution last weekend and the tattered deficit rules of the euro ’ s stability pact will cast a shadow over the coming months .
add to that the eu ’ s upcoming enlargement in may when 10 countries will join the bloc and ahern will have more than enough to keep him busy . outlining dublin ’ s plans for the eu in the first half of next year , irish foreign minister brian cowen said on thursday ireland would place high priority on tackling the issue of the deadlocked eu constitution talks that pitted germany and france against spain and poland . " we ’ ve had a disagreement .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .

former east german dissidents criticized the early release of east germany ’ s last head of state .
egon krenz was sentenced to six and a half years for his role in the fatal shootings of people trying to flee the country . after a berlin court decided that he was unlikely to become a repeat offender , krenz left prison a free man at 5:30 p.m. on thursday .
“ i ’ ve never felt like a manslaughterer , ” he told a crowd of reporters waiting outside the building in berlin .
“ i ’ ve always viewed it as a defeat that we weren ’ t able to prevent deaths and injuries at the border . ” krenz fought his 1997 conviction on four counts of manslaughter for years and finally began serving his sentence in early 2000 .
upon his release , he remained adamant that he was wrongfully imprisoned . “ it was an unjust trial since i acted as the head of the gdr , a sovereign state , ” said krenz , who held east germany ’ s top position for less than two months in the fall of 1989 . an undeserved freedom ? his sudden release surprised and angered many of those who fought against him and the regime he represented . “ he ’ s now undeservedly enjoying the freedom that he withheld from the citizens of the gdr -lsb- german democratic republic -rsb- , ” said stephan hilsberg , a former east german civil rights activist and now a social democratic member of parliament . wolfgang templin , another gdr dissident , said he believed there was no justification for the release of the 66-year-old , who only served four years of his sentence .
“ krenz has enough of a record and he ’ s neither old nor weak nor seriously ill , ” templin said . krenz benefits from the system he fought others welcomed krenz ’ s release , saying that other gdr leaders who were old and ill , including krenz ’ s predecessor erich honecker -lrb- photo -rrb- , managed to evade long prison sentences .
honecker , whose trial was cancelled for health reasons , died in chilean exile in 1994 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker , left , and egon krenz during the gdr 's heyday . “ i ’ ve always been angered by the fact that nothing happened to those who bore the main responsibility , much more so than krenz did , for the things that happened in the gdr , ” gregor gysi , the former leader of the party of democratic socialism , which emerged out of east german communist party after the fall of the berlin wall , told ard television . he added that the communist leaders in moscow had faced even less scrutiny in the post-cold war era .
“ some of them we made honorary citizens and -lsb- krenz -rsb- we sent to the slammer , ” gysi said .
“ i never found this to be very just . ”
soviet leader michail gorbatchev became an honorary citizen of berlin in 1992 . while agreeing that krenz ’ s release was the right decision , günter nooke , a christian democratic parliamentarian and former gdr dissident , said the communist leader was benefiting from living in a system he had fought for most of his life .
“ as an enemy of the constitutional state he is now enjoying its advantages , ” nooke told ard . from head of state to stockings seller krenz has enjoyed the benefits of the unified germany ’ s prison system for quite some time .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .
a familiy with a household income of € 30,000 will pay about € 568 less in taxes per year . parliamentarians agreed to reduce subsidies for home-owners and commuters to help pay for the tax cut .
they also approved a bill requiring welfare recipients to accept any legal job offered to them or face a cut in benefits , as well as loosening measures protecting workers from getting fired . during the parliamentary debate , the chancellor had tried once more to sway opponents of the reforms .
“ it ’ s better to enter the work force with less protection from getting fired than being excluded with a lot of protection , ” schröder said to applause from members of the opposition . government fails to secure own majority schröder ’ s governing coalition failed to secure a majority for the welfare reforms from its own ranks , however .
prior to the vote , several parliamentarians had already announced that they would vote against measures relating to welfare recipients and protection from getting fired . the voting record by name will not be announced until friday afternoon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber prior to the vote , bavaria ’ s conservative premier edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was the opposition 's chancellor candidate during the 2002 election , said schröder would have to step down if his own coalition did not manage to support the reforms . upper house approve reforms , blocks budget as expected , germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , also approved the reforms .
but in an unrelated matter , the chamber , which is dominated by the opposition christian democrats , rejected germany ’ s 2004 budget as well as a supplementary budget for 2003 , which calls for € 43.4 billion in new debt . the move can only delay adoption of the budget , as the government will be able to pass it with majority in the bundestag .
a spokesman for the ministry of finance called the decision “ irresponsible , ” saying that it would block investments needed for economic recovery in the coming months . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.12.2003 parliament approves sweeping economic reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder failed to secure a majority from his coalition government .
germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .
less taxes , less welfare starting in 2004 , german tax payers will have an additional € 15 billion in their pockets as a € 6.1 billion tax cut had been previously approved .
although the tax cut will take effect in two weeks , many germans might have to wait until april to receive more money as companies will have to adjust their employees ’ tax records .

the artifacts date back between 30,000 and 33,000 years , to a time when some of modern humans ' earliest relatives populated the european continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sculpture of horse 's head the incredible discovery was made during a dig headed by u.s. archeologist and professor at germany 's university of tübingen , nicholas conard .
he believes the figures - at most 5cm high - depicting a lion-man , a water bird and a horse are the oldest examples of human art ever found .
his view is shared by anthony sinclair , an archeologist at the university of liverpool , who told the nature journal that the find were doubtless the oldest corpus of figurative art in the world . conard 's historic find at the hohle fels cave near the city of ulm is not the first of its kind in germany 's donautal region .
this latest discovery brings the total of such finds at four locations in the area to more than 20 . calling the spiritual world it had previously been believed that similar ivory figures of lions and horses discovered in vogelherd in 1939 were the oldest figurative art in the world , but conard is certain that these ones are older because they were uncovered at a lower level in the cave floor sediment .
ever since the discovery last century , archeologists have been pondering the inspiration for the carvings .
some researchers believe the figures are indicative of a respect for the natural world and that early man might have been drawn to the animals depicted because of their power . but the discovery of the water bird has dashed that particular theory and archeologists are now being forced to reconsider the motivation for the miniature sculptures .
conard told nature he believes his historic find is proof that the ancient artists at the four different sites belonged to the same group and shared the same beliefs .
he goes further to suggest that the artifacts are evidence of prehistoric shamanism . bildunterschrift : sculpture of water bird the idea of early shamanism was first mooted by renowned south african archeologist , david lewis-williams .
he believes that in primitive societies people in need of help would contact the spirit world through shamans , who had the unique ability to enter a trance and solve problems from the ' other side ' .
conard says that early cultures might have viewed diving water birds as creatures which could move between the real world and the spirit world and described the finding at hohle fels as " the icing on the cake " for supporters of lewis-williams ' theory . the fine art of prehistoric sculpture whatever the meaning behind the little carvings , there 's no doubt that they are too intricate to fit with existing theories about the gradual evolution of art , which suggest it began in bluntly and has become honed to sophistication over the course of thousands and thousands of years . conard , who has studied human migration from africa at dig sites from syria to germany , believes that humans first arrived in central europe by following the river danube west into the area .
fossil remains suggest that both modern humans and neanderthals lived in europe during this period , which makes it difficult to say for sure which group was the creative talent behind the carvings . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neanderthal man gets new home the cultural history of the rhine river region is the focus of a reconceived museum that opens in bonn this weekend . -lrb- 23 november 2003 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s two chambers of parliament overwhelmingly approved a € 8.9 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- tax cut and welfare reforms on friday .
chancellor gerhard schröder called the reforms “ a signal that germany is moving ahead . ” while the reform package received overwhelming support across party lines , opposition leaders said the reforms did not go far enough to cure the country ’ s ailing economy . “ the boiler remains under pressure , ” guido westerwelle , the leader of the business-oriented free democrats said before the vote .
“ this is a good start , but it ’ s not much more than that .
it ’ s a reform trail at best , but this country needs a reform road . ” top opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union , agreed .
“ today can not hide the fact that the real reforms still lie ahead , ” merkel said .

after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life . darmstadt , germany - for europe ’ s first mission to mars , the atmosphere at the european space agency ’ s answer to mission control was surprisingly calm friday morning .
a handful of engineers pondered data on the screens of their computers as a stuffed beagle mascot watched over what could easily have become a tension-riddled morning .
for nearly two hours , when the european space operations center lost contact with mars express , as planned , scientists huddled quietly in corners , eyes glancing nervously at watches .
" it was a strange feeling with nothing to do - just sit and wait and hope that everything goes right , " said john reddy , principal electrical systems engineer and one of the many scientists manning the computer terminals . then , just after noon , the calm scene erupted into one of elation as the first data made the 8.21-minute journey back to earth signaling the successful separation of esa ’ s mars probe from its mother ship .
with the maneuver behind it , mars express entered the final leg of its journey to the red planet , where it will search for water and signs of life , both present and past .
" we can confirm that we have beagle 2 separation , " said mike mckay , the mission ’ s flight director .
the separation , which involved sending 115 separate commands to the spacecraft , marks the start of the probe ’ s six-day descent to mars , which will culminate with a dramatic entry into the martian atmosphere during the wee hours of christmas morning .
" it ’ s on its way to mars .
it ’ s been a very tense morning and now we have an enormous sense of relief , " said esa director of science david southwood .
" this is a big step towards getting to mars .
we have to wait now till christmas day for the next step ... i ’ m confident mother and baby are very well .
let ’ s see how the family does . "
the separation is the final chapter in a 400-million-kilometer , six-month journey that has been challenged by solar flares that , at one point , threw the mars express off course , and problems with the on-board solar panels .
on friday those minor glitches faded as mission control popped open the champagne and celebrated it ’ s first taste of victory .
the aim of the mars express mission is to detect whether water ever existed beneath the planet ’ s surface .
" we ’ re going to mars to find out more about our neighbor planet , " said southwood .
" mars is the only planet that could have supported the kind of life we know .
as for now , we don ’ t think it supports life .
that should worry people .
why ?
what went wrong ?
why doesn ’ t it have life .
and could it have -lrb- life -rrb- in the future ? "
if water did ever exist on mars , southwood said , esa scientists want to find out what made it disappear .
" there are signs there was water , but where is it now ?
we ’ ll be looking at the atmosphere leading -lrb- from mars -rrb- into space .
did circumstances lead to water being lost .
where did it go – under the surface or was it removed into the atmosphere and into space ?
we ’ re looking to see what process could have led to this . "
the mission ’ s two major vessels – the mars express orbiter and the beagle 2 probe – have both been outfitted with state-of-the-art gadgets designed to answer those questions .
the orbiter , which will circle mars for two years , includes a ground-penetrating radar that can scan several kilometers beneath the martian surface in its search for water .
the 65-kilogram beagle 2 lander , named after the ship charles darwin sailed to the galapagos islands in 1831 , will comb the surface of mars , " scratching and sniffing " like its namesake dog to search for signs of life .
the british-made lander is equipped with two cameras , microscopes , rock grinders , cameras , x-ray spectrometers , a paw that can dig beneath rocks and a mini laboratory for on board analysis .
" it will tell the history of the rocks , " said southwood .
but before the groundwork can begin , beagle has to overcome one more hurdle that two-thirds of previous mars missions have failed to do : make it safely to the planet ’ s surface .
once it enters into the martian atmosphere , friction is expected to slow the beagle ’ s descent from about 20,000 kilometers per hour to 1,600 .
at that point parachutes will be deployed , the heat shield ejected and gas-filled airbags will engulf the lander , enabling it to repeatedly bounce as high as 30 meters until it makes a safe landing on mars .
esa scientists have pin-pointed the landing area to a small ellipses measuring 31.8 by 5.1 kilometers located at isidis planitia on mars ’ northern hemisphere , a relatively rockless and flat sedimentary basin that provides the most optimal landing conditions .
if all goes well after landing , the beagle will pop open , unfurling its scientific instruments and solar panels that will be used to power them .
it will also play a short song penned by the british pop group blur to signal success .
and back in darmstadt , esa officials will declare that " the beagle has landed . "
the € 300 million mission marks the european space agency ’ s first interplanetary mission .
esa officials hope to use the mission to generate widespread interest in space exploration .
" it ’ s not the little green men we ’ re looking for , " said esa ’ s southwood , " but mineral material .
we ’ re doing the detective story by looking for clues , not by finding a dead or live body in the library .

the country 's police forces have been set the task of reducing serious and violent crime by 5 % by next april .
but in the 12-month period to april this year , serious and violent crime increased by 8 % , making the task of meeting the target more challenging .
however , the accounts commission for scotland said the forces were on course to beat other performance targets .
the number of people killed or injured in accidents is falling , housebreakings are down and the number of drug seizures has increased .
drug seizures the clear-up rate for all recorded crime is 46.6 % , the highest since 1996 .
accounts commission chairman alastair macnish said : " these latest figures are encouraging and reflect real efforts on the part of scotland 's police forces to bring crime levels down .
" their achievements in areas such as increasing the number of drug seizures and reducing the number of housebreakings are important , and need to be recognised .
we need to learn the lessons from others and put more police officers on our streets annabel goldie deputy tory leader " however , the figures imply scope for improvement in reducing the number of serious violent crimes . "
serious and violent crime includes murder , rape , robbery and serious injury assaults .

the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents fell by 29 % , compared to a target reduction of 18 % , and the number of children killed or injured saw an even bigger fall .
recorded crimes deputy tory leader annabel goldie said the statistics highlighted growing concerns over violent crime .
she urged the scottish executive to look to new york for solutions .
" there is one police officer for every seven recorded crimes in new york , and one police officer for every 27 recorded crimes in scotland , " she said .
we are committed to working with the police to prevent and punish violent behaviour and the impact it has on our communities cathy jamieson justice minister " we need to learn the lessons from others and put more police officers on our streets . "
justice minister cathy jamieson said : " this is an issue that the executive and the police take very seriously .
" we are committed to working with the police to prevent and punish violent behaviour and the impact it has on our communities . "
the minister said she was encouraged by the reduction in tayside and said she would work with police chiefs to see if lessons could be learned for the rest of the country .
she added that proposed reforms to licensing laws would help reduce the " potentially fatal connection " between alcohol and violent crime .

the case is due back in court on january 9 when it is hoped to set a date for the appeal hearing towards the end of the month .
' green light ' dutch developers am had hoped to begin work on the flagship retail and leisure complex early in the new year , but the legal action could mean a delay .

former direct rule minister des browne had said work could start immediately on the regeneration of the 15 acre site .
the proposals for the development were first put forward four years ago .

but uk coal said a further £ 10m for three other pits was still being reviewed because mining plans were being re-examined .
the government aid , aimed at helping the uk coal industry to survive , makes up 30 % of the cost of a development project undertaken by the uk 's biggest coal producer .
aid has been accepted at kellingley in west yorkshire ; maltby in south yorkshire ; thoresby in nottinghamshire ; daw mill , near coventry and harworth , north nottinghamshire .
kellingley colliery , near pontefract , has been given £ 7.2m of the money to open up new seams hundreds of metres below ground .
the money will allow uk coal to lay around 20,000 metres of underground railways to gain access to 10 million tonnes of coal reserves .
the company was hoping to get £ 14m but say the windfall will give the pit a stable future .
the three collieries where aid is still being reviewed are ellington , northumberland ; rossington in south yorkshire ; and welbeck in nottinghamshire .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- randall : what to expect in 2004 home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 19 december , 2003 , 08:03 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version randall : what to expect in 2004 by jeff randall bbc business editor a favourite trick of journalists at this time of year is to ask a few celebrities to make some predictions for the coming year and then hold them up for ridicule 12 months later when none comes true .
but here at the bbc , we champion balance and fairness , so in the spirit of the festive season these are the business editor 's half dozen predictions for 2004 .
i will , of course , expect no mercy from cynical readers when my crystal ball proves even less reliable than the bbc 's power supply .
1 .
telegraph battle forget eastenders and the archers , soap opera of the year will be the battle for control of telegraph newspapers , as lord black 's problems deepen at hollinger .
titles of such prestige and commercial value come on the market once in a blue moon , so the bidding is expected to be hot .
the daily express 's owner , richard desmond , though dogged by his reputation as a pornographer , is in pole position .
he already owns half of westferry , the printing operation that produces the telegraph , and if the newspaper changes hands he holds pre-emption rights on the other 50 % .
for other would-be bidders for the telegraph , mr desmond 's contract represents a highly toxic " poison pill " .
2 .
debt trouble rising debt , both individual and governmental , will increasingly undermine economic confidence .
british consumers are living in a never-never land of very high personal borrowings .
they simply can not carry on spending more than they are earning without a hard landing .
barclays bank 's cautious and conservative approach to further consumer lending will be proven correct .
by contrast , royal bank of scotland , which continues to be more aggressive , will start to encounter rising problems with delinquent borrowers .
the chancellor has recently been forced to readjust sharply his own borrowing figures , as government spending , especially on health and education , outstrips tax revenues .
some city economists calculate that gordon brown 's forecast of £ 31bn for next year is too optimistic and that £ 37bn is more likely .
3 .
us economy george bush , despite suffering a serious wobble in recent polls , will be returned to the white house .
the capture of saddam hussein will prove to be an enormous boost for the hawks in us government .
america 's economy has returned to strong growth , and the sharp fall in the dollar will help us exporters .
but not all american companies will enjoy the fruits of recovery .
ford in particular will continue to suffer as bill ford struggles in vain to rejuvenate the business that bears his family name .
4 .
stagnant stocks having enjoyed growth of about 10 % since the start of this year , the uk stock market will drift sideways in 2004 .
those forecasting a quick return to the bull market of the late 1990s will be confounded .
london 's ftse 100 index peaked at 6,900 at the turn of the millennium .
it would take another five years of 10 % compound annual growth for that level to be surpassed .
highly unlikely .
my prediction is that we 'll not see a new peak for at least 10 years .
5 .
bankrupt football clubs an english premier league football club will go into administration .
while plenty of clubs in england and scotland are already operating under administrators , a top-flight club has yet to fail .
but such now are the money pressures on some of the financially weaker teams , it is only a matter of time before a big name goes under .
football 's debts accumulated in the go-go years of the late 1990s , when some clubs foolishly thought they could replicate manchester united 's highly successful business model , combined with the game 's dearth of high-quality commercial managers is a corporate accident waiting to happen .
6 .
guinness cheer the greatest number of pints of guinness ever sold at a single event will take place on wednesday 17 march .
why ?
because in 2004 , st patrick 's day happens to fall bang in the middle of the cheltenham national hunt festival , the pinnacle of the jump racing season .
cheltenham houses a massive guinness enclosure that even on a normal day , if such a thing exists at the festival , pours out gallons of the black stuff to thirsty race goers .
this year 's celebrations for an irish winner promise to be wilder than ever .

the chancellor has recently been forced to readjust sharply his own borrowing figures , as government spending , especially on health and education , outstrips tax revenues .
some city economists calculate that gordon brown 's forecast of £ 31bn for next year is too optimistic and that £ 37bn is more likely .
3 .
us economy george bush , despite suffering a serious wobble in recent polls , will be returned to the white house .
the capture of saddam hussein will prove to be an enormous boost for the hawks in us government .
america 's economy has returned to strong growth , and the sharp fall in the dollar will help us exporters .

4 .
stagnant stocks having enjoyed growth of about 10 % since the start of this year , the uk stock market will drift sideways in 2004 .
those forecasting a quick return to the bull market of the late 1990s will be confounded .
london 's ftse 100 index peaked at 6,900 at the turn of the millennium .

bankrupt football clubs an english premier league football club will go into administration .
while plenty of clubs in england and scotland are already operating under administrators , a top-flight club has yet to fail .
but such now are the money pressures on some of the financially weaker teams , it is only a matter of time before a big name goes under .
football 's debts accumulated in the go-go years of the late 1990s , when some clubs foolishly thought they could replicate manchester united 's highly successful business model , combined with the game 's dearth of high-quality commercial managers is a corporate accident waiting to happen .

guinness cheer the greatest number of pints of guinness ever sold at a single event will take place on wednesday 17 march .
why ?

cheltenham houses a massive guinness enclosure that even on a normal day , if such a thing exists at the festival , pours out gallons of the black stuff to thirsty race goers .
this year 's celebrations for an irish winner promise to be wilder than ever .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- randall : what to expect in 2004 bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies friday , 19 december , 2003 , 08:03 gmt randall : what to expect in 2004 by jeff randall bbc business editor a favourite trick of journalists at this time of year is to ask a few celebrities to make some predictions for the coming year and then hold them up for ridicule 12 months later when none comes true .
but here at the bbc , we champion balance and fairness , so in the spirit of the festive season these are the business editor 's half dozen predictions for 2004 .
i will , of course , expect no mercy from cynical readers when my crystal ball proves even less reliable than the bbc 's power supply .
1 .
telegraph battle forget eastenders and the archers , soap opera of the year will be the battle for control of telegraph newspapers , as lord black 's problems deepen at hollinger .
titles of such prestige and commercial value come on the market once in a blue moon , so the bidding is expected to be hot .
the daily express 's owner , richard desmond , though dogged by his reputation as a pornographer , is in pole position .
he already owns half of westferry , the printing operation that produces the telegraph , and if the newspaper changes hands he holds pre-emption rights on the other 50 % .
for other would-be bidders for the telegraph , mr desmond 's contract represents a highly toxic " poison pill " .
2 .
debt trouble rising debt , both individual and governmental , will increasingly undermine economic confidence .
british consumers are living in a never-never land of very high personal borrowings .
they simply can not carry on spending more than they are earning without a hard landing .
barclays bank 's cautious and conservative approach to further consumer lending will be proven correct .
by contrast , royal bank of scotland , which continues to be more aggressive , will start to encounter rising problems with delinquent borrowers .
the chancellor has recently been forced to readjust sharply his own borrowing figures , as government spending , especially on health and education , outstrips tax revenues .

having previously brushed off calls from refugee groups to intervene in the protest , immigration minister amanda vanstone said on friday that the government would send two representatives to the pacific island of nauru early next week to speak to the protesters .
as the hunger strike entered its ninth day , the immigration department said that 35 men were now refusing food , and at least 15 have been taken to hospital .
australia has one of the world 's strictest immigration policies , detaining all asylum seekers without visas in high-security camps .
ms vanstone said former immigration minister john hodges and afghan community leader gholam aboss would visit nauru to investigate the plight of the hunger strikers and to try to find a solution .
but she added that all had had their asylum claims heard and were found " not to be refugees " .
on wednesday , ms vanstone had said that because the refugees were not on australian territory , they were not canberra 's responsibility .
and she said that if they did not like it in the nauru centre they could go home .
canberra set up detention centres on nauru and papua new guinea in 2001 , and deployed its navy to divert all boats carrying asylum seekers to australia to those camps .
thirty-four of the protesters are from afghanistan and one is from pakistan .
australia 's second offshore detention centre for would-be immigrants , in papua new guinea , was closed in july .
the country has five centres within its own borders .
those housed in offshore camps are denied appeal rights in australian courts if their asylum applications are refused .
there have been a string of hunger strikes and protests in australia 's detention camps , which together house about 1,200 people .

then , inch by creaking inch , she yielded to the massive floating crane brought in to lift her clear .
within half an hour she had completed her final journey from quayside to scrap yard , taking her place alongside the five other scottish vessels awaiting the attentions of the wrecking crews .
the uberous is lifted into the yard paul stewart watched the operation glumly , his mood matching the grim december drizzle scudding across the danish port of grenaa .
he gestured towards a red rusting hulk , the norlantean from stromness in orkney , and to the buckie boat , the altair and said : " i know the guys who used to skipper these vessels .
it 's heartbreaking to see them end up here . "
soon his own boat , the poseidon , will join them .
for this is where scottish fishing vessels have come to die .
the european union calls the process decommissioning - taking vessels out of the fleet to reduce the number catching fish and so preserve the rapidly dwindling stocks .
paul stewart says it 's more like bereavement : " i 'm going to a friend 's funeral .
this vessel is my life 's work , now it 's going to be cut up .
the boat 's nine years old but there 's still 20 or 30 years ' life left in her and yet she 's going to be ripped to pieces and melted down .
this is just a waste of money - it does n't make sense . "
the decision to give up the job he 's been doing since he was 16 was not his .
like others he was forced to seek decommissioning by the bank which loaned him the money to buy his boat but then decided his business was no longer viable .
the remains of the bounteous sea lie on the ground the hundreds of thousands of pounds paul will receive from the government plus the proceeds of the sale of the poseidon to the danish ship breakers will all go towards paying off some of his sizeable debts .
he says most fishermen accept the need for european governments to limit the amount of fish caught , but he feels decommissioning is killing the industry .
by early in the new year , almost 30 scottish trawlers will have been scrapped at the grenaa yard .
last year , double that number was destroyed .
in the main white fish ports of fraserburgh and peterhead the results of decommissioning are obvious : the size of the fleet has been halved .
from 2004 , just 125 vessels will be chasing the cod , haddock and whiting in the north sea and beyond .
fishing capacity will be reduced by a third .
in denmark , they 've seen it all before .
the ship-breaking firm which is buying up the scottish boats was started by two fishermen who went through the same painful process at the beginning of the nineties .
' totally crazy ' now they make their money by selling on the wheel houses , engines , winches and other equipment salvaged from the vessels they decommission .
but even they despair when they see some of the boats they have to reduce to scrap .
" to scrap a 30-year-old boat , that 's okay , " says egun dam , " it 's done its job .
but a three-year-old boat ?
that 's criminal .
she could be used somewhere else in the world .
the system is totally crazy . "
the party of thai fishermen we stumbled across in grenaa agreed .
they were scouring the yard for equipment they could use to update their own less modern fleet .
they would have preferred to buy whole vessels but the eu insists that the hulls of decommissioned fishing boats must be completely destroyed .
paul stewart considers a bleak future for the industry this is why the likes of the uberous end up at the scrap yard .
once ashore , their hulls are attacked by machines which tear and rip them apart .
nothing is spared .
in the space of two days , a 120-tonne vessel simply disappears to be replaced by a small mountain of scrap metal and trash .
for british fisheries ministers , scientists and environmentalists every boat that 's scrapped represents a small step forward in the fight to save fish stocks , but for the skippers who used to own them the future is uncertain .
some will work on at sea as crew on other trawlers .
some will simply retire .
others , like paul stewart , will try to learn new skills to get a job away from the sea .
as we watched the decommissioning process in denmark last week , i wondered out loud what became of the piles of metal fragments formed from the destruction of scottish fishing boats .
" they are recycled , " came the swift reply from one of the wrecking crews .
" they go to be smelted down for the german car industry . "
paul stewart was not impressed .

paul stewart says it 's more like bereavement : " i 'm going to a friend 's funeral .
this vessel is my life 's work , now it 's going to be cut up .
the boat 's nine years old but there 's still 20 or 30 years ' life left in her and yet she 's going to be ripped to pieces and melted down .
this is just a waste of money - it does n't make sense . "
the decision to give up the job he 's been doing since he was 16 was not his .
like others he was forced to seek decommissioning by the bank which loaned him the money to buy his boat but then decided his business was no longer viable .
the remains of the bounteous sea lie on the ground the hundreds of thousands of pounds paul will receive from the government plus the proceeds of the sale of the poseidon to the danish ship breakers will all go towards paying off some of his sizeable debts .
he says most fishermen accept the need for european governments to limit the amount of fish caught , but he feels decommissioning is killing the industry .
by early in the new year , almost 30 scottish trawlers will have been scrapped at the grenaa yard .
last year , double that number was destroyed .
in the main white fish ports of fraserburgh and peterhead the results of decommissioning are obvious : the size of the fleet has been halved .
from 2004 , just 125 vessels will be chasing the cod , haddock and whiting in the north sea and beyond .
fishing capacity will be reduced by a third .
in denmark , they 've seen it all before .
the ship-breaking firm which is buying up the scottish boats was started by two fishermen who went through the same painful process at the beginning of the nineties .
' totally crazy ' now they make their money by selling on the wheel houses , engines , winches and other equipment salvaged from the vessels they decommission .
but even they despair when they see some of the boats they have to reduce to scrap .
" to scrap a 30-year-old boat , that 's okay , " says egun dam , " it 's done its job .
but a three-year-old boat ?
that 's criminal .
she could be used somewhere else in the world .
the system is totally crazy . "
the party of thai fishermen we stumbled across in grenaa agreed .
they were scouring the yard for equipment they could use to update their own less modern fleet .
they would have preferred to buy whole vessels but the eu insists that the hulls of decommissioned fishing boats must be completely destroyed .
paul stewart considers a bleak future for the industry this is why the likes of the uberous end up at the scrap yard .
once ashore , their hulls are attacked by machines which tear and rip them apart .
nothing is spared .
in the space of two days , a 120-tonne vessel simply disappears to be replaced by a small mountain of scrap metal and trash .
for british fisheries ministers , scientists and environmentalists every boat that 's scrapped represents a small step forward in the fight to save fish stocks , but for the skippers who used to own them the future is uncertain .
some will work on at sea as crew on other trawlers .
some will simply retire .
others , like paul stewart , will try to learn new skills to get a job away from the sea .
as we watched the decommissioning process in denmark last week , i wondered out loud what became of the piles of metal fragments formed from the destruction of scottish fishing boats .
" they are recycled , " came the swift reply from one of the wrecking crews .
" they go to be smelted down for the german car industry . "
paul stewart was not impressed .

a tree will be planted for every tonne of aluminium collected until next june by six local authorities in oxfordshire .
the recycling company alupro expects to plant more than 35,000 trees in parks , woods and private gardens in return for cans , tin foil and other aluminium waste .
county councillor anne purse said : " any organisation that recycles over a tonne of aluminium cans and foil within the year can collect a tree .
" the trees can then either be planted locally or they can be donated to the woodland trust , which will then organise the planting .
" it is such a great idea to encourage people to recycle . "

lord hutton 's report into the death of government scientist david kelly , found dead days after attending a commons committee , is expected in the new year .
mr dyke told the times newspaper " no-one can be confident " there would be no resignations until the report was seen .
he added : " i do n't think there will be that but you ca n't be sure . "
mr dyke said the first question would be " whether we agree with the findings " .
' some failures ' the bbc and the government clashed publicly when the corporation refused to identify the source of a story on radio 4 's today programme that the government " sexed up " a dossier on the threat from iraq .
andrew gilligan , the reporter behind the story , also wrote in the mail on sunday that his source had named the prime minister 's former director of communications , alastair campbell , as the person behind the alleged " sexing up " of the dossier .
mr dyke said the bbc had already admitted it had made mistakes in its handling of the row with the government , especially with mr campbell , who hit back at mr gilligan 's comments .
the broadcaster admitted dr kelly was the source behind the story after he was found dead .

but are ordinary argentines feeling the benefit ?
on a wednesday night , the dandy tango bar in the buenos aires suburb of san telmo is packed with ageing aficionados of argentina 's most popular dance .
from the ornate chandeliers to the gramophone sitting on a wooden cabinet , everything here appears to have been plucked from a bygone era : namely the 1930s , when argentina 's wealth rivalled that of france .
today , argentina is not even as wealthy as neighbouring chile .
smart footwork but for people like lina acuña - who runs a small guesthouse for tango tourists - the economic crisis has been a boon .
two months before it struck , lina 's ex-husband , a keen watcher of the economy , warned her to withdraw her money from the bank to protect her savings .
she followed his advice and took her money out in dollars .
when the peso was devalued - after being pegged at one-to-one with the dollar since march 1991 - guest house owner lina found herself significantly wealthier than before .
" i had six months worth of reservations , in dollars , " she recalls .
lina was lucky to take her cash out of the bank before the crash " so for me it was very good , because the exchange rate went from one-to-one to one-to-3.5 , but prices did n't rise .
they only went up a little , so i could buy three-and-a-half times as much . "
lina was lucky , for when the economy crashed the government imposed restrictions on bank withdrawals .
crisis furious middle class savers took to the streets on 19 december 2001 , banging casserole dishes to show the government they had no food .
a day later , the protests turned violent .
the police moved in and 25 people were killed .

within a few weeks , three more presidents came and went .
argentina defaulted on its debts - the largest default in history - and the peso was devalued .
there are now roughly three pesos to the dollar .
struggling to survive melisa raddi is just one of millions of middle class argentines who now struggle to make ends meet .
the 22-year-old has repeatedly postponed her studies in order to help support her mother , nora .
melisa works as the personal assistant to the director of a loan company serving people who have trouble getting credit with the banks .
it is a growth area following the crisis .
despite working for a loan company melisa is struggling herself working from 10 hours a day , five days a week , melisa earns 500 pesos -lrb- $ 165 -rrb- a month .
after payments on her mother 's debt from a previous flat , and a loan she had to take out to make sure they were not thrown out of their current home , melisa is left with just 40 pesos -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- a month .
" we were never a rich family or anything like that , " she says .
" but we were a family that could live normally , that could eat , that could clothe itself , that could do what it needed to do and that could give itself the luxury of falling ill and being able to buy medicine .
nowadays we 're in a mess . "
but not in as much of a mess as 19 million argentines - half the population - who live below the poverty line .
a few blocks away from melisa 's office in central buenos aires a group of men seize bags of rubbish from a dump-truck while the bin-man 's back is turned .
they run across the main road , throw their booty on the ground and begin furiously tearing at the bags like a pack of hyenas , in the hope of finding something edible .

although the economy is improving , poorer argentines still suffer " " things are pretty bad , but what has changed is the perception going forward .

jp morgan chase expects argentina 's economy to expand by 7 % this year , and 6 % in 2004 .

these disparate groups of poor , unemployed or retired people gather most days of the week in central buenos aires , to vent their anger at the government .
