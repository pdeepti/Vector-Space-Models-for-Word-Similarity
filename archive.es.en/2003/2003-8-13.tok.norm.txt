a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .

20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .
" it ’ ll definitely be better the next time , " she added .
but nobody in grimma hopes there will be a next time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans , czechs prevent next big flood a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .

radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .

the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .

for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo used to sing in german , now he mixes in english lyrics .
the decision by the government and the music industry in germany can be seen as a direct response to the failings of the public radio sector in fulfilling its cultural duty .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .
" it ’ ll definitely be better the next time , " she added .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .
" it ’ ll definitely be better the next time , " she added .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo used to sing in german , now he mixes in english lyrics .
the decision by the government and the music industry in germany can be seen as a direct response to the failings of the public radio sector in fulfilling its cultural duty .
artists such as xavier naidoo and herbert grönemeyer consistently release material in the native language but the trend of german performers to push for a market further afield and release the bulk of their output in english has , for a long time , been supported by more and more radio programs .
bid to build stronger cultural identity the german music industry continues to develop a wide variety of music in difficult circumstances that is not presented at all on the radio .
the quota is designed to bring those who sing in their german mother tongue to a wider audience and help build a stronger musical and cultural identity in germany . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

"
hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

schröder will be visiting the famous verona music festival on the invitation of eu commission president romano prodi .
last month berlusconi antagonized the germans when he likened a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard .
relations soured further after a junior italian minister made disparaging comments about german tourists , following which schröder canceled his summer vacation to italy .
but in a sign that ties may be improving , berlusconi recently told an italian tabloid , " i almost feel like a german , " while schröder told italian journalists at the locarno film festival , " i love italy , yes , it is love .
i ’ m completely fascinated by your country .

radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .

the decision by the government and the music industry in germany can be seen as a direct response to the failings of the public radio sector in fulfilling its cultural duty .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .

about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .

about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .
" it ’ ll definitely be better the next time , " she added .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .

about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .

" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .

financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .

at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo used to sing in german , now he mixes in english lyrics .
the decision by the government and the music industry in germany can be seen as a direct response to the failings of the public radio sector in fulfilling its cultural duty .
artists such as xavier naidoo and herbert grönemeyer consistently release material in the native language but the trend of german performers to push for a market further afield and release the bulk of their output in english has , for a long time , been supported by more and more radio programs .
bid to build stronger cultural identity the german music industry continues to develop a wide variety of music in difficult circumstances that is not presented at all on the radio .
the quota is designed to bring those who sing in their german mother tongue to a wider audience and help build a stronger musical and cultural identity in germany . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo used to sing in german , now he mixes in english lyrics .
the decision by the government and the music industry in germany can be seen as a direct response to the failings of the public radio sector in fulfilling its cultural duty .
artists such as xavier naidoo and herbert grönemeyer consistently release material in the native language but the trend of german performers to push for a market further afield and release the bulk of their output in english has , for a long time , been supported by more and more radio programs .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .

the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .

the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo used to sing in german , now he mixes in english lyrics .
the decision by the government and the music industry in germany can be seen as a direct response to the failings of the public radio sector in fulfilling its cultural duty .
artists such as xavier naidoo and herbert grönemeyer consistently release material in the native language but the trend of german performers to push for a market further afield and release the bulk of their output in english has , for a long time , been supported by more and more radio programs .
bid to build stronger cultural identity the german music industry continues to develop a wide variety of music in difficult circumstances that is not presented at all on the radio .
the quota is designed to bring those who sing in their german mother tongue to a wider audience and help build a stronger musical and cultural identity in germany . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .

it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .

about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .

some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .

20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .
" it ’ ll definitely be better the next time , " she added .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .

authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .
" it ’ ll definitely be better the next time , " she added .
but nobody in grimma hopes there will be a next time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans , czechs prevent next big flood a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .

hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .

nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .

radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .

the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .

"
hans eichel ponders his latest budget headache the german cabinet on wednesday will decide whether to close a number of tax loopholes that cost the government billions of euros a year .
but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .
if germany does not lower its deficit by next year – it 's expected to hit 3.6 percent of gdp in 2003 – the country could likely face sanctions from the eu . drowning in debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff .
“ eichel ’ s plans are unacceptable .
it ’ s an attempt by a drowning man to pull others down with him , ” said christian wulff , the premier of the state of lower saxony . adding to the finance minister ’ s woes , the opposition has taken aim at his method of financing tax cuts that would lower income taxes for many germans by up to ten percent starting next year . besides ending tax allowances for home owners and commuters , self-employed professions such as doctors , lawyers and accountants are also likely to be required to pay some new form of corporate taxes to help increase municipal tax revenue . “ the principal of in-the-left-pocket , out-the-right-pocket is no signal for -lrb- economic -rrb- recovery , ” said deputy parliamentary leader of the liberal free democrats carl-ludwig thiele . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stoiber attacks schröder on tax reform two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy .

but the measures may not pass the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament . amid meager growth and a ballooning budget deficit , german finance minister hans eichel has had to put his red pen to extra use these days .
for the 2004 budget , cutting spending has become a top priority as has closing a number of popular , yet expensive tax loopholes . according to some reports in the media , by getting rid of tax allowances for home owners , commuters and others , eichel hopes to bring in an extra € 10 billion each year to the government ’ s coffers beginning in 2005 . citing a letter from the finance minister to chancellor gerhard schröder , the financial times deutschland said on tuesday that the measures would net at least € 5 billion in revenue starting next year at the expense of those firms and individuals who previously benefited from the loopholes . giving back to the people but a spokesman for the finance ministry disputed that closing tax loopholes would amount to a “ burden ” on taxpayers .
he said that such allowances amounted to taxpayer-supported subsidies and that ending them would give the government “ the chance to give the funds back to the citizens . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat building in berlin .
since many of germany ’ s cities and municipalities are broke , one might be forgiven for thinking anything that might fill federal and state treasuries with more tax revenue would fly through the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament that represents germany ’ s federal states .
but the conservative opposition , which currently controls the bundesrat , has instead already announced it would fight many of the measures schröder ’ s cabinet is likely to approve on wednesday . on one side there are those regional leaders who feel the federal government is not doing enough to help increase municipal tax revenues for small towns and cities .
on the other are those conservative state politicians who disagree with how the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens are planning on financing tax cuts that are being brought forward a year to help spark economic growth . attempting to narrow the divide one of the most controversial points in the draft budget legislation is eichel ’ s intention to rebalance the country ’ s “ stability pact ” that divides up the total national debt allowance between state and federal authorities .
since the federal government intends to cover some of the responsibilities of the impoverished states and municipalities , he wants to change the ratio from 55 to 45 percent in favor of the states to allowing both sides equally borrow the same amount . the federal-state debt ratio is important because germany continues to breach european union deficit spending rules that require euro-zone members to keep their budget deficit under three percent of gross domestic product .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.08.2003 sing it loud , proud and in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert grönemeyer is one of the few who gets radio play for his german songs the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy . it used to be the cultural mandate of public radio stations to promote new music and to support the music industry in its own country .
radio dj 's were known as ' hit makers ' for that very reason in the days before repeatedly regurgitated and commercially profitable playlists were forced upon them .
now , by delivering a repetitive selection of songs chosen because of their popularity with the listeners and the all-important audience figures , the ' hit makers ' have become mere ' hit players ' .
it now seems that the promotion of new music is secondary to the constant flow of successful songs , and the primary aim of the programs is to prevent the radio from being switched off between commercial breaks .
when ' popular ' music means those songs which have been successful with audiences for the last few years and manufactured pop hits sold on the back of some television program or commercial , then the music industry is left with two unhealthy extremes : the old favorites on one side , the immediate throwaway hits of today on the other .
left withering in the middle is the diminishing support structure for new music .
only 6 percent of radio time for german pop in countries where the native language is n't english , this problem has been magnified .
in germany in 2001 , there were only 11 german productions among the top 100 airplay charts with the first german-language song ranked at a lowly 163 .
in that year , only six percent of radio airtime in germany was dedicated to german-language rock and pop songs once the oldies and folk music were deducted .
this meant that only every 17th broadcast title was a song sung in german - amounting to less than one per hour .
a study carried out by former minister of state for culture , julian nida-rümelin , over a period between may 2001 and april 2002 showed that the use of german-produced material on the radio was between 10 and 20 percent of all airplay , while german language titles remained below ten percent .
of the 94 programs surveyed , only 51 managed to reach a five percent share of german language titles .
bildunterschrift : no angels are german but make hits in english .
the figures for 2002 and 2003 may show a slight improvement on this considering the influx of german soap stars who have released records and the popularity of shows such as popstars , pop idol and germany 's search for a superstar - oh , but wait !
nearly all of them sing in english , do n't they ? 50:50 aims to save german music the german government and the german music industry have proposed to take the matter in hand in a belated bid to save native talent .
the 50:50 radio quota states that every second title played should be a new song which is no older than three months .
the artist should not have published more than two albums so far , none of which has yet reached ' gold ' status .
but the most important part of the quota proposal states that every second new title is to be in german .
and this is what gives the initiative its name : 50 percent of radio play should be new songs and 50 percent of those should be in german .
this should increase the paltry six percent of german rock and pop being played on public radio to at least 25 percent .
the quota is also designed to give new music a fair chance of being listened to , and possibly also being bought in the shops .
as an upswing , the initiative may ultimately provide more innovative music which will find new listeners for the radio stations and win back the old ones .
it is a model that has been used to great effect in france .
the radio quota there has been in operation for nearly ten years now .
instead of a fixed ratio , as in the german proposal , the french promote a percentage of new and french-language titles according to the type of radio program : the fewer the number of french titles suitable in the program 's repertoire , the greater the number of new titles and vice versa .
french model a success the french model has also shown that the long held belief that ' successful hits = successful radio station ' is no longer relevant .
the quota has actually proved to be a financial success replacing repetitive set lists , which actually turned off listeners and consequently turned away advertisers .
through varied play schedules it has brought the audiences and advertising income back to the stations .
it has also succeeded in strengthening french radio culture by offering ambitious music programs which have helped the country 's musical culture as a whole .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo used to sing in german , now he mixes in english lyrics .
the decision by the government and the music industry in germany can be seen as a direct response to the failings of the public radio sector in fulfilling its cultural duty .
artists such as xavier naidoo and herbert grönemeyer consistently release material in the native language but the trend of german performers to push for a market further afield and release the bulk of their output in english has , for a long time , been supported by more and more radio programs .
bid to build stronger cultural identity the german music industry continues to develop a wide variety of music in difficult circumstances that is not presented at all on the radio .
the quota is designed to bring those who sing in their german mother tongue to a wider audience and help build a stronger musical and cultural identity in germany . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

a year after devastating floods lashed eastern germany , chancellor schröder is once again visiting the tiny saxon town of grimma , which became a potent symbol for the catastrophe and the consequent outpouring of aid . it was a picture that few in germany can forget .
chancellor gerhard schröder sloshing through knee-high water in his wellingtons , as he toured the submerged town of grimma in saxony in the immediate aftermath of the floods last year , shock written all over his face at the shambles around him .
it was in grimma that the chancellor announced his government ’ s emergency flood relief package worth € 385 million for the water-logged regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in grimma in august 2002 .
television images and photographs of the chancellor ’ s visit to the devastated town -lrb- photo -rrb- ensured that the 18,500-strong grimma became almost a household name in germany , symptomatic for the worst floods in more than 200 years .
many also believe the high-publicity visit helped schröder – in the thick of an election campaign – turn the tide of public opinion in his favor just ahead of voting in september .
now a year after that turbulent period , chancellor schröder is back in grimma to see for himself the progress the town has made in getting back on its feet .
on wednesday , justice minister brigitte zypries and saxon premier georg milbrandt accompany the chancellor on a tour of the town located on the banks of the mulde river .
shattered by the floods located 30 kilometers east of leipzig , grimma was hard hit by the deluge last august , when the swollen river mulde burst its banks and rushed into the town , swamping large parts of it .
about 40 buildings in the old town quarter were damaged beyond repair , 500 others were badly hit .
some 2,000 residential homes and 450 businesses were destroyed in 13 outlying districts .
the raging waters uprooted trees and lampposts , crippled public transport and ruined entire streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman removes the rubble out of her house in the village of grimma , germany , tuesday aug .
20 , 2002 .
about 2,200 residents were directly affected by the floods , many of them left homeless .
authorities estimated damages worth € 120 million , notwithstanding damages to buildings , which alone amounted to € 200 million .
at the time , aid workers and soldiers from the german armed forces rushed into the town to fill sandbags , strengthen dikes and help residents cope with the tragedy .
the residents of grimma mobilized themselves in what became a model example of solidarity in times of crisis .
financial aid flowed in from all parts of germany and even abroad , contributing more than € 12.5 million to the town ’ s official donation account .
" we ’ ve surfaced again " a year later , grimma is on the way to recovery .
at the end of october last year , it began rebuilding two of the worst-hit main streets , and since then the town resembles a construction site .
on wednesday , chancellor schröder officially reopens an almost 300-year-old pedestrian bridge over the mulde , badly destroyed by the floods and refurbished at a cost of € 360,000 .
he is also expected to speak with local businessmen and participate in an ecumenical church service in the evening .
the town and the surrounding districts have also organized a five-day series of events under the motto , " we ’ ve surfaced again , " the aim of which is to show how the region has made use of the generous aid it received and to thank the thousands of helpers who pitched in to save the town .
flood relief remains sticky issue saxon premier milbrandt said on tuesday he was pleased with the pace of rebuilding .
" we should make an effort to stick to deadlines , " he said .
" after all the money from berlin is not going to be endlessly available . "
but the issue of flood relief from schröder ’ s government remains a controversial one .
last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin was booed by local residents as he toured the city of dresden and surrounding areas to unveil a sweeping flood-prevention legislation package .
many demanded more federal aid for reconstruction and criticized the government for failing to honor promises made during last year 's election campaign .
even premier of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer demanded more flood relief from berlin , saying the refurbishment of dikes in his state by 2010 would cost up to € 310 million .
justice minister brigitte zypries however said in a radio interview earlier this week that the coordination of aid between the federal government and the states was functioning well .
but she admitted that the cooperation on the ground level , at the scene of destruction hadn ’ t always been " satisfactory . "
" we ’ ve clearly worked on that , we ’ ve passed new regulations and have worked on a new strategy to protect the population in germany , " she stressed .
" it ’ ll definitely be better the next time , " she added .

in a late-night session , the lower house of congress voted to scrap two key laws enacted soon after the regime fell .
a vocal minority of argentines say the military was just doing its duty the decision clears the way for hundreds of former military officers to be tried on charges of torture and murder .
in a packed chamber just before midnight , the congress effectively opened the book on one of the most painful and brutal periods of the nation 's history - the military dictatorship of 1976-1983 .
until now that book had been locked shut because of two laws which pardoned officers accused of human rights abuses and protected them from future prosecution .
but argentina 's president nestor kirchner came to office earlier this year promising to end impunity .
public opinion seems to have swung solidly behind him .
as congress finally declared the laws annulled , a crowd of supporters gathered outside the building erupted in applause .
just like with the nazis , wherever they go , we 'll seek them out chant from the crowd quoted in clarin newspaper press reflects vote doubts it was a historic step towards recovering the nation 's humanity , declared one deputy .
but this is only the beginning .
now the courts will have to sift through the thousands of allegations of torture and murder dating back to the period two decades ago commonly known as the dirty war .
human rights groups estimate that the regime kidnapped and executed as many as 30,000 people .
a vocal minority of argentines still insist that the military was simply doing its duty , defending the country from left-wing insurgents .
that view has now been swept aside , however .

in a late-night session , the lower house of congress voted to scrap two key laws enacted soon after the regime fell .
a vocal minority of argentines say the military was just doing its duty the decision clears the way for hundreds of former military officers to be tried on charges of torture and murder .
in a packed chamber just before midnight , the congress effectively opened the book on one of the most painful and brutal periods of the nation 's history - the military dictatorship of 1976-1983 .
until now that book had been locked shut because of two laws which pardoned officers accused of human rights abuses and protected them from future prosecution .
but argentina 's president nestor kirchner came to office earlier this year promising to end impunity .
public opinion seems to have swung solidly behind him .
as congress finally declared the laws annulled , a crowd of supporters gathered outside the building erupted in applause .

the report on the uk 's working mothers said 14 % go back to full-time work within the first year and a half of their child 's life .
it found that the reading , writing and speaking of these children , between the ages of two and eight , were " negatively affected " .
the bristol university study also found " significant ill-effects " on the development of children who were cared for by a friend , relative or neighbour while their mother worked .
the researchers assessed the development of more than 12,000 children born in 1991 and 1992 at four stages and compared the findings with their mother 's working patterns .
progress monitored the tests took place as part of the ongoing children of the 90s project , which is monitoring the progress of 14,000 children in the bristol area since 1991 .
the report read : " there are negative effects only for the relatively unusual group of children whose mothers return to full-time work before they are 18 months old .
" the magnitude of these effects is small , and only 14 % of mothers do go back to full-time work this early .
relatively few mothers in our study made use of paid care before their children reached the age of two paul gregg and liz washbrook " it is only those children whose non-parental care consists solely of unpaid care by a friend , relative or neighbour - such as a grandparent - who experience significant detrimental effects .
" short periods of care by relatives appear not to be damaging : it is sole reliance on relatives to cover fulltime working that appears to be less beneficial . "
the researchers also found maternal employment in the first three years of life appear to have no adverse effect on later cognitive outcomes .
' working mothers ' they said that policies which encourage flexible and part-time working practices , or enable mothers to remain at home for longer after a birth could minimise the negative effects , as could policies affecting paternity leave .
report authors paul gregg and liz washbrook said : " relatively few mothers in our study made use of paid care before their children reached the age of two , probably due to the prohibitive costs .
" the recent increases in financial support for childcare may lead to a shift towards paid care by working mothers . "

the financially-challenged firm racked up losses of 530.2bn won -lrb- $ 450m ; £ 270m -rrb- in the three months which ended in june .
that is a 27 % larger loss than suffered during the same three months a year earlier , dashing hopes that the semiconductor industry is on the road to recovery .
hynix blamed the iraq war and the sars outbreak in china for a slump in demand for personal computers , forcing it to dramatically cut chip prices .
despite the widening loss , hynix is once again predicting that it is over the worst and said its cost structure is improving .
however , its return to financial health is likely to be hindered by tuesday 's announcement that the eu and us will slap additional import tariffs on its memory chips .
hynix , meanwhile , has vowed to protect itself by widening its portfolio of chips away from its core memory product that are used in pcs .

its survey found swansea jail is the fifth most overcrowded prison in the two countries , while cardiff jail comes in at number six .
and cardiff , swansea and parc prison , in bridgend , are also above the england and wales average for the number of positive drug tests carried out .
the overcrowded conditions mean welsh prisons also failed to meet the recommended average of 24 hours a week of purposeful activity for each prisoner .

" people are going to be locked up for a lot longer , " she added .
" it 's going to be difficult to organise basic things like purposeful activity , showers , and contact with family - all the things that make a difference . "
the trust believes the problems will not be solved until the courts make greater use of community penalties and stop seeing a prison sentence as the only option after conviction .
report author enver solomon said : " this reveals a prison service severely hampered by a record prison population .
cardiff 's city centre prison has cramped conditions " far too many prisons are overcrowded , provide inadequate levels of purposeful activity and experience high levels of recorded drug use .
" the only way to improve these jails is immediately to reduce their populations . "
the prison reform trust report revealed that 2002 also saw a record number of suicides in england and wales - 105 - and more prisoners than ever also tested positive for drugs .

rabbi marvin hier , founder of the los angeles-based simon wiesenthal center , said the center had already received dozens of hate letters and calls he said were prompted by advance screening of the gibson-directed film the passion .
rabbi hier 's comments follow tuesday 's comments by jewish group the anti-defamation league that gibson 's film was " dangerous " for portraying jewish authorities and mobs as being behind the decision to crucify jesus .
" are there any manifestations of hate so far ?
the answer is an unequivocal yes , " rabbi hier said .
" we have had hate mail in the past ... but never in spurts like this . "
hier cited one writer who praised hitler as " much kinder to the jews than i would have been " .
denials gibson , a committed christian , shot the film in italy .
it stars the thin red line 's jim caviezel and monica bellucci , and features latin and aramaic dialogue , with no english subtitles .
gibson 's spokesman alan nierob said there was no suggestion of the film being anti-semitic .
" no one associated with this film has any interest in fuelling hatred , bigotry and anti-semitism .
in fact , mel 's interest is just the opposite as he has stated previously that this film is about love , hope , faith and forgiveness . "
the film has also been criticised by a group of catholic scholars , who saw an early version of the script and complained it was anti-catholic as well as anti-semitic .

the stretch of water on the grantham canal near cotgrave is so overgrown that some fishermen are going elsewhere .
anglers say up to 30 to 40 dead fish have floated to the surface of the canal near cotgrave country park .
british waterways says the problem has been caused by the hot weather increasing algae growth .
the algae are taking all the oxygen out of the water leaving suffocating some fish .
mick brookes is a regular canal user : " there 's probably 30 or 40 dead fish from little ones to good size ones .
" they are lying there on top of the water with flies all over them .
" this ca n't be good for the environment . "
british waterways says it is installing eight oxygen pumps in that stretch of the canal and its officers are carrying out daily inspections while continuing to clear vegetation .

" the cost to sky of football has not increased this year , and their future contract includes no real increase so there 's nothing in the background to force up their rates . "
mr hastings said many publicans and companies believe sky is exploiting the pub market , in a way that does not reflect their treatment of individual subscribers .
he noted that while pub prices continue to rise , to approximately £ 8.75 a match , prices for individuals have dipped or remained the same - around £ 1 a game .
" this decision will have a very real impact on community lives , three to four million people a week gather for football at pubs , and that focus will be denied . "

bbc news online looks at the appeal of slasher stars .
in a summer of cinema sequels , freddy vs jason is the only one with two mass murderers as its lead characters .
jason first appeared in 1980 's gory friday the 13th , then lurched his way through nine sequels .
meanwhile , freddy stalked teenagers in their dreams for 1984 's a nightmare on elm street , his razor glove terrorising them for a further six films .
but they are not the only two fictional murderers to become cult film icons .
we are also on first-name terms with michael myers -lrb- halloween -rrb- , hannibal lecter -lrb- the silence of the lambs -rrb- and damien -lrb- the omen -rrb- .
hannibal lecter was recently voted the top screen villain of all time but why do such bloodthirsty characters attract such a loyal following ?
" they do the kind of thing that we wish we could , " says tony timpone , editor of us horror magazine fangoria .
" we wish we had the power of jason to take out the bullies at school , or the cleverness of freddy to outwit our co-workers .
they appeal to the dark side of the movie-goer . "
while horror films are aimed at impressionable teenagers , dr david weeks - a consultant clinical neuropsychologist at the royal edinburgh hospital - is not convinced the fans identify with the killers .
" only a minority - between a quarter and a third of the audience - choose such negative role models , " he says .
" if you genuinely start aspiring to be the murderer you are obviously well on the way to becoming psychotic yourself . "
we can not admire heroes unless they face and conquer such strong adversaries dr david weeks royal edinburgh hospital this is supported by research which suggests that on-screen violence is most likely to influence viewers already predisposed to aggressive behaviour , he says .
" people do n't just watch these films because they love the killer , " dr weeks adds .
" there 's an aspect of voyeurism , the camera lingering as it finds each victim .
" horror movies also put us through a wide range of emotions from fear to disgust , and a need to escape . "
mr timpone says the challenge for film-makers is to create a compelling storyline between the killings .
" it is also important for these films to have a wicked sense of humour , to make them more palatable .
otherwise you are just left with a bloody mess . "
freddy vs jason producer sean s cunningham says his iconic anti-heroes represent " the faceless , unnamed fears " in our psyche .
eminem borrowed jason 's hockey mask style for his live shows " each of them has become a symbol of all those things that collectively we are afraid of , first as teenagers and then as adults , " he explains .
escaped psychopath michael myers was similarly described by halloween director john carpenter as " an irrational , unstoppable force of evil " while damien was literally the anti-christ .
when demonised in this way , the horror villain becomes strangely comforting .
" by seeing a face put to evil on the big screen it helps us deal with uncertain evils in the real world , such as a mysterious terror organisation or unknown bomber , " says mr timpone .
" people might get a kick out of all the gory darkness in these films , but ultimately they want to see the villain defeated and the world set straight by the end . "
strength and cunning superhuman killers also force heroines such as nancy in a nightmare on elm street , sidney from scream or jamie lee curtis ' halloween baby-sitter to draw upon hidden reserves of strength and cunning .
" we can not admire heroes unless they face and conquer such strong adversaries , " dr weeks says .
" in this respect , modern horror films follow ancient storytelling tradition .
" othello 's villain iago was also presented as purely evil but emerged to be more complex than that .
in fact villainous characters often prove to be the most interesting . "
with freddy vs jason expected to spawn even more sequels , movie murderers look likely to haunt us for some time to come .

the wru 's chief executive david moffett has urged cardiff city not to press ahead with the development .
he wants the club to use the millennium stadium - which would have the double benefit of removing competition for events and maximising use of the existing facilities .
the 74,000-seater stadium has been trying to attract a wider range of major sporting events , including show-jumping and boxing tournaments .

it is all thanks to what is being called " ubiquitous computing " , which means sticking programmable microchip sensors onto everyday household objects to make them a little bit smarter .
martin strohbach is a researcher with the smart-its project , a group of european universities working on the sensors .
he was sharing the group 's vision at the recent computer graphics siggraph exhibition in the us .
" we use tables and chairs and augment them with sensors .
for example , we have used a table as a mouse pointing interface so you can control the tv or computer , " he explained to go digital , the bbc world service radio programme .
chips with everything the smart-its project - a collaboration between lancaster university and several other institutions in zurich , germany , sweden and finland - has a vision to tag almost any object in the home with the microchips to make peoples ' daily lives easier .
bookshelves could start complaining if they are dangerously overloaded and water bottles could tell you if their contents need cooling .
it all sounds like a bit of fun , but there are more serious and possibly life-saving uses for the technology .
" it could be used in caring for elderly people .
the sensors would recognise if they have fallen on the floor or ca n't stand up anymore .
it 's much less intrusive than cameras , " strohbach says .
equally , that chatty , smart medicine cabinet could track and guide you through your medicine taking .
flatpack mishaps the chips have already been developed for diy flatpacks .
green and red lights on the various components sense movement and light up to let you know if you are attaching a chair leg to the wrong bit .
a dalek-like voice will embarrassingly inform you of your error before you make any permanent mistakes .
however , it remains to be seen whether diy enthusiasts prefer the blood , sweat and tears of trial and error over being told what to do .

the things we 're most interested in are type 1 diabetes and parkinson 's disease dr stephen minger king 's college london its success is the first since such experiments were approved in britain .
the researchers say they will use the cells to research treatments for parkinson 's disease and type 1 diabetes .
but anti-abortion organisations described the research as unethical and unnecessary .
ivf source the king 's cell line was grown from an embryo originally created as part of a course of in-vitro fertilisation -lrb- ivf -rrb- treatment .
under uk legislation , embryos created for ivf and not used after five years must be destroyed .
have your say stem cell research should continue helen kreissl , uk send us your comments the embryo used at king 's was one such embryo and was donated to the researchers by its biological parents , who have finished their ivf treatment .
at the time the cells were taken from the embryo it was a small clump of cells a few days old , visible only under a microscope .
scientists are interested in stem cells because they have the potential to become virtually any other kind of cell in the body and so might be used to replace tissues that have failed .
professor peter braude , who led the research team , told the bbc that the breakthrough of a " bank " of stem cells would greatly help research in the uk .
maximise researchers stem cells needed to be grown and verified to find out their real potential and this was difficult with a limited number of embryos , he said .
" this way we can maximise the number of researchers but minimise the number of embryos used for this purpose , " he said .
he explained that the cells were primitive and scientists were still a " long way " from turning them into , say , cells to be used in combating parkinson 's disease .
this -lsb- research -rsb- is compounding the injustice of what we do to these embryos by attempting to turn them into pharmaceutical products dr helen watt , linakre centre dr stephen minger , one of the lead scientists on the king 's project , told the bbc : " the things we 're most interested in are type 1 diabetes and parkinson 's disease .
" we already know that putting cells into patients with those diseases works but there 's a significant shortage of transplantable material .
" so our idea is to try to change these cells specifically into cells that make dopamine or cells that make insulin , " he said .
growing very large numbers of such cells might make it possible to treat more than just the handful of patients who have currently been able to receive transplants from conventional sources , dr minger said .
sharing the cells there are only around a dozen lines of cells cultivated from human embryos available to researchers in the world and the creation of a uk source for the cells will make access in europe much easier .
dr stephen minger , king 's college london stem cells were first grown from human embryos over four years ago .
the king 's line will be deposited in a european stem cell bank based in hertfordshire , england .
the team at king 's was one of the first two to gain a licence from the uk regulatory body in this area - the human fertilisation and embryology authority - to carry out such work after the house of lords recommended approving human embryonic stem cell research in 2002 .
they will now go on to try to develop procedures to guide and control the growth of stem cells so that they reliably generate useful types of cell .
ethical objections a spokeswoman for the pro-life alliance party , a european grouping opposed to abortion , told the bbc that the extraction of stem cells from human embryos was unethical .

" this -lsb- research -rsb- is compounding the injustice of what we do to these embryos by attempting to turn them into pharmaceutical products . "

this -lsb- research -rsb- is compounding the injustice of what we do to these embryos by attempting to turn them into pharmaceutical products " dr helen watt , linakre centre dr stephen minger , one of the lead scientists on the king 's project , told the bbc : " the things we 're most interested in are type 1 diabetes and parkinson 's disease .
" we already know that putting cells into patients with those diseases works but there 's a significant shortage of transplantable material .
" so our idea is to try to change these cells specifically into cells that make dopamine or cells that make insulin , " he said .
growing very large numbers of such cells might make it possible to treat more than just the handful of patients who have currently been able to receive transplants from conventional sources , dr minger said .
sharing the cells there are only around a dozen lines of cells cultivated from human embryos available to researchers in the world and the creation of a uk source for the cells will make access in europe much easier .
stem cells were first grown from human embryos over four years ago .
the king 's line will be deposited in a european stem cell bank based in hertfordshire , england .
the team at king 's was one of the first two to gain a licence from the uk regulatory body in this area - the human fertilisation and embryology authority - to carry out such work after the house of lords recommended approving human embryonic stem cell research in 2002 .
they will now go on to try to develop procedures to guide and control the growth of stem cells so that they reliably generate useful types of cell .
ethical objections a spokeswoman for the pro-life alliance party , a european grouping opposed to abortion , told the bbc that the extraction of stem cells from human embryos was unethical .
and dr helen watt , of the linacre centre which advises the catholic church on bio-ethics , said the research violated the human rights and interests of the embryos .
she said the embryos were only discarded because they were " chosen to be " .
" this -lsb- research -rsb- is compounding the injustice of what we do to these embryos by attempting to turn them into pharmaceutical products . "
but sir george radda , chief executive of the medical research council , said the research was legal and used because current research on adult stem cells had not yet proved a complete success in finding ways to help human health .

every hospital in england has been given a " traffic light " rating by the department of health based on a series of inspections of both cleanliness and catering .
results published on wednesday show 192 hospitals were awarded the top " green " rating for cleanliness and food , double the number that received the rating last year .
the latest assessment gave 78 % of hospitals a green rating for their cleanliness , up from 60 % last year .
the ratings bear no relation to the quality of care that patients are receiving dr liam fox , shadow health secretary and it reported a rapid improvement in catering standards , with 43 % of hospitals given a green rating , up from 17 % last year .
no hospitals were given the lowest " red " rating for cleanliness or food standards , health minister , lord norman warner said : " there is still more to do before we provide the high standards which always meet patient needs and generally exceed their expectations but these latest results show that we have made progress towards consistently high quality hospital food services that are well-regarded by patients . "
controversy however , there is some dispute over the validity of the ratings system .
a recent nhs national patient survey continued to highlight concerns over hospital cleanliness among patients - more than one in ten thought the toilet on their ward was dirty , and 7 % thought the ward itself was not clean .
reports suggest that the level of " hospital-acquired infections " is actually rising fast .
some experts have criticised handwashing facilities at certain hospitals .
they say that it is not always possible for health staff to wash their hands in between treating each patient - which could contribute to the spread of infection .
criticism shadow health secretary dr liam fox mp , said 15 out of 20 hospitals with the highest levels of the mrsa superbug infection had been given a green rating .
he said : " everybody knows that you ca n't trust the department of health 's statistics assessing their own performance when they are created by the department of health itself .
" the picture painted by a department of health 's recent survey of 95,000 patients revealed that 11 % of patients said bathrooms and toilets were dirty and 7 % said the same about wards .
" surely this should set alarm bells ringing ?
in an average hospital of 14 wards , one of those wards could be expected to be dirty .
" today 's figures merely undermine the credibility of the star ratings system even further .
" the ratings bear no relation to the quality of care that patients are receiving . "
he added : " the government must start to put patients first and stop using the nhs for their own political ends .
liberal democrat health spokesman dr evan harris mp said : " the clean hospital programme should be prosecuted under the trade description act .
it is nothing of the sort .
" it covers different standards of which only one is about cleanliness and none are about the control of infection . "
he added : " the government regularly uses the clean hospital programme as evidence that they are tackling the problem .
" the reality is that this measure should give no-one cause for confidence .
it measures the wrong things and fails to measure them well . "

" the partnership between the uk government and the scottish executive is delivering results where it counts , making a real difference to people lives . "

more than 40 % of those who sat the exam this year failed - and more than a quarter of them scored 30 % or less .
those figures have prompted criticism of the new-look exam , which was reshaped by the scottish qualification authority .
the sqa said it would listen to concerns - although communications manager mike haggerty warned against any " knee-jerk reactions " .
figures released as pupils received their results on tuesday showed that 59.2 % of candidates passed higher english this year , compared to 64.7 % in 2002 .
by contrast , the pass rate for higher maths rose from 64.3 % to 66.8 % .
' possibly the worst ' overall , the higher pass rate fell for the second year in a row .
the critics of the english exam include brian boyd , a reader in education at strathclyde university .
he said : " the present higher english examination is possibly the worst higher english examination in my 33 years of teaching .
" it has been changed four times in the last four years and i think teachers are simply at sixes and sevens as to how best to prepare young people .
careers scotland a helpline is available on 0800 100 8000 lines are open on wednesday 13 august from 0800 bst to 2000 bst from thursday 14 august to friday 22 august lines are open 1000 bst to 1800 bst " it seems to me that once the dust has settled on this particular set of results we have got to have a rethink . "
mr boyd said it was " ludicrous " that the current examination failed to test key writing and speaking skills .
he argued that there were two " key types of writing " which should be assessed - creative writing in its various forms and report writing .
the sqa was advised on the structure of the new exam by a committee chaired by glasgow headteacher ken cunningham .
he said that the decision to drop the creative writing element should be reversed .
he also voiced concerns that pupils in third and fourth year were not being sufficiently prepared for the demands of the higher english syllabus .
assessment load mr haggerty said that this year 's examination had been changed as part of the national qualifications review .
" everyone in the education community was looking for a reduction in the assessment load for pupils and teachers alike , " he said .
he drew a comparison with higher maths , which he said had now " bedded down " and shown improvements in attainment and pass levels .
pupils received their results on tuesday " there is a benefit from having a period of stability , but clearly our responsibility is to take account of all these views to try to map out a successful way forward .
" i think we need to reflect on the experience , which is only 24 hours old .
" it would be a mistake to make any sort of knee-jerk reaction at this stage , but we do know that we need to listen , we know that we need to consult , " he said .
professional development workshops are being held across the country which will give teachers the chance to put forward their views .
" that is a real opportunity for everyone who wants to have their say and for us to listen to what they have to say , " added mr haggerty .

more than 40 % of those who sat the exam this year failed - and more than a quarter of them scored 30 % or less .
those figures have prompted criticism of the new-look exam , which was reshaped by the scottish qualification authority .
the sqa said it would listen to concerns - although communications manager mike haggerty warned against any " knee-jerk reactions " .
figures released as pupils received their results on tuesday showed that 59.2 % of candidates passed higher english this year , compared to 64.7 % in 2002 .
by contrast , the pass rate for higher maths rose from 64.3 % to 66.8 % .
' possibly the worst ' overall , the higher pass rate fell for the second year in a row .
the critics of the english exam include brian boyd , a reader in education at strathclyde university .
he said : " the present higher english examination is possibly the worst higher english examination in my 33 years of teaching .
" it has been changed four times in the last four years and i think teachers are simply at sixes and sevens as to how best to prepare young people .

"
mr boyd said it was " ludicrous " that the current examination failed to test key writing and speaking skills .
he argued that there were two " key types of writing " which should be assessed - creative writing in its various forms and report writing .
the sqa was advised on the structure of the new exam by a committee chaired by glasgow headteacher ken cunningham .
he said that the decision to drop the creative writing element should be reversed .
he also voiced concerns that pupils in third and fourth year were not being sufficiently prepared for the demands of the higher english syllabus .
assessment load mr haggerty said that this year 's examination had been changed as part of the national qualifications review .
" everyone in the education community was looking for a reduction in the assessment load for pupils and teachers alike , " he said .
he drew a comparison with higher maths , which he said had now " bedded down " and shown improvements in attainment and pass levels .
pupils received their results on tuesday " there is a benefit from having a period of stability , but clearly our responsibility is to take account of all these views to try to map out a successful way forward .
" i think we need to reflect on the experience , which is only 24 hours old .

the jennifer lopez and ben affleck movie has been panned by critics and took under $ 6m -lrb- £ 3.7m -rrb- in its opening 10 days .
now alternative rock station wbcn is offering " i survived gigli " t-shirts to listeners who manage to sit through the entire film on its closing night .
the movie ends its short cinema run on thursday .
wbcn 's tongue-in-cheek competition has the promotional line " from the station that puts you in the movies whether you like it or not " .
" we 're doing this because the movie 's been such a bomb , " said chachi loprete , the station 's creative services director .
he added that the station was offering free tickets to the screening at a boston cinema to 130 " lucky " listeners .
' misconceived ' some critics of gigli , starring affleck as a tough criminal and lopez as a lesbian assassin , have dubbed the movie the worst film of the year .
the new york times called it a " hopelessly misconceived exercise in celebrity self-worship " , while the washington post said it was " slack , dreary and , oh yes , nasty , brutish and long " .
affleck has admitted the film was not as good as it should have been , but said there were some good scenes in it .
the couple 's forthcoming wedding also overshadowed the promotion of the movie as everyone clamoured to find out where the ceremony would be held .

ifor williams trailers plans to open a new manufacturing plant on the deeside industrial estate , creating 80 new jobs .
the news revealed on wednesday came just a day after more than 200 workers staged a one-day strike in protest at pay and conditions .
representatives from the gmb union , which represents half the 400-strong workforce - are planning to meet with conciliation service in a final effort to resolve the dispute .
a meeting will be held in chester on wednesday to try and iron out the differences , the most contentious of which is the pay rate for night shifts .
the workers have now held two one-day strikes in the space of four weeks , and organised a protest march to draw attention to their cause at the weekend .
ifor williams has factories in cynwyd , bala and corwen .
news of the expansion and the extra jobs will come as a welcome boost to the north east .
craig allen , manager of the deeside operation said : " the company has seen growing demand across the range of trailers we produce and this has been particularly marked for some models .
" we are planning to open new production lines at the deeside facility for the trailers that have been in particularly high demand . "
ifor williams trailers was founded in 1958 , and manufactures agricultural trailers and horseboxes which are sold throughout the uk and abroad .
despite the jobs news , union officials are continuing with the acas negotiations .
" we are pleased that a meeting with the company and acas has now been agreed , " said gmb regional organiser dave cliff .
" i hope that we can move forward with sensible negotiations to reach a fair and just settlement to this dispute . "
